# todo: we need to be able to follow directions that require step by step thought process and answer with the format asked.

# The MMLU-Pro prompt looks like this:
# The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about {$}. Think step by step and then finish your answer with "the answer is (X)" where X is the correct letter choice.

# should also be able to handle simple format like
# Q: <question?>
# A: <our answer>


# getting the right answer, but not following the structure will fail the test.
