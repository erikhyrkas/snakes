class StateSpaceModelAttentionWithSSD(nn.Module):
    """
    This is the in-progress attention for the YS v0.2 base model. One of the big changes to the overall LLM
    architecture that this introduces is the need for RoPE. I was pretty excited about not having positional
    embedding with v0.1, but for multi-head attention to work well, it seems like positional encoding is the way to go.

    Implementation Summary:
    -----------------------
    * State Space Model Focused -- Prioritizes sequential processing for hardware efficiency.
    * State Space Duality -- Balances linear and quadratic SSMs for efficiency vs. quality flexibility.
    * Structured Processing for Quadratic SSMs -- Applies structured methods to efficiently manage quadratic operations.
    * Block Decomposition of Semiseparable Matrices -- Optimizes memory usage by breaking down large matrices.
    * Layer Normalization -- Stabilizes outputs across sequential and attention layers.
    * Multi-Head SSM with Grouped-Value Attention -- Extends the traditional multi-head attention for SSMs to improve performance and parallelism.
    * Memory and Numerical Stability -- Uses small random initialization with added constants to ensure stability.
    * Dropout Regularization -- Prevents overfitting, particularly important in sequential models with SSMs.

    This class is optimized for efficient, sequential attention processing using structured state space models (SSMs),
    tailored for environments with limited hardware resources.

    Techniques Utilized and Their Benefits:
    ---------------------------------------
    This implementation leverages advanced techniques from state space models (SSMs) to optimize both performance and
    efficiency. By employing the State Space Duality (SSD) framework, the model seamlessly balances linear and
    quadratic processing, ensuring that it can adapt to varying sequence lengths and computational demands. The use
    of structured semiseparable matrices allows for efficient memory usage, enabling the model to handle larger state
    sizes without compromising speed. The multi-head SSM design, combined with Grouped-Value Attention (GVA),
    enhances parallelism and performance, especially in large-scale models. Layer normalization and dropout are
    critical for maintaining numerical stability and preventing overfitting, especially in deep learning environments
    with long sequences. These techniques, inspired by recent advancements in SSMs, enable the model to achieve high
    performance on language modeling tasks with reduced computational overhead.

    Note on Grouped-Value Attention:
    --------------------------------
    Grouped-Value Attention (GVA) is a key component of this model's design. Unlike traditional multi-head attention,
    where each attention head has its own set of value vectors, GVA groups the value vectors, allowing multiple heads
    to share the same set of value vectors. This grouping significantly reduces the number of parameters and memory
    usage, making the model more efficient without sacrificing performance.

    In traditional multi-head attention, each head independently processes its own queries, keys, and values, resulting
    in a large number of parameters and high computational cost, especially as the number of heads increases. GVA, on
    the other hand, reduces the redundancy in value processing by grouping the values, which allows for better parameter
    sharing across heads.

    The benefits of GVA include:
    - **Reduced Memory Footprint:** By sharing value vectors across multiple heads, GVA reduces the memory required for
      storing these vectors, making the model more suitable for environments with limited resources.
    - **Increased Computational Efficiency:** The grouped approach allows for more efficient computation, as the model
      needs to process fewer unique value vectors while still maintaining the benefits of multi-head attention.
    - **Scalability:** GVA makes it easier to scale the model to a larger number of heads without a proportional increase
      in memory and computational requirements, enabling the model to handle more complex tasks with higher efficiency.

    Overall, GVA is a crucial technique in this implementation that balances the need for multi-head diversity with the
    practical constraints of memory and computational resources, making it an ideal choice for state space models used
    in this context.
