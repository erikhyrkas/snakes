3. **Patience**: Training takes time, so be patient with your dog.
4. **Clear Communication**: Use a firm but gentle tone to communicate with your dog.

**Basic Commands**

1. **Sit**:
	* Hold a treat above your dog's head.
	* Move it backwards and upwards towards their tail.
	* As they follow the treat, their bottom will lower into a sitting position.
	* Reward and repeat.
2. **Stay**:
	* Have your dog sit or lie down.
	* Take a few steps back and say "stay."
	* Gradually increase the distance and time you're away from them.

3. **Come**:
	* Start with short distances (e.g., 5-10 feet).
	* Call your dog's name, followed by "come" or a specific recall word.
	* Reward upon their return.
	* Gradually increase the distance and distractions.

**Advanced Training**

1. **Leash Walking**:

How do I start knitting?<start>Starting to knit can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

**Gather the basics**

1. **Knitting needles**: Also called "straight needles" or "single-pointed needles," these are the long, straight rods used for knitting. You can choose from aluminum, wood, or plastic needles in various sizes.
2. **Yarn**: Choose a yarn that suits your project and personal preferences. Consider factors like fiber content (wool, cotton, acrylic), weight (thickness), color, and texture.
3. **Scissors**: Good-quality scissors are essential for cutting the yarn as needed.
4. **Tapestry needle**: A blunt-tipped needle used to weave in ends and sew seams.
5. **Measuring tape or ruler**: To measure your work.

**Learn the basic stitches**

1. **Find online tutorials or classes**: Websites like YouTube, Craftsy, and Moogly have excellent video tutorials for beginners.
2. **Practice with a simple project**: Start with a scarf, hat, or dishcloth to get familiar with knitting basics.
3. **Understand the two main stitches**:
	* **Garter stitch (knit every row)**: Creates a textured fabric with rows of bumps.
	* **Stockinette stitch (knit one row, purl one row)**: Produces a smooth, flat fabric.

**Get comfortable with your needles and yarn**

1. **Hold the needles correctly**: Hold the needle in your non-dominant hand, with the point facing away from you.
2. **Cast on**: The process of putting stitches onto your needles. This is usually done at the beginning of a project.
3. **Practice knitting and purling**: Start with short rows to get a feel for the stitches.

**Additional tips**

1. **Start with a simple pattern**: Look for patterns labeled "beginner-friendly" or "easy."
2. **Watch your tension**: Pay attention to how tightly or loosely you're holding the yarn, as this affects the fabric's texture.
3. **Don't be afraid to make mistakes**: They're an opportunity to learn and improve.

**Getting more help**

1. **Join a knitting community**: Online forums like Ravelry or local knitting groups can connect you with experienced knitters who'll guide you through any challenges.
2. **Find a mentor**: Ask a friend or family member with knitting experience to show you the ropes.

Remember, practice is key! Don't be discouraged if your stitches are uneven at first. With time and patience, you'll develop muscle memory and become more confident in your knitting skills.

4. **Make an incision:**
Hold the knife at a 45-degree angle and make a cut along both sides of the spine, from head to tail. Be careful not to cut too deeply on either side.
5. **Release the flesh:**
Gently pry open the two fillets by inserting your thumbs or fingers between them, just below the incision.
6. **Separate the fillets:**
Continue making gentle pressure with your thumbs or fingers until the fillets are completely separated from each other and from any remaining bones.
7. **Remove bloodline (optional):**
If you notice a red line running along the spine of one or both fillets, it's the bloodline. You can carefully trim this off using the tip of your knife.

**Tips and Variations:**

* Use a pair of tweezers to gently remove any remaining bones or cartilage.
* For larger fish, you may want to cut them in half before filleting each side separately.
* If you're new to filleting, consider starting with smaller fish like trout or tilapia.

**Safety Reminders:**

* Always use a sharp knife and handle it carefully.
* Keep your fingers away from the blade.
* Be mindful of any bones that may break off while cutting.
* Clean and sanitize your workspace before and after handling raw fish.

Practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if you encounter some difficulties at first. With time and patience, you'll become proficient in filleting fish like a pro!
