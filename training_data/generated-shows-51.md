INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - DAY

We see a small, cluttered antique shop filled with old furniture and knick-knacks. The proprietor, MRS. JENKINS (60s), is dusting an old piano while a customer, SARAH (30s), browses the shelves.

MRS. JENKINS
Can I help you find something?

SARAH
Just looking for now. Thanks.

As Sarah continues to browse, her eyes land on an old trunk in the corner of the shop. She walks over to it and begins to examine the intricate carvings on its lid.

CUT TO:

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Sarah is rummaging through a large box in her attic. As she lifts out an old, dusty photo album, we see flashes of her childhood: her parents smiling and happy, family vacations, etc.

SARAH (V.O.)
I used to love playing up here when I was a kid. My mom would let me come and explore while my dad worked in his study downstairs.

As Sarah flips through the pages, she comes across a photograph of her mother holding a baby boy. The camera pans out to reveal that it's not just any baby - it's Sarah herself, as a newborn.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - DAY

Sarah walks back into Mrs. Jenkins' shop, photo album still in hand. She approaches the counter and begins to show Mrs. Jenkins the pictures.

MRS. JENKINS
Oh dear, that looks like an old family heirloom. What's going on?

SARAH
(nervously)
I... I found it up in my attic today. And then I saw this trunk in your shop, with similar carvings...

MRS. JENKINS
(concerned)
You shouldn't be playing around with things you don't understand.

Suddenly, Sarah's phone rings. She hesitates for a moment before answering it.

SARAH
(into phone)
Mom?

CUT TO:

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Sarah is in her childhood bedroom, staring at an old diary belonging to her mother. As she flips through the pages, we see entries detailing a tragic family secret: Sarah's father was not who he seemed to be.

SARAH (V.O.)
My mom used to tell me that my dad was a wonderful man, but I never saw him around much. She said it was because of his job...

As Sarah reads on, she discovers that her father was involved in some shady dealings and had been hiding the truth from his family for years.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - DAY

Sarah hangs up the phone and looks at Mrs. Jenkins with a mixture of shock and understanding.

SARAH
(whispering)
I... I found out something today. Something that's been hidden in my family for a long time.

Mrs. Jenkins nods, as if she knew all along.

MRS. JENKINS
(smiling wistfully)
There are always secrets hidden in the attic, dear. But sometimes, it takes a trip down memory lane to uncover them.

We see a group of young adults gathered around a large screen displaying a video feed from various security cameras throughout the city. They're all dressed in casual attire, but it's clear they're not just civilians.

JENNY (28), a no-nonsense leader with short brown hair and piercing green eyes, stands at the front of the room addressing her team.

JENNY
Alright, listen up! Tonight's been a weird night. Reports are coming in about multiple instances of extreme weather phenomena across the city - tornadoes, hail storms, the works.

One of the team members, a tech-savvy individual named MARCO (25), speaks up.

MARCO
Guys, I've been tracking these events. They're all centered around... this location.

Marco zooms in on a specific area of the screen, showing a peculiar energy signature emanating from an abandoned warehouse.

JENNY

Get to it. See what you can find out.

The team springs into action, dispersing throughout the headquarters to start researching and preparing for their mission.

Alright, guys. We've got a clear area ahead. Let's move out.

As they proceed deeper into the warehouse, strange occurrences start to plague their equipment and environment. Equipment malfunctions, and severe weather effects begin to manifest around them.

MAYA
(alarmed)
What is this? Some kind of feedback loop?

DAKOTA
(concerned)
Get back! It's spreading!

The team quickly retreats as a massive storm erupts within the warehouse. They barely escape with their lives, watching in awe as the structure crumbles behind them.

CUT TO:

INT. S.H.A.D.E. HEADQUARTERS - LATER

Back at headquarters, Jenny assembles her team to analyze the events of the night.

JENNY

Whatever that thing was, it's got us stumped. We can't let this keep happening.

MARCO

Ma'am, I think we're seeing a pattern here. These incidents are all connected to... (pauses for emphasis) ...you.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

We see a small, quaint library tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. The shelves are lined with dusty tomes and the air is thick with the scent of old books.

We meet our protagonist, JESSICA (30s), a gentle soul with a passion for history. She's on a mission to catalog the library's vast collection of antique texts.

As Jessica delves deeper into the stacks, she stumbles upon an ancient tome bound in worn leather. The title reads: "The Journal of Emily Windsor".

Jessica is fascinated by the journal and begins to read from it. As she turns the pages, we see flashbacks of a young woman named EMILY (20s) living in the same library many years ago.

**Act II:**

INT. LIBRARY - FLASHBACKS

Emily is shown to be a kind-hearted soul who has taken on the responsibility of caring for the library's collection. As she works, we see glimpses of her daily life: reading from the books, writing in her own journal, and interacting with a handsome stranger named JACK (20s).

Jessica becomes increasingly enthralled by Emily's story, and as she reads on, we see that Jack is somehow connected to Emily's past. But their relationship is complicated, and Jessica begins to realize that Emily's memories may be tied to the mysterious disappearance of a valuable book from the library's collection.

**Act III:**

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

As Jessica delves deeper into Emily's journal, she realizes that the events described within are eerily similar to her own life. She begins to question whether her experiences are real or just echoes from yesterday.

Jessica becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth about Emily and the missing book. She searches the library for clues, following a trail of cryptic hints left behind by Emily.

As she digs deeper, Jessica's world starts to blur, and we see that she is somehow connected to Emily in ways both seen and unseen.

**Act IV:**

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Jessica finally uncovers the truth about the missing book and Emily's disappearance. In a shocking twist, it's revealed that Jack was a key player in the events of yesterday, but his identity is shrouded in mystery.

As Jessica pieces together the puzzle, she comes face-to-face with an enigmatic figure who claims to be the guardian of the library's secrets. The figure reveals that Jessica has been chosen to inherit Emily's legacy as the Memory Keeper of the Library.

In a bittersweet conclusion, Jessica is left with more questions than answers. As she looks upon Emily's journal, now her own possession, we see that Jessica's memories are forever intertwined with those of Emily, and their stories will continue to echo through the ages.

We enter a cozy living room where Detective Emily Windsor (35) sits on a couch, sipping a cup of coffee and staring at her phone. Her partner, Detective James Parker (40), enters the room, looking concerned.

DETECTIVE PARKER
Emily, we've got a weird one here. The body was discovered by the homeowner, Mr. Jenkins, around 7:00 am this morning.

DETECTIVE WINDSOR

What do you mean, "a weird one"?

DETECTIVE PARKER
(hesitant)
The victim... it's not who we thought it was.

Jessica's father, MARK (40s), sits at the kitchen table, staring at a newspaper article.

MARK: (to his wife, SHARON) You think she suspects?

SHARON: (nervously) I don't know what to say...

Cut back to present-day Jessica, who enters the abandoned house and begins rummaging through old family photographs.

JESSICA: (whispering) What did you do? What secrets were you hiding from me?

Jessica: (excitedly) Sarah, I got some great news! The marketing campaign for our new project is going amazingly well.

Sarah: (smiling) That's fantastic! You're really crushing it this time around. When do we get the results?

Jessica: In two weeks. But honestly? I think we've already won whatever pitch we were going for. Our numbers are through the roof!

As they chat, Jessica's phone rings. She answers, and her demeanor instantly changes.

Jessica: (alarmed) I have to go.

Sarah: What's wrong?

Jessica: (nervously) Nothing, just family stuff.

Jessica hurries away, leaving Sarah looking concerned.

Cut to Jessica's home, where we see a split screen of two different timelines. On the left side, Jessica is with her loving husband, MIKE (35), celebrating their anniversary with champagne and laughter. They seem happy and in love.

On the right side, we see a dark and sinister plot unfold. A detective, TOM (40s), interrogates Mike about his involvement in a major scandal involving corporate espionage and bribery. Mike's alibi falls apart as evidence mounts against him.

The timelines merge into one reality: Jessica returns home to find her husband arrested by Detective Tom.

Jessica: (horrified) Mike...no!

Mike: (defeated) I'm sorry, Jess. It was just business.

As the scene fades out, we see a flash of a newspaper clipping with the headline: "CEO Arrested in Major Bribery Scandal".

**Act III:**

Jessica is shown breaking down in tears as she tries to process what's happening. Detective Tom arrives at her doorstep, informing her that Mike has been charged with bribery and corporate espionage.

Tom: I'm afraid this involves you too, Jessica. We have evidence of your complicity in covering up the scandal.

Jessica: (outraged) That's not true! You have to listen to me!

As the detective leaves, we see a mysterious figure watching from across the street. It's revealed that this person is JASON (30s), Mike's business partner and the mastermind behind the bribery scheme.

Jason: (smirking to himself) Time to make an example of her too.

The episode ends with Jessica staring at her shattered illusion of perfection, realizing she may have been part of a much larger web of deceit than she ever imagined. The screen fades to black as the sound of shattering glass echoes in the background.<end>

Oh no, oh no, oh no... I'm going to kill myself moving today.

Told you it was going to be a long day. But hey, at least we're in this together now!

Jessica hands Sarah a box marked "Kitchenware".

JESS

Okay, so like, I've got the essentials here - plates, bowls, utensils...

SARAH
(starting to dig through the box)
And... is that a VHS player?

JESS
( sheepishly)
Oh, yeah. I didn't think anyone actually used those anymore.

Sarah starts rummaging through the rest of the box, pulling out an assortment of expired coupons and broken appliances.

SARAH
(laughing)
This is like a thrift store in here!

Jessica tries to intervene as Sarah continues to dig through her belongings.

JESS
(trying to sound nonchalant)
So, uh, I thought we could split the bills 50/50. That way, it's not too bad...

SARAH
(munching on a stale cookie from the box)
Sounds good! But only if you agree to never eat my food.

Jessica hesitantly agrees, and they seal the deal with a handshake. Sarah starts unpacking her own boxes, unearthing a series of bizarre items: a collection of antique teapots, an inflatable unicorn pool float, and a vintage taxidermy mouse.

JESS
(uncomfortable)
Uh... I think that's going to go in your room.

SARAH
(grinning mischievously)
Don't be such a party pooper! We're just getting started here!

Jason convinces Mike and Sarah to help him create a viral social media challenge.

As the friends are finishing up the video, Mike starts getting a bit too into character.

Jason looks uncomfortable as his friends start to get more and more ridiculous in their performances.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - LATER

Jason uploads the video to Instagram, and it starts getting a surprising number of views... but also some harsh comments.

JASON (V.O)
Uh-oh... I think we might have made a social media mistake...

As Jason reads through the comments, his friends start to chime in with their own opinions on the challenge.

MIKE
(sarcastically)
Yeah, because nothing says "relatable" like a 30-second video of three adults doing a awkward dance.

SARAH
(laughing)
And what's next? The Jason Sway?

JASON

Hey, it was just for fun!

Eira
(eyeing the fire)
This is our third night in Wyrmhaven. We've been searching for any sign of the Red Hand, but so far, nothing.

Kael

It's a ghost town, girl. There's nothing here worth fighting for... except maybe some rumors of a hidden stash of dragonsteel.

Aye, it is. And myths are often rooted in truth. We'll keep searching.

Well, well, look what we've got here. A whole crew of heroes, come to save us poor bandits from ourselves.

Ah, you want the dragonsteel? Alright then. I'll let you have it... for a price.

What's the catch, Grax?

Grax
(grinning)
You see, we've got something that might interest you lot. A mysterious fire is burning out in the wilderness. And rumor has it... it's getting stronger by the day.

Eira

Kael

You think it's... magic?

Arin

I don't know... but I feel something. Something... important.

Zyl
(her voice carried on the wind)
You should not have come here. This is... my place.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

EXT. MUNICH - DAY

We see a mysterious figure watching Sophie from across the square. He is tall and dark-haired, dressed in simple yet elegant attire. This is FRANZ (28), Count Franz von Walburg.

CUT TO:

INT. DUCAL CHAMBERS - DAY

Duke Leopold summons the Imperial Envoy, COUNT HABSBURG (40s). The Duke demands to know why Sophie's marriage has not been arranged yet.

COUNT HABSBURG:
(humbly)
Your Grace, we have been searching for a suitable suitor. But I fear that the Count von Walburg...he is not of noble birth in the classical sense...

DUKE LEOPOLD:
(interrupting)
Enough! He will do. See to it that Sophie marries him within a fortnight.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

EXT. MUNICH - DAY (LATER)

Franz appears at the Duke's chambers, begging for an audience with Sophie. The Duke reluctantly grants Franz permission to speak to his daughter.

SOPHIE:
(whispering)
Franz, I never wanted this...but now that I've met you...I don't know what to do.

FRANZ:
(taking her hand)
You will choose me, Sophie. You will choose your heart over duty and tradition.

**Act IV:**

We see JESSICA (28), a driven and ambitious young lawyer, sitting at her desk, staring at a stack of paperwork in front of her. Her phone rings, and she answers it, before being handed the receiver by her colleague, MIKE.

MIKE
(hesitantly)
Jess, I need to talk to you about something.

JESSICA
(interrupting him)
What is it?

MIKE
(sighs)
It's just...the firm's not doing well. We've been struggling to keep up with the bills and the rent. And now...

Jessica cuts him off again, her expression a mix of concern and determination.

JESSICA
(firmly)
I know all about that, Mike. My father and I have been discussing ways to turn things around. We just need to get the right case, you know?

Mike looks on uncertainly, before Jessica turns back to her phone call.

MIKE

Yeah...

CUT TO:

INT. LEGACY LAW FIRM - DAY

Jessica is sitting at a conference table with her father, TOM (50s). They're both poring over some documents and looking at each other nervously.

We can't let this happen to us, Jess. We've worked too hard for it.

JESSICA

I know, Dad. But we need a plan. A way to get back on our feet.

INT. LEGACY LAW FIRM - DAY

Jessica and her team are huddled around a whiteboard, brainstorming ideas for their next big case. Jessica is scribbling away furiously, as her colleagues share their thoughts.

MIKE

Guys...I think we're getting ahead of ourselves here...

JESSICA
(excitedly)
No way! This could be it! The case that changes everything!

The team shares a moment of excitement and optimism before the mood is quickly deflated by the arrival of Jessica's colleague, LUCAS (30s).

LUCAS
(coolly)
Hey guys...Jessica...can I have a word?

JESSICA
(distracted)
What is it, Lucas?

Lucas pulls her aside and whispers something in her ear. Her expression changes from enthusiasm to concern.

LUCAS
(serious)
You need to know that Tom's been acting really strange lately. I don't know what's going on, but I think you should talk to him about it...

Jessica looks worried as the camera lingers on her face before fading to black.

Tom is sitting in his office, staring at a photo of his wife who passed away several years ago. Jessica enters and clears her throat to get his attention.

JESSICA

Dad...can we talk?

TOM
(startled)
Oh...Jess...what's wrong?

Jessica approaches him cautiously before sitting down in the chair opposite him.

JESSICA
(concerned)
Lucas told me you've been acting strange lately. I think it might be related to this case...

Tom looks up at her, his eyes welling up with tears.

TOM
(hushed)
It's just...the weight of everything is getting too much for me sometimes. And I'm afraid...

Jessica reaches out and takes his hand in hers.

JESSICA
(firmly)
We'll get through this together, Dad. As a team. We always do.

INT. QUANTUM CRUSADERS HANGAR - DAY

We see four heroes, each with unique abilities, gathered around a holographic display projected by their leader, ASTRAL (30s, Asian-American woman).

ASTRAL
Alright, team! Our quantum sensors have picked up an anomaly in the energy grid. It's located downtown.

QUARK (20s, African- American man) looks at his wristwatch, which displays a complex network of lines and symbols.

QUARK
That's not just any anomaly, Astral. This is a rift in the fabric of space-time itself.

ASTRAL
We need to get there ASAP. Quark, can you generate a quantum portal?

QUARK
Already on it.

Quark snaps his fingers, and a shimmering portal appears behind him.

ASTRAL
Spectra (20s, Latinx woman), can you scan the area for any hostiles?

SPECTRA
On it. But be warned, our readings indicate that whatever is causing this rift might not be your typical villain.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

The team emerges from the portal, ready to face whatever lies ahead. They see a massive, swirling vortex sucking people and objects towards its center.

QUARK
Whoa... that's one big tear in reality.

ASTRAL
Quark, can you...

QUARK
...stop it? Yeah, I'll try.

Quark focuses his energy on the rift, but it only grows stronger. Spectra takes a deep breath, charging up her powers.

SPECTRA
Not again...

She unleashes a blast of light that manages to hold back the tear for mere seconds before the vortex reasserts itself.

ASTRAL
We need to think outside the box here. Symbiote (30s, Middle Eastern man), can you analyze this rift and find its source?

SYMBIOTE
Working on it...

As he studies the phenomenon, his eyes widen in alarm.

SYMBIOTE
Guys... I think we're looking at a temporal echo. Something is using the rift to bring an alternate version of our city into being.

QUARK
But why? And who's doing it?

ASTRAL
Whatever the reason, we can't let this continue. We need to close that rift and restore balance to reality.

The team exchanges determined glances before charging forward, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

We see a cheesy, low-budget TV studio set with a few worn-out couches and a makeshift stage. The host, LARRY (played by a comedic actor like Will Sasso), is standing in front of the camera, wearing a bright orange jumpsuit.

LARRY:
Welcome to... THE DUMBEST SHOW ON EARTH! I'm your host, Larry!

The camera cuts to a panel of three contestants: SARAH, a quirky artist; JASON, a wannabe rapper; and MARCUS, an over-the-top motivational speaker.

LARRY:
Today's challenge is... The Talent Hunt! Our contestants will compete in a series of ridiculous challenges to prove they have the most "talent" out there. And by "talent," we mean stuff that will embarrass us all on national television.

SARAH, JASON, and MARCUS exchange nervous glances.

LARRY:
Our first challenge is... Extreme Karaoke! Contestants must sing a song of their choice while performing an unrelated task, like juggling chainsaws or riding a unicycle.

Sarah chooses to sing "I Will Survive" while playing the harmonica with her feet. Jason decides to rap "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" while attempting to eat a bowl of spaghetti with chopsticks. Marcus selects to sing "Bohemian Rhapsody" while... wait for it... riding a unicycle.

The contestants start their performances, quickly devolving into chaos and absurdity. Larry provides play-by-play commentary, making wisecracks about the contestants' ineptitude.

LARRY:
And there's Sarah, playing that harmonica like it's a trombone! And Jason is using his chopsticks to... pick up a meatball? Is that even possible?

The camera cuts to a montage of the contestants struggling through their performances. When they're finished, Larry announces the results:

LARRY:
And the winner of Extreme Karaoke is... Marcus, who somehow managed not to fall off his unicycle while singing "Bohemian Rhapsody"!

Marcus celebrates with a triumphant dance.

The contestants are now competing in the next challenge: The Cooking Showdown. They're given a mystery ingredient, which turns out to be a can of sardines. Sarah attempts to make sardine sushi; Jason tries to deep-fry them; and Marcus decides to... eat them straight from the can.

LARRY:
And that's when things get really crazy! The contestants are now in a cooking battle, using their "talents" to create the most disgusting dishes imaginable!

The camera cuts back and forth between the contestants' disastrous cooking attempts. When they're finished, Larry announces the results:

LARRY:
And the winner of The Cooking Showdown is... Sarah, who managed to make something that almost looks like sushi!

Sarah celebrates with a relieved smile.

**INTRO**

(The camera pans over a sprawling metropolis, before zooming in on a single figure walking down a crowded street)

**FADE IN**

**Act I**

We meet our protagonist, JESSICA (28), a harried business traveler rushing to catch her flight. As she sprints through the airport terminal, we see flashes of her life: a loving relationship with an unseen partner, a high-powered job, and a seemingly perfect world.

But as Jessica's anxiety mounts, these moments begin to distort and fragment. She starts to notice strange details about the people around her: a businessman's tie seems to unravel on its own, a child's smile twists into a grotesque grimace, and a woman's eyes turn an unsettling shade of green.

Jessica's stress becomes almost palpable as she realizes she's going to miss her flight. She rushes to the gate, only to find it closed and locked. The attendant, a stone-faced woman with an otherworldly expression, informs Jessica that her flight has been canceled due to "unforeseen circumstances."

**Act II**

As Jessica navigates the labyrinthine airport terminal, she begins to lose her grip on reality. She encounters people from her past – a former colleague who now seems to be hiding secrets, a high school classmate whose body appears to be decomposing before her eyes – and every interaction becomes increasingly surreal.

Jessica's memories start to unravel as well. We see glimpses of a traumatic event from her childhood: her parents' divorce, which has left deep emotional scars. The more she tries to recall the details, the more they slip away like sand between her fingers.

The camera begins to distort and glitch, reflecting Jessica's growing disorientation. She stumbles through the airport, desperate to find her way out of this never-ending maze.

**Act III**

As Jessica nears a state of complete collapse, she encounters an enigmatic figure – an older woman with piercing blue eyes who seems to know more about Jessica than she should. The woman whispers cryptic warnings and hints at a hidden truth: the airport is not what it seems, and the people around her are merely fragments of her own fractured psyche.

The camera cuts back to the intro shot of Jessica walking down the crowded street – but this time, we see that she's still in the airport. The businessman's tie has unraveled once more, the child's smile twisted into a snarl, and the woman's eyes turned an unnatural shade of green.

Jessica's world dissolves into chaos as she realizes that she's been trapped in this dreamscape forever – lost in transit between reality and madness.

**FADE TO BLACK**

This is just one episode of "Fragmented Dreamscape," where the boundaries between truth and fantasy blur, and the line between sanity and madness becomes a mere suggestion.<end>

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

We see JASON, a lovable but slightly annoying guy in his mid-30s, sitting on the couch with his girlfriend, SARAH.

JASON
So, I was thinking...

SARAH
(sighing)
Oh boy.

JASON
No, no, hear me out. I'm telling you, the reason we're always running late is because of the time paradox.

SARAH
(confused)
Time paradox?

JASON
Yes! Think about it. If we leave on time every day, but still get stuck in traffic, that means the universe has somehow already accounted for our tardiness and adjusted our departure schedule accordingly.

SARAH
(unimpressed)
That's just an excuse.

JASON
No, no, it's science! I read about it online. The concept is called "The Grandfather Principle" or something like that.

SARAH
(skeptical)
And how exactly does this apply to our daily commute?

JASON
Well, if we had left on time every day, but still got stuck in traffic... (pauses) ...that means we would have already missed the window of opportunity where we could have left early and avoided the traffic. Which is why we always seem to be late!

SARAH
(rolling her eyes)
You're just making this up.

JASON
(defensively)
I am not! I'm using a complex mathematical formula to explain our everyday experience.

SARAH
(sarcastically)
Oh yeah? What's the formula?

JASON
(proudly)
C = t / (t - d) where C is the time it takes to get to work, t is the time we leave the house, and d is the amount of time we spend stuck in traffic.

SARAH
(unimpressed)
And what does that equation tell us?

JASON
(proudly)
It tells us... (pauses) ...that we're always going to be late!

SARAH
(laughing)
That's not science, Jason. That's just you being late all the time.

JASON
(smiling smugly)
Hey, at least I'm explaining why it's true.

FADE OUT.<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Crime streaming series. The title of the series is `City of Secrets`.<start>FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The camera pans over a bustling city street, neon lights reflecting off wet pavement. We see Detective JESSICA WALKER (35), a no-nonsense, sharp-dressed woman with a troubled past, walking towards the camera.

JESSICA
(to herself)
Another night, another case.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Jessica enters the police station, where her partner, DETECTIVE MARCUS RIVERS (40), is waiting for her.

MARCUS
Hey, Jess. Got a new one. Woman's gone missing.

JESSICA
(skeptical)
What's the story?

MARCUS
(handing her a file)
Sarah Lee. 25 years old. Last seen leaving a nightclub three nights ago.

Jessica flips through the file.

JESSICA
(reading)
No family reported missing her, no suspicious activity... What makes you think something's up?

MARCUS
(shrugs)
Just a hunch. And I got a call from the club owner. He said Sarah was acting strange that night.

CUT TO:

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Jessica and Marcus arrive at the nightclub, where they meet with the owner, VINCENT (50).

VINCENT
(nervously)
Yeah... Sarah came in here around midnight. She was with a friend, some guy named Alex. They left together.

JESSICA
(eyes narrowing)
You know their relationship?

VINCENT
(shrugs)
Just what I told you. Friends.

Jessica and Marcus exchange a look.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S CAR - NIGHT

As they drive through the city, Jessica starts to dig into Sarah's background on her phone.

JESSICA
(to herself)
Sarah Lee... 25 years old...

Suddenly, her phone buzzes with an incoming text from an unknown number: "Look closer at Alex."

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Jessica and Marcus arrive back at the station, where they begin to investigate Sarah's disappearance.

JESSICA
(to Marcus)
You know what I don't get? Why would a girl like Sarah just vanish without a word?

MARCUS
(shrugs)
Maybe she wanted to start over. Maybe...

Jessica cuts him off, her eyes locked on something across the room.

CUT TO:

INT. FILE ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica enters the file room and pulls out a folder labeled "Confidential".

JESSICA
(whispering to herself)
Oh no.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

As Jessica leaves the police station, she's followed by an unseen figure.

FADE OUT.<end>
