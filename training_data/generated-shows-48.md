CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

We meet our protagonist, JACK McCORD (40s), a ruggedly handsome outlaw with a mysterious past. He sits alone at a table, nursing a whiskey, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of caution and curiosity.

JACK
(to the bartender)
Whiskey, Sam. Make it a double.

SARAH JENKINS (30s), a beautiful and feisty saloon owner, slides Jack a bottle and a glass.

SARAH
(eyeing him warily)
That'll be five dollars, Mr...?

JACK
(smirking)
Just McCord's fine. I'm here for business.

Suddenly, the swinging doors burst open, and in walks LUCAS RYDER (40s), a ruthless cattle baron with a reputation for cruelty.

LUCAS
(to Jack)
McCord! You're a hard man to find.

JACK
(unfazed)
Ryder. What can I do for you?

LUCAS
(sneering)
You've been causing quite the stir, McCord. People are talking about your... exploits.

Jack's expression turns cold.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN - DAY

As Jack and Ryder exchange heated words outside the saloon, a young girl, EMILY (10s), watches with wide eyes from the shadows. Emily is the daughter of the town's mayor, who's been terrorized by Ryder's goons.

EMILY
(whispering to herself)
Papa says Jack McCord is the only one brave enough to stand up to Ryder...

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - LATER

Jack has just finished a tense conversation with Sarah, and now he's faced with an unexpected offer from her.

SARAH
(nervously)
I know what you're thinking, Jack. But I've got information about Ryder's operation... if you're willing to listen.

JACK
(raises an eyebrow)
What kind of information?

SARAH
(teasingly)
Oh, just some rumors and tidbits from the local ladies' gossip circle...

Jack leans in, intrigued.

EXT. TOWN - LATER

As night begins to fall, Jack sets out on his horse, accompanied by Emily's whispered thanks. He rides with a purpose, but with an unspoken hope that Sarah might be telling the truth about redemption.

Jess is now dressed in Emily's old clothes, carrying the journal as she navigates the abandoned library. She comes across a room filled with glowing books, each one containing a memory from someone's past.

JESS
(awestruck)
This is it... this is where The Eraser can't reach...

As Jess opens one of the books, we see a flashback of an old man (70s), remembering his childhood. Tears stream down his face as he reads about his late wife and their happy memories together.

CUT TO:

INT. MEMORIUM - DAY

Jess realizes that these books are the key to preserving memories, not just from Emily's time but also from those who've forgotten their own pasts. She understands her purpose: to be the new Memory Keeper.

JESS

I'll keep them safe... I won't let anyone forget...

As Jess vows to protect the library and its contents, The Eraser appears, watching her with an air of malevolence.

Suddenly, a gust of wind blows out the candles, plunging the room into darkness. Aria's eyes snap open as she senses an unwelcome presence.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWER GROUNDS - DAY

A figure emerges from the shadows: Kael, a brooding warrior with piercing blue eyes and shoulder-length silver hair. His sword, adorned with runes that glow with an otherworldly energy, shines brightly in the sunlight.

KAEL:
( gravely )
Aria, you were warned not to meddle with forces beyond your control.

ARIA:
(firm)
Kael, I was trying to understand the Aetherscape's collapse. The echoes are growing stronger... and more distorted by the minute!

KAEL
( icily )
The Shattering? That's just a myth, a cautionary tale spun by our ancestors to keep us in line.

ARIA:
(tearfully)
You don't know anything about it! My sister Elara died during the Great Unraveling... and now I'm forced to live with its echoes...

As Kael scoffs at Aria's words, the ground beneath them begins to tremble. The air shimmers as the very fabric of reality appears to tear apart.

CUT TO:

EXT. REALMS - DAY

Multiple realms are revealed: a lush jungle teeming with life; an icy tundra where frost giants stride across the frozen wasteland; and a city made of stars that twinkle like diamonds in the night sky. Each realm is bathed in its own unique light, reflecting the souls of those within.

As we explore these realms, strange creatures begin to manifest: towering elemental spirits, whispering demons, and shape-shifters who blur the lines between human and beast.

CUT TO:

INT. ARIA'S CHAMBER - DAY

The candles have reignited, illuminating a hidden journal belonging to Elara, Aria's deceased sister. The pages reveal cryptic messages that hint at an ancient conspiracy: "the Architect," a being capable of reshaping the very fabric of reality...

ARIA:
(determined)
I've got to stop this... for Elara, and for all those innocent souls trapped within the shattered realms.

Kael stands frozen, a mix of horror and awe on his face as he gazes upon the unfolding chaos beyond the tower walls. The very foundation of their world begins to shatter...

* ZEPHYR - Wind manipulation, can generate powerful gusts and whirlwinds
* TIDAL - Water control, can create massive waves or form ice structures
* STARLIGHT - Energy projection, can blast energy beams from her hands
* FURY - Enhanced strength and agility, a skilled martial artist

AURORA
Alright, team. Reports are coming in of an unknown entity wreaking havoc on the city's eastern docks.

ZEPHYR
I'll take point. My winds will keep us clear of any debris.

TIDAL
(looking up from her phone)
And I've got a water supply ready just in case.

STARLIGHT
(focused)
My energy will cut through anything that gets in our way.

FURY

The team sets off, their combined abilities making quick work of obstacles as they sprint towards the docks.

EXT. METROPOLIS DOCKS - NIGHT

A massive storm rages around a destroyed warehouse, with debris scattered everywhere. The Tempest Guardians charge in, ready to face whatever is behind this destruction.

As they approach the heart of the chaos, a figure emerges from the smoke and flames: ECHO, a being with the power to manipulate reality and create echoes of herself.

ECHO
(smirking)
You're just in time for the main event. Welcome, Tempest Guardians.

Aurora steps forward, ready to engage Echo.

AURORA
We mean to stop you, whatever this is.

Echo raises her hand, creating multiple illusions of herself, each one attacking the team from a different angle.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

The Tempest Guardians fight for their lives against Echo's illusions, with Zephyr using his winds to disorient and clear a path through the attacks. Tidal uses her water powers to extinguish flames and create a wall of protection. Starlight unleashes powerful blasts, cutting down multiple echoes at once.

Fury takes on an illusory version of himself, confused by the numerous reflections, allowing the others to gain ground.

Aurora charges forward, determined to put an end to this fight, but Echo reveals herself to be in control, using her abilities to manipulate reality and send a shockwave through the city.

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS - NIGHT

As the team struggles to keep up with Echo's powers, they realize that their efforts are causing more harm than good. Buildings crumble, cars are overturned, and civilians run for cover as the chaos spreads.

STARLIGHT

I think I can help with that...

CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS DOCKS - NIGHT

Starlight uses her powers to create an energy shield around Echo, neutralizing her abilities and stopping the chaos in its tracks.

AURORA

Fury!

FURY

Time for a team-up...

Zephyr charges forward with his winds, clearing debris from Starlight's shield. Tidal uses her powers to create a massive wave of water that knocks Echo off balance.

As the others join in, their combined strength sends Echo flying across the city, leaving behind a stunned Metropolis.

Oh my god...

She approaches one of the photos, a black-and-white picture of a young couple standing in front of this very mansion. They're smiling and embracing each other.

CUT TO:

INT. MANSION - ROOM 3 - FLASHBACK

We see a series of flashbacks, showcasing the lives of the couple in the photo: JENNY (20s) and TOM (30s). They're happy, in love, and living in this mansion. However, their relationship is plagued by Tom's increasing paranoia and erratic behavior.

JENNY

What's wrong with you?

Emily is now standing in the same room as the photographs, staring at one of them with a mixture of fear and fascination. She looks like she's been possessed by Jenny's spirit.

MAYA (V.O.)
Alex, I've got the data from the experiment. It's not good.

MARCUS
...honor-bound to protect our citizens and defend our borders. The Gauls have been a thorn in our side for far too long. I implore you, noble senators, grant me permission to lead an expeditionary force against them.

The senators confer with one another, before a stern-faced ROMAN SENATOR (40s) steps forward.

ROMAN SENATOR
Very well, Cicero. You have our blessing... but be warned: the Gauls are not to be underestimated. Take a legion of no less than 5,000 men and...

Marcus nods eagerly, as the senator hands him a parchment with his instructions.

Marcus leads his freshly assembled legion through the streets of Rome, towards their departure point at the outskirts of the city. As they arrive, we see that this is not your average Roman army. Among the seasoned veterans and recruits are a few unusual faces.

One soldier catches Marcus's eye: a burly, battle-hardened warrior named GAIUS (30s), who fought alongside him in Gaul. Another soldier is PRISCIAN (20s), an eager young recruit with a scar above his left eyebrow.

Marcus approaches them, accompanied by a stately, older officer, AURELIUS (50s).

MARCUS
Gaius! Priscian! Good to see you both here. I'm counting on your expertise in the field.

PRISCIAN
(nervously)
S-sir... Marcus...

Aurelius steps forward, his expression grave.

AURELIUS
Marcus, I must warn you: there's a dark rumor circulating among the centurions about this campaign. Some say we're not fighting for Rome at all...

MARCUS
(protectively)
What do you mean?

Aurelius glances around nervously before responding in hushed tones.

AURELIUS
Word has it that certain interests are pushing for our campaign to... divert the empire's resources towards their own ends. That we'll be marching into a bloody meat grinder with no clear objectives, only to reap its spoils for themselves...

Marcus looks stunned, but quickly regains his composure.

Ma'am, I assure you we're doing everything we can. Can you tell me more about the last time you saw your daughter?

INT. HIDEOUT - NIGHT

We see JAX (30s), a ruggedly handsome and charismatic hacker, frantically typing away on his computer. His trusted sidekick, LENA (20s), stands by his side, concern etched on her face.

LENA
(frustrated)
Jax, you're going to get us both killed! We need to get out of here!

JAX
(eyes fixed on the screen)
Just one more minute, Lena. I'm almost in...

Suddenly, JAX's computer beeps loudly. He looks up, a mixture of excitement and trepidation on his face.

CUT TO:

INT. NEW TOKYO - DAY

A holographic message from an unknown sender appears before us. It's a woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. She introduces herself as EVA.

EVA
(serious)
Jax, this is Eva, a member of the Red Hand Collective. I've received intel that your Redemption Code has been compromised.

JAX
(intense)
What do you mean? The Code is supposed to be impenetrable!

EVA
(coldly)
Someone - or something - has breached the system. You need to get out of there, now.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW TOKYO - DAY

Lena and Jax flee their hideout in a high-speed hovercar, pursued by heavily armed agents from the corrupt corporation, Oni-Kiru. The streets are chaotic as they weave through traffic.

LENA
(white-knuckled)
We need to get to the Red Hand base!

JAX
(determined)
Not without getting answers first.

CUT TO:

INT. RED HAND BASE - DAY

Eva briefs Jax and Lena on the situation. They're shown a holographic representation of the compromised Redemption Code, with tendrils of code snaking out like living vines.

EVA
(grimly)
It seems Oni-Kiru has created an AI entity designed to infiltrate and manipulate the Red Hand's systems.

JAX
(furious)
That's impossible. The Code is supposed to be self-sustaining...

LENA
(alarmed)
What does this mean for us?

EVA
(calmly)
It means you're now targets, Jax. Oni-Kiru will stop at nothing to capture and exploit your skills.

CUT TO:

As night falls, the Red Hand's base is surrounded by Oni-Kiru forces. Lena and Jax prepare for a desperate defense of their sanctuary.

We see a vast expanse of open plains, with towering clouds gathering on the horizon. We hear the sound of thunder in the distance.

CUT TO:

INT. STORM CHASERS UNITED VEHICLE - DAY

We meet our team of storm chasers, led by JACK (30s), a rugged and charismatic leader. He's joined by his sister, LUCY (20s), a young and feisty meteorologist; MARCUS (40s), a grizzled veteran of the storm chasing world; and SARAH (20s), a brilliant engineer.

JACK
(into comms device)
Alright team, we've got a system brewing out there. Let's gear up!

LUCY
(consulting her laptop)
I'm reading some intense wind shear in this system. We need to be careful.

MARCUS
(smirking)
Careful? That's not what I signed up for.

SARAH
(concerned)
Jack, I've got a problem with the truck. The fuel line is on the verge of failing...

JACK
(firmly)
We can't afford to stop now, Sarah. We need that fuel line to get us through this storm.

CUT TO:

EXT. PLAINS - DAY

The team hits the road, racing towards the heart of the storm. They're equipped with state-of-the-art gear, including a high-tech weather van.

LUCY
(into comms device)
We're approaching the eye wall... it's getting intense out here!

MARCUS
(yelling over the wind)
This is crazy! We're right in the middle of it!

SARAH
(terrified)
Jack, I don't like this...

JACK
(calmly)
Trust me, Sarah. This is what we've been training for.

Suddenly, a massive gust of wind hits the truck, sending it careening out of control.

CUT TO:

INT. STORM CHASERS UNITED VEHICLE - DAY

The team struggles to maintain their grip on the vehicle as it spins wildly across the plains.

LUCY
(white-knuckled)
This is insane!

MARCUS
(shouting)
We need to get out of here, now!

JACK
(firmly)
No way. We can't lose this opportunity.

The truck lurches violently to one side, and for a moment, we think it's all over... but Jack's quick reflexes save the day.

CUT TO:

EXT. PLAINS - DAY

As they emerge from the eye of the storm, we see the full fury of nature unleashed around them: lightning crashes down, thunder booms through the air, and powerful gusts of wind buffet the truck.

LUCY
(stunned)
We made it...

MARCUS
(sheepishly)
Told you we could do it.

SARAH
(exhaling)
That was close...

JACK
(grinning)
That's just the beginning. We've got a whole season of storms to chase.

INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

We see a team of four operatives, each with their own unique skills and gadgets. They're all dressed in black tactical gear and look like they mean business.

Lead operative, JACK (30s), looks out at the city below as he briefs his team.

JACK:
 Alright, guys. Our target is a high-profile scientist who's been working on a top-secret project for a government agency. Intel suggests she's planning to defect and reveal everything to the world.

SARAH (20s), an expert hacker, nods as she checks her phone.

SARAH:
Got it. I'll get us into the building's security system in two minutes.

TOM (30s), a former special forces operative turned mercenary, cracks his knuckles.

The team infiltrates the building through a ventilation shaft. They make their way to the meeting room where Dr. Taylor and her contact are supposed to be.

Suddenly, the room erupts into chaos as heavily armed guards storm in.

JACK:
Everyone down!

The team takes cover as they return fire. Jack neutralizes two guards with his tactical knife, while Sarah disarms another with a high-tech distraction device.

TOM:
I've got the exit.

Tom takes out one guard with a well-placed shot from a suppressed pistol. Lucy uses her explosives expertise to disable a security camera, giving them an opening.

CUT TO:

INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

The team clears the room and finds Dr. Taylor, who's been taken hostage by a group of ruthless mercenaries.

As the team makes their escape, they're ambushed by a rival group of mercenaries working for a shadowy organization known only as "The Syndicate".

Jack's team fights off the mercenaries in an intense firefight that takes them through alleys and side streets.

SARAH:

LUCY:
I've got a way out. Hold on!

Lucy sets off a smoke bomb, clearing their path as they make a break for their extraction point.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOKYO STREET - NIGHT

The team boards the helicopter as it lifts off into the night sky. Dr. Taylor is safely in hand.

JACK:
Well done, team. Let's get her to safety.

As they fly away from the city, Jack receives a mysterious message on his comms device.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (V.O.):
You've just scratched the surface of something much bigger than you can handle.

JACK
(to himself)
This is it. The case that'll make my career.

Suddenly, his secretary, SARAH (20s), walks in.

SARAH
Jack, you have a meeting with the Smiths.

Ah, great. The rich and powerful Smith family. I'm sure they'll be thrilled to see me.

Sarah hands him a folder containing the case files.

MARCUS
(calmly)
Jenny, calm down. We'll get through this.

CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The trial is underway. Jack is representing the Smith family, while the prosecution, led by the determined and ambitious DA, EMILY CHEN (30s), is trying to prove that Jenny was responsible for the death of her boyfriend.

DA CHEN
(to the jury)
Ladies and gentlemen, we have clear evidence that Ms. Smith intentionally pushed Mr. Jenkins to his death.

JACK
(calmly)
I'd like to remind the court that there's no direct evidence placing my client at the scene. Just circumstantial witnesses with questionable credibility.

CUT TO:

INT. BREAK ROOM - LATER

Jack and Emily are in a heated exchange, as they take a break from the trial.

DA CHEN
(angrily)
You're just another ambulance chaser, Ryder. Playing on people's sympathies to get them off scot-free.

JACK
(calmly)
I'm just doing my job, counselor. And it's clear that you're more interested in winning than seeking justice.

Emily looks taken aback by Jack's response.

CUT TO:

Jack is on the phone with a mysterious caller (V.O.).

MYSTERIOUS CALLER

Okay, fine.

She types out a response on her phone and then closes it. Her eyes wander around the coffee shop, taking in the couples holding hands and chatting. Jess's expression turns wistful.

CUT TO:

INT. JESS'S APARTMENT - DAY

We see a collage of photos on Jess's wall. They're all of different men she's dated over the years, each with a little caption about why they didn't work out. There's "He was too controlling", "He cheated on me", and "He couldn't handle my career ambitions". The final photo is of her current ex-boyfriend, MIKE (30).

Hi... I'm so sorry to interrupt.

Not at all! What brings you here today?

Jess explains that she's a writer trying to get inspiration for her next story and Jim offers to show her his art studio. As they walk together, Jess finds herself feeling more and more at ease with Jim.

CUT TO:

INT. JIM'S ART STUDIO - DAY

As they chat and laugh together, it becomes clear that there's a spark between them. But just as things are starting to get interesting, Jess pulls out her phone and starts typing away on her notes app.

JESS
(apologetically)
Sorry about this... I'm trying to remember what you said so I can write it down later.

Jim smiles and teases her good-naturedly about being a writer. As they continue their conversation, we see flashes of Jess's past relationships and the captions on her photos wall.

We see our protagonist, JAX (30s), a rugged and imposing figure, covered in scars and wearing a mix of leather and steel armor. He's navigating the narrow tunnel, his eyes scanning for any sign of danger.

Jax stops suddenly, his hand on the hilt of his sword.

CUT TO:

A figure emerges from the shadows. It's LYRA (20s), a skilled fighter with short, spiky hair and a scar above her left eyebrow.

LYRA

The two fighters make their way deeper into the tunnels, eventually arriving at a large underground chamber filled with rows of ancient computer terminals and holographic displays.

JAX

This is incredible.

LYRA
(nodding)
It's an old research facility. The Steel Reign project was supposed to be the key to unlocking humanity's true potential.

Jax approaches one of the terminals, where a cryptic message reads: "The awakening has begun. Prepare for protocol Omega-Seven."

CUT TO:

EXT. DUNGEONS OF OLD - DAY

As Jax and Lyra exit the facility, they're met with chaos. The sound of explosions and gunfire echoes through the tunnels.

Protocol Omega-Seven must be a failsafe. Something's gone wrong.

Lyra nods in agreement as the camera pans out to reveal a horde of heavily armed, augmented soldiers descending upon them.

JENNY: Just reviewing the case files for the Wilson murder.

Detective Lee nods as he takes a sip from his coffee cup.

DETECTIVE SARAH KWAN (28): (walking in) Hey, Jenny! I've got some news. We just got a new body.

Jenny's eyes narrow.

JENNY: What's the story?

The detectives exchange a look of concern.

DETECTIVE LEE: Sounds like our killer is getting more... creative.

CUT TO:

Alright, Sentinel's got eyes on the target. It's a rogue scientist who's been working with a powerful AI entity. We need to take him out before it gets out of control.

You don't need to know. Just remember: the echoes of eternity are getting louder, and you're running out of time.

Kaelin hesitates for a moment before trusting the stranger. Together, they make their way off-planet in an escape pod.

It was supposed to be the perfect family. The Smiths had it all: a beautiful home, loving parents, and two bright kids. But behind closed doors, something was amiss.

Emily knocks on the door, and a harried-looking woman answers.

JEN SMITH
Oh, Detective Mayfield! Thank you for coming out so quickly.

EMILY
Of course, Mrs. Smith. Can I come in?

As Emily enters the house, she's greeted by the sound of children crying in the background.

EMILY (V.O.)
The 911 call came in just after midnight. Jen Smith claimed that her husband, Tom, had attacked their 10-year-old son, Alex. But when I arrived, it seemed like no one was telling the whole truth.

Emily begins questioning Jen, who appears nervous and on edge.

EMILY
So, can you tell me what happened tonight?

Tom... he just snapped. He's been under a lot of stress lately...

EMILY
And did Tom have any reason to be stressed?

Jen glances around the room before hesitating.

EMILY
So, Mr. Smith, can you explain why your wife called 911 claiming you attacked their son?

Look, I know what it looks like, but... (pauses) You don't understand. There's been a lot going on in our marriage...

EMILY
Going on? What do you mean by that?

Tom leans forward, his eyes locked intensely on Emily.

TOM SMITH
Our son... he's not who everyone thinks he is. And if anyone finds out...

Emily raises an eyebrow, intrigued by Tom's cryptic statement.

As the investigation unfolds, Emily discovers some disturbing information about Alex Smith. She visits a local school where she speaks to one of Alex's classmates, Olivia.

OLIVIA
He was always weird. Like, even as a kid. Always watching people...

EMILY (V.O.)
And when I dug deeper, I found that Tom and Jen had been keeping secrets from the community. Their perfect facade began to crumble.

As Emily continues her investigation, she uncovers more inconsistencies in the Smith's story. She visits the local hospital where Alex is being treated for his injuries.

EMILY (V.O.)
Now, I was faced with a disturbing truth: nothing was as it seemed in this quiet suburban neighborhood...

**Epilogue:**

The episode ends with Emily walking back to her car, looking troubled by what she's discovered. She speaks to the camera as she gets into the car.

EMILY (V.O.)
Fractured trust is a fragile thing. When secrets are hidden and lies are told, it can shatter in an instant. But I'll be here, digging deeper... to uncover the truth.

The screen fades to black, leaving the audience with more questions than answers about the Smith family's dark secrets.<end>

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

We see JASON, a hapless everyman in his mid-30s, sitting on the couch with a look of exasperation on his face. His girlfriend, SARAH, enters from the kitchen.

SARAH
Hey, babe! I made your favorite lunch: a grilled cheese sandwich and... wait for it... a side of existential dread!

JASON
(sarcastically)
Oh, wow. That sounds amazing.

SARAH
(smiling proudly)
I know, right? It's like the universe is screaming at you to just enjoy this one simple pleasure before everything falls apart.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S OFFICE - DAY

Jason is on a conference call with his boss, MR. SMITH, and two coworkers, THERESA AND DENNIS.

MR. SMITH
(over the phone)
Okay, guys! Let's get down to business! We need to brainstorm some new ideas for our quarterly report.

THERESA
(speaking up)
I've got it! We can just plagiarize last quarter's report and add some random buzzwords!

DENNIS
(equally uninspired)
Yeah, or we could just pretend like this is a real job and actually do some work.

JASON
(cringing in embarrassment)
Uh, I think we should go with... um...

MR. SMITH
(interrupting)
Jason, Jason, Jason! Don't worry about it, buddy. Just wing it!

CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Jason meets up with his friend, MIKE, and they sit down at a small table.

MIKE
So, what's new with you?

JASON
(sighing)
You know... just the usual. I'm in love with Sarah, but she's driving me crazy. My boss is a jerk, and my job is soul-sucking...

MIKE
(smiling)
Sounds like a typical Tuesday to me!

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason is trying to cook dinner while simultaneously watching TV on his phone.

SARAH
(entering the kitchen)
Hey, babe! How's dinner coming along?

JASON
( panicking)
It's... um... a surprise!

SARAH
(equally panicked)
Is it edible?!

JASON
( sheepishly)
I hope so...

As they continue to cook and bicker, the scene devolves into chaos with plates shattering, utensils flying through the air, and the TV exploding on their phone.

CUT TO:

EXT. JASON'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The camera pans out as we see Jason's apartment building surrounded by a surreal landscape of wacky characters, including a mariachi band, a clown juggling chainsaws, and a group of hipsters playing hacky sack.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED CARNIVAL - NIGHT

We see a rickety, old Ferris wheel creaking in the wind. The once-vibrant colors have faded to a dull sheen.

CUT TO:

INT. A BEAT-UP FOOD TRUCK - NIGHT

JESS (28), a quirky and introverted food truck owner, is huddled on her phone, typing away furiously.

JESS
(whispering into the phone)
I know it sounds crazy, but I have to see him again... Please, just for one more night...

Suddenly, the door to the truck bursts open. In walks LUCAS (30), a charming and mysterious stranger who seems out of place in this rundown carnival.

LUCAS
(smiling)
Hey, Jess. Still got that killer chili recipe?

Jess looks up, startled, and tries to compose herself.

JESS
(nervously)
Lucas... What are you doing here? You said you were going to leave town for good.

LUCAS
(sitting down across from her)
Things didn't go as planned in the city. I needed a place to crash. And this carnival's got its own charm, even if it is a little run-down.

Jess looks at him skeptically but can't help feeling drawn to his presence.

CUT TO:

INT. A DIMLY-LIT CAFÉ - NIGHT

A few hours later, Jess and Lucas are sipping coffee in a dingy café near the carnival. He tells her about his past as a journalist who uncovered dark secrets and had to flee for his life.

LUCAS
(leaning in)
But I've got one last story left in me. And this one... it's personal.

Jess is captivated by Lucas' words, and they begin to bond over their shared desire for truth and justice.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

INT. LUCAS' TRUCK - NIGHT

As the night wears on, Jess convinces Lucas to tell her more about his story. They become lost in conversation, laughing and sharing secrets like old friends.

Lucas pulls out a small notebook from his pocket, filled with cryptic notes and half-remembered memories.

LUCAS
(holding up the book)
This is all I have left of my family's history... stories passed down through generations. It's said that our ancestors were cursed, cursed to remember every painful detail of their lives like it was yesterday...

Jess looks on, intrigued.

JESS
(leaning in)
That sounds like a pretty heavy burden to carry around.

LUCAS
(smirking)
You have no idea. But I've learned to live with it... to eat away the pain, one memory at a time.

As they talk, we see flashbacks of Lucas' ancestors suffering through wars, famine, and heartbreak. Their memories are a constant reminder of their past, a heavy weight that threatens to consume them.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED CARNIVAL - NIGHT

As the night wears on, Jess and Lucas grow closer, sharing whispers and laughter under the starry sky. But as they stroll through the carnival grounds, we notice strange occurrences: a clown doll's eyes seem to follow them; a merry-go-round's horses appear to be galloping in unison.

Suddenly, Lucas' memories begin to surface in vivid detail - like a dam breaking open. We see glimpses of his ancestors reliving their traumas, over and over again.

LUCAS
(terrified)
It's happening... the Memory Eater...

Jess tries to comfort him as the carnival around them descends into chaos.

**Epilogue:**

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED CARNIVAL - DAY

The sun rises on a deserted carnival, Jess and Lucas nowhere in sight. But amidst the silence, we hear a faint whispering in the wind...

Jess' voice.
"I'll see you tonight... for just one more night..."

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. TOWN OF RED ROCK - DAY

We see a small, dusty town nestled in the middle of nowhere. A sign creaks in the wind, reading "Red Rock". People mill about, going about their daily business.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL SALOON - DAY

A group of townsfolk sit at the bar, drinking and swapping stories. The camera pans to a figure sitting alone at a table in the corner. This is JASON (30s), a former outlaw turned lawman. He's dressed in a crisp white shirt and black duster coat.

JASON
(to himself)
Red Rock, where I once rode free and wild.

Suddenly, the swinging doors burst open and in walks TOM (40s), a grizzled old outlaw. Tom's eyes scan the room, locking onto Jason.

TOM
(to the bartender)
Whiskey, and make it strong.

BARTENDER
(eyeing Tom warily)
That'll be 50 cents, mister.

Tom tosses a coin on the bar and takes a swig of whiskey.

CUT TO:

EXT. RED ROCK STREET - DAY

Jason steps outside into the sunlight, eyes fixed on Tom's back as he walks down the street. Jason approaches him.

JASON
Tom "Blackjack" McCoy. I thought you were dead.

TOM
(turning to face Jason)
You'd be surprised what can bring a man back from the grave, Jason.

Jason's hand rests on his gun, but Tom seems to sense it and nods towards the sheriff's office.

TOM
I've come for something that belongs to me. My daughter, Emily, she was taken in by the good people of Red Rock after...after I got involved with some unsavory types. I'd like to see her now.

JASON
(eyes narrowing)
You think the sheriff will let you just waltz in here and start making demands?

TOM
I don't need permission, Jason. I'm willing to make things right.

CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Jason enters the office, where Sheriff JENKINS (50s) sits at his desk.

SHERIFF
(to Jason)
What's going on out there?

JASON
Tom "Blackjack" McCoy is back in town. He wants to see his daughter.

SHERIFF
(nodding thoughtfully)
I'll talk to him. But I gotta warn you, Jason...that man has a lot of people looking for him.

CUT TO:

EXT. RED ROCK STREET - DAY

Jason walks down the street with Tom, who is flanked by two burly men. The camera follows them as they approach the sheriff's office.

JASON
(to Sheriff Jenkins)
Let us in.

SHERIFF
(nodding)
I reckon it's time we had a little chat about your past, Mr. McCoy.

The three of them step inside, leaving the tension between Jason and Tom hanging in the air.

FADE TO BLACK.
