We meet our protagonist, CAPTAIN JENNY WILSON (30s), a strong-willed and determined woman in her mid-30s, sitting by a campfire. She's a skilled pilot and commander of an all-female squadron known as the "Blue Angels."

CAPTAIN WILSON
(reading from a letter)
"...when eagles fall... it's not just their wings that break..."

She folds up the letter and looks around her tent, where other women are busy repairing damaged aircraft.

CAPTAIN WILSON (CONT'D)
(to her second-in-command, LIEUTENANT JESSICA "Jazz" MARTINEZ)
How many more can we lose?

LIEUTENANT MARTINEZ
We'll keep fighting, Captain. We won't let them take us down.

CAPTAIN WILSON
(serious)
I'm not just talking about our squadron, Jazz. I'm talking about the future. When eagles fall... it's not just their wings that break...

INT. GENERAL MASON'S OFFICE - DAY

General Mason, a seasoned veteran, is shown speaking with a young and ambitious politician, CONGRESSMAN JENKINS.

GENERAL MASON
(skeptical)
You want to merge our squadron with the regular Air Force? That's not what we signed up for...

CONGRESSMAN JENKINS
(smiling)
We're just trying to make America great again, General. This is a necessary step towards that goal.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ZEALAND HIGHLANDS - DAY

The camera pans over rolling hills and dense forests, before zooming in on a figure climbing up a steep incline. We see JASON (30s), a ruggedly handsome operative with a chiseled jawline and piercing blue eyes.

JASON
(to himself)
 Almost there...

Jason reaches the top of the hill, where he's met by his partner, MAYA (20s), a whip-smart hacker with a mischievous grin.

MAYA
Alright, Jase. I've got the location pinpointed. Our target is approximately 5 kilometers due east.

JASON

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED BUNKER - DAY

Jason and Maya infiltrate a heavily fortified bunker, avoiding security cameras and dodging gunfire from rival operatives. They make their way deeper into the complex, where they encounter a figure in a lab coat: DR. ELIOT (50s), a brilliant scientist with a manic glint in his eye.

DR. ELIOT
 Ah, welcome, Jason. I've been expecting you.

JASON
(skeptical)
What's going on here, Doc?

DR. ELIOT
(proudly)
We're working on something big. Something that will change the course of human history.

(smiling)
Project Erebus. A way to harness and control the power of the earth itself.

(smirking)
Already on it, Jase.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ZEALAND HIGHLANDS - DAY (LATER)

As they flee in a sleek black van, Jason turns to Maya with a look of concern.

JASON
(serious)
Maya, we can't let Dr. Eliot get his hands on this tech. He's going to use it for evil.

MAYA
(nodding)
I've already hacked into the system, Jase. I'm uploading a virus as we speak.

JASON
(impressed)
Good work, Maya.

Suddenly, their van is ambushed by a rival team of operatives.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ZEALAND HIGHLANDS - DAY (LATER)

As the battle rages on, Jason and Maya fight to take down their foes. They fight hand-to-hand combat, exchange gunfire, and use high-tech gadgets to even the odds.

JASON
(to Maya)
Time for a little insurance policy!

Jason pulls out a custom-made device from his backpack and activates it, unleashing a blast of energy that takes out several operatives.

MAYA
(impressed)
Nice work, Jase!

As they make their escape, Jason turns to Maya with a determined look in his eye.

JASON
(firmly)
Alright, let's get back to the States. We've got some unfinished business to take care of.

The camera pans over the city skyline, showing towering skyscrapers and bustling streets below.

CUT TO:

INT. GUARDIANS UNITED HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

We see a team of five superheroes gathered around a large table, discussing their latest mission briefing.

**MAX (LEADERSHIP AND TACTICS)**: Alright, here's the situation. Reports are coming in that a rogue scientist has been experimenting with unstable energy sources in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

**ZOE (SUPERHUMAN AGILITY AND ACROBATICS)**: Sounds like a typical Tuesday to me. Who gets to go in first?

**MAX**: I'll take point. Zoe, you're with me. We'll sweep the perimeter and clear any hostiles.

**TINO (ELEMENTAL CONTROL AND ENERGY MANIPULATION)**: And what about me? Don't I get to use my powers?

**MAX**: Tino, we don't know if there are any other civilians trapped inside or not. We need to be careful.

**TINO**: Fine. But if anyone gets hurt because of my inaction, you're the one who'll have to answer to me.

**SARAH (HEALING AND MENTORSHIP)**: (smiling) Don't worry, Tino. I'm sure it will all work out.

**MAX**: Alright, let's gear up and move out!

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The team approaches the warehouse, their eyes scanning for any signs of danger.

ZOE: (whispering) Okay, Tino. You ready to unleash some energy on me?

TINO: (smirking) You know it.

With a flick of his wrist, Tino unleashes a blast of energy that Zoe uses to propel herself into the air, clearing the entrance and landing with ease inside.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The team moves stealthily through the warehouse, searching for signs of the rogue scientist or any civilians in distress.

MAX: (spotting something) Wait... what's this?

ZOE: (examining the area) Looks like some kind of experimental equipment.

SARAH: (assessing the people trapped in cages) Oh no. They're hostages.

TINO: (summoning energy to free the captives) Time for a rescue mission!

As the team works together, using their unique powers and skills to free the captives and apprehend the rogue scientist, we see glimpses of their dynamic personalities shine through:

* MAX proves himself to be the natural leader of the group.
* ZOE's agility and quick thinking save her teammates on multiple occasions.
* TINO's energy manipulation powers prove invaluable in taking down enemy forces and freeing hostages.

Finally, with all the captives safe and the rogue scientist in custody, the team regroups outside the warehouse.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The Guardians United team shares a moment of triumph, grinning at each other.

MAX: Alright, that was a team effort if I've ever seen one.

ZOE: (smiling) Yeah, and we got it done without anyone getting hurt... thanks to Tino's energy blasts.

TINO: (laughs) Hey! I resent that!

SARAH: (laughing) It's all in good fun, guys. We make a pretty great team.

MAX: Agreed. Guardians United, assemble!

Detective Emily Taylor (30s), a sharp and determined woman, sits at her desk, staring at a file in front of her. Her partner, Detective Ryan Mitchell (40s), walks in with a concerned look on his face.

RYAN
Emily, we've got a problem.

EMILY
What is it?

RYAN
(sitting down next to her)
One of our witnesses from the Johnson case has recanted their statement. They're saying they made up everything they told us about the killer's identity.

EMILY
(outraged)
That's impossible! We had proof that...

RYAN
(interrupting)
I know, I know. But the DA is already breathing down our necks. If this witness's testimony was fabricated, we're in deep trouble.

CUT TO:

INT. WITNESS'S APARTMENT - DAY

Emily and Ryan arrive at the witness's apartment, a dingy high-rise on the outskirts of Manhattan. They knock on the door, and it's answered by JASON (30s), the recanting witness.

JASON
(nervously)
Can I help you?

EMILY
(introducing herself and Ryan)
We're detectives from the NYPD Homicide Unit. We need to talk to you about your statement regarding the Johnson case.

JASON
(backing away)
I...I don't know what you're talking about.

RYAN
(stepping forward)
Save it, Jason. We have evidence that suggests otherwise.

JASON
(defensively)
Okay, okay! I'll tell you the truth. But not here. ( Looks around nervously)

CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Emily and Ryan follow Jason to a dingy coffee shop down the street from his apartment building. Over cups of stale coffee, Jason tells them that he was coerced into making up the story about the killer's identity.

JASON
(whispering)
It was my ex-girlfriend. She wanted me to take the fall for her brother's crimes. She threatened to hurt my family if I didn't do what she said.

EMILY
(incredulous)
And you just went along with it?

JASON
(sheepishly)
I know, I know. It was stupid. But I was scared.

CUT TO:

INT. NYPD HEADQUARTERS - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY

Emily and Ryan return to the precinct, looking stunned. They brief their captain on what they've learned.

CAPTAIN
(outraged)
This is a disaster! We need to get to the bottom of this ASAP!

EMILY
(determined)
I'm on it, Captain. I'll review every shred of evidence and find out who's really behind these crimes.

CUT TO:

EXT. NYPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

As Emily and Ryan exit the building, they're met with a surprise: Emily's ex-partner from a previous case, DAVID (40s), is waiting for them outside. He looks smug and self-assured.

DAVID
(smirking)
Looks like you two have got your work cut out for you.

EMILY
(giving him a sharp look)
What are you doing here?

DAVID
(shrugging)
Just dropping by to say hello. And maybe offer my assistance...for a price.

Emily's eyes narrow as she realizes that David is up to something. She turns to Ryan, her expression urgent.

INT. FAMILY THERAPY OFFICE - DAY

We see a quirky, family therapy office filled with strange artifacts and mementos. We meet our host, DR. LUCY (played by a comedic actress like Jen Kirkman), a well-intentioned but slightly unhinged therapist.

DR. LUCY
Welcome to Family Therapy Fiascos! I'm your host, Dr. Lucy. Today we have the Johnson family here for therapy. Let's get this show on the road!

We meet the JOHNSON FAMILY: Mark (the patriarch), Karen (his wife), and their three kids, Jake, Emily, and Ben.

MARK
(sarcastically)
Great, because what we really needed was to share our deepest secrets with a bunch of strangers.

KAREN
(cringing)
Mark, honey...

DR. LUCY
Don't worry, Mark! We'll get through this together...or at least, I'll try not to fall asleep during the session.

The family begins their first session, but it quickly devolves into chaos as they start arguing and interrupting each other.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. LUCY'S OFFICE - LATER

Dr. Lucy tries to intervene, but her unorthodox methods only seem to make things worse.

DR. LUCY
Okay, let's try a trust exercise! Ben, you have to trust Mark by sharing his deepest secret with him.

BEN
(sheepishly)
Uh, okay...but I think it's pretty embarrassing...

MARK
( mock-offended)
Oh no, what is it?!

Ben hesitantly reveals that he ate the last of Mark's favorite cereal for breakfast.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - FLASHBACK

A flashback sequence shows Ben sneaking into the kitchen and devouring the cereal while Jake and Emily watch in horror.

JAKE
(dramatically)
This is why we can't have nice things!

EMILY
(sarcastically)
Yeah, because eating cereal is a crime against humanity...

CUT BACK TO:

INT. DR. LUCY'S OFFICE - CONTINUED

The family continues their session, but it only gets more and more absurd.

KAREN
(getting emotional)
I'm so tired of being the peacekeeper in this family! I just want someone to talk to!

DR. LUCY
(interrupting)
Oh no, Karen, I think you're having a breakthrough! Ben, do you have any idea what your mom is feeling right now?

BEN
(sheepishly)
Uh, she's probably thinking that I'm a monster for eating her favorite cereal...

MARK
(defensively)
Hey, it's just cereal!

The family starts to get more and more worked up as Dr. Lucy tries to "moderate" the conversation.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. LUCY'S OFFICE - FINAL SHOT

As the session wraps up, the Johnson family is still arguing, but Dr. Lucy looks pleased with herself.

DR. LUCY

The camera pans over a rundown, post-industrial complex on the outskirts of a desolate cityscape. We see JESSICA (28), a determined and resourceful young scientist, navigating through the dusty, crumbling corridors of the facility.

Jessica stops in front of a door with a sign that reads "Project Erebus - Authorized Personnel Only". She takes a deep breath, grabs her comms device, and steps inside.

The lab is in disarray, with broken equipment and scattered papers everywhere. Jessica begins to search through the chaos, calling out for anyone who might be there.

This is Dr. Jessop, responding to an urgent situation at Project Erebus. If you're there, please respond.

There's a brief pause before a voice crackles over the comms device.

VOICE ON COMMS

Jessica's eyes narrow as she turns to face a figure emerging from the shadows.

CUT TO:

INT. PROJECT EREBUS LABORATORY - LATER

A man, MAX (35), approaches Jessica cautiously. His eyes seem... off, like he's struggling to maintain focus.

MAX
Jess... I've been waiting for you.

JESSICA
(skeptical)
Waiting? What do you mean?

MAX
(clearing his throat)
The project... it didn't quite go as planned. And then... something happened. You know how the research was going, but...

Jessica's expression turns from confusion to alarm as Max trails off, struggling to remember.

CUT TO:

INT. PROJECT EREBUS LABORATORY - FLASHBACK

We see a younger Jessica and Max working together on Project Erebus, excited about their groundbreaking discoveries in quantum mechanics and memory manipulation.

JESSICA (FLASHBACK)
Max, we can create new realities within the existing one! This is huge!

MAX (FLASHBACK)

The implications are mind-blowing. We'll change the world.

Suddenly, a strange, unsettling energy emanates from their experiments.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. PROJECT EREBUS LABORATORY - PRESENT DAY

Jessica's expression turns grave as she realizes what Max is trying to tell her.

JESSICA
(whispering)
What happened? What did we do?

MAX
(hesitant)
We... we found a way to break the boundaries between realities. But it was unstable, and...

Jessica's eyes widen in horror as the truth dawns on her.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY

As Jessica processes this revelation, the camera pans out to reveal that the facility is not alone. The surrounding landscape begins to distort, like ripples on a pond.

Jessica and Max exchange a terrified glance as the world around them starts to fracture into multiple realities.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

We see a dimly lit warehouse, the only sound the creaking of old wooden beams. Suddenly, we hear footsteps, followed by the sound of someone moving furniture around.

SARAH JENKINS (28), a brilliant and feisty forensic scientist, emerges from the shadows. She's dressed in a black hoodie and jeans, her hair tied back in a ponytail. Sarah is investigating a series of high-profile art thefts in the city.

SARAH

Okay, so they've been moving the pieces to this location. I need to find out why.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Detective EMILY TAYLOR (35), a no-nonsense veteran cop, is interviewing a witness, ART DEALER JASON KWAN (40).

JASON
I swear, Emily, I don't know anything about the thefts. I just got a call to look at some new pieces.

EMILY
(skeptical)
Save it for the DA, Jason. We'll be watching you.

As Emily leaves, we see SARAH analyzing evidence in the police lab. She's found a hair sample and a piece of fabric near the warehouse.

SARAH
(to her partner, DR. HENRY LEE (50))
What've we got here? This looks like our guy's DNA.

HARRY
(looking at the results)
Not quite, Sarah. This is a match for the art dealer's son.

**Act III:**

INT. KWAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Sarah and Emily confront Jason Kwan about his son's alibi. But Jason reveals he has an airtight one... or so he thinks.

JASON
My son was with me at a charity event the night of the thefts. I have witnesses who can vouch for us.

SARAH
(skeptical)
That's convenient, Mr. Kwan. We'll need to speak with your witnesses ASAP.

As they leave, Sarah whispers to Emily:

SARAH
I think we're being played here. This guy's hiding something.

Sarah returns to the warehouse, this time with Emily and a SWAT team. They're about to catch their culprit... but things take a dark turn as they discover the true scope of the art thefts.

SARAH

Oh no...

EMILY
(alarmed)
What is it?

SARAH
This isn't just about stealing art. This is about destruction, and making a statement.

As they secure the area, we see SARAH's eyes widening in realization:

SARAH

We have multiple victims... this is not an isolated incident.

Suddenly, there's a knock on the door. Mike gets up to answer it, revealing his best friend, TOM (30s).

TOM: Yo, what's up? I brought lunch!

MIKE: (excitedly) Oh, great! You know what that means... (he gestures to the couch)

Tom sets down two sandwiches and sits down next to Mike.

TOM: So, how was your morning?

MIKE: (defensively) Hey, it wasn't bad! I did some important research on my phone. (holds up his phone)

TOM: (skeptical) Oh yeah? What kind of research?

Tom chuckles and tosses a horseshoe. It lands with a thud in the mud.

TOM: Yeah, because that's exactly what I wanted to do...

Sarah tries to kick her own horseshoe but ends up kicking it into a nearby trash can.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Mike, Tom, and Sarah are sitting at a small table, sipping their lattes.

MIKE: (sheepishly) Oh, it was... enlightening. I learned that if you eat a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in three bites, the peanut butter sticks to your teeth for exactly 17 minutes and 22 seconds.

TOM: (laughing) That's not research! That's just eating a candy bar!

MIKE: (defensively) Hey, it was science!

Tom hands Mike his phone.

TOM: Check out this tweet from the mayor of our city... "The city is experiencing a crisis of epic proportions. Please report any and all instances of incompetence to the authorities."

KAEL

The harbor? What's going on there that has them all in an uproar?

LIRIEN

No idea. But they seemed scared, Kael. Scared of what we might find if we sail into the cove.

Write a script for the single episode of a Historical Fiction streaming series. The title of the series is `The Black Rose Rebellion`.<start>**Episode 1: "The Spark"**

**Act I:**

The year is 1867, and China is on the brink of chaos. The Qing dynasty, ruled by Emperor Tongzhi, has been in power for over a century. But beneath the surface, whispers of revolution spread like wildfire.

We see our protagonist, LIU MEI (28), a young and fiery revolutionary, living in secret among the crowded streets of Shanghai. She's part of an underground movement known as the Black Rose Rebellion, fighting against the corrupt and oppressive government. Mei's days are filled with smuggling forbidden literature and spreading news of the growing resistance.

Mei meets her trusted ally, LIANG CHAO (30), a former soldier turned rebel leader. Chao is charismatic and confident, but his recklessness puts the entire movement at risk. As they discuss their plans to disrupt the upcoming Spring Festival celebrations, Mei's concerns about Chao's tactics are evident.

**Act II:**

As the festival preparations reach a fever pitch, Mei receives news that her sister, WEN HUI (20), has gone missing after being seen with government officials. Wen is involved in the rebellion, but not as deeply as Mei or Chao. Worried for her sister's safety and unsure if she's been captured or turned, Mei becomes increasingly agitated.

Chao convinces Mei to attend the festival under an assumed name, hoping to infiltrate the heavily guarded palace and possibly find Wen. As they blend in with the throngs of people celebrating, Mei keeps a watchful eye out for any sign of government agents.

Meanwhile, we're introduced to the enigmatic Governor ZHANG (45), a cunning and ambitious official with ties to the rebellion. He's rumored to be considering an alliance with the rebels, but at what cost?

**Act III:**

As the festival reaches its climax, Mei and Chao make their move. Under the cover of night, they lead a daring raid on the palace, taking advantage of the chaos and confusion. In the ensuing melee, they manage to free several imprisoned rebels, including Wen.

In the aftermath, the group discovers that Governor Zhang has been playing a double game all along. His true intentions are revealed when he hands Mei's sister over to the emperor himself – offering her as a pawn in a larger power struggle.

Mei is torn between fury and determination. She knows this betrayal means war is inevitable. As she watches her comrades flee into the night, she whispers a vow: "We will fight on, no matter what it takes."

The camera lingers on Mei's face, a burning fire of defiance fueling her eyes. This single moment in time sets off a chain reaction that will shape the course of Chinese history.

**Closing shot:**

As the Spring Festival fireworks illuminate the night sky, we see the silhouette of Mei and Chao walking into the shadows, ready to take on whatever dangers lie ahead – united in their quest for freedom and revenge.<end>

Hey, Em. You've been stuck for weeks now. Maybe it's time to take a break?

EMILY
(frustrated)
A break? I don't have time for breaks! I need to write this book!

Sarah raises an eyebrow, but Emily continues.

EMILY (CONT'D)
I just feel like there's something inside me that wants to get out. But every time I try to tap into it... nothing happens.

Sarah nods understandingly.

SARAH
You know, sometimes I think you put too much pressure on yourself.

EMILY
(skeptical)
Pressure? I just want to write the best story possible!

CUT TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

As Emily and Sarah finish their drinks, a handsome stranger walks into the coffee shop. He's carrying a guitar case and has an air of quiet confidence about him.

EMILY
(whispering)
Who is that?

SARAH
(smiling)
That's Max. A musician who plays here on occasion.

Emily can't take her eyes off Max as he sets up his guitar and begins to play a soulful melody.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

As Max finishes his song, Emily finds herself drawn to him. They exchange a brief conversation, but it's clear that there's something more between them. Max offers to walk Emily out of the coffee shop.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

As they step outside into the crisp afternoon air, Max turns to Emily and asks if she'd like to grab coffee with him sometime. Emily agrees, and as they part ways, we see a glimmer of hope in her eyes.

FADE TO BLACK.

**Unwritten Pages**

This is just the beginning of Emily's journey as she navigates love, loss, and finding her voice as a writer. Will she find inspiration with Max? And what secrets will she uncover about herself along the way?

FADE IN:

INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Emily sits at her desk, staring blankly at her laptop screen once again. But this time, something feels different. She takes a deep breath and begins to type...

FADE TO BLACK.

END OF EPISODE 1<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Mystery streaming series. The title of the series is `Raven's Peak`.<start>**Episode 1: "New Beginnings"**

FADE IN:

EXT. RAVEN'S PEAK - DAY

We see a stunning coastal town, perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The camera pans across the town, showing its quaint shops and homes.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We meet our protagonist, JESSICA "JESS" THOMPSON (30s), a determined and resourceful small-town journalist, sitting at a table with her laptop open in front of her. She's typing away on an article about the town's growing concerns over a new development project.

JESS
(to herself)
Finally getting some traction on this story...

Suddenly, her phone rings. It's her boss, MIKE.

MIKE (V.O.)
Jess, I need to see you in my office.

CUT TO:

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

Mike greets Jess with a mixture of concern and curiosity.

MIKE
Jess, we've got a new case coming in. One that requires some...discretion.

JESS
(intrigued)
What kind of case?

MIKE
(hesitant)
A local woman, Emily Wilson, has gone missing. The police are stumped. And they want us to run with the story.

Jess nods, intrigued by the challenge.

CUT TO:

EXT. WILSON RESIDENCE - DAY

We see a distraught EMILY'S HUSBAND, RYAN (30s), standing outside his home, talking to Detective KAREN (40s).

RYAN
(frustrated)
I know I've been working late a lot lately, but Emily wouldn't just up and leave without telling me. Something's not right.

KAREN
(consoling)
We're doing everything we can to find her, Ryan. We'll get to the bottom of this.

CUT TO:

INT. WILSON RESIDENCE - DAY

Jess visits the Wilson residence, where she meets Emily's best friend, SARAH (20s), who seems nervous and on edge.

SARAH
(nervously)
I don't know what happened to her. One minute she was here, the next...she just vanished.

Jess senses that Sarah is hiding something, but can't quite put her finger on it.

CUT TO:

EXT. RAVEN'S PEAK COASTLINE - DAY

As Jess walks along the coastline, taking in the breathtaking views, she starts to piece together the events leading up to Emily's disappearance.

JESS (V.O.)
I've been investigating strange occurrences around Raven's Peak. Rumors of a local gang that's been causing trouble...and whispers about an old mystery that's been silenced for far too long.

Suddenly, Jess receives a cryptic text from an unknown number: "Don't dig deeper".

Jess looks concerned, realizing that she may have stumbled into something much bigger than she initially thought.

FADE TO BLACK.

TO BE CONTINUED...<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Crime streaming series. The title of the series is `Double Cross`.<start>**Episode 1: "The Setup"**

FADE IN:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

The city streets are alive with people, taxis, and billboards. We see a figure, JACK (40s), a seasoned detective, walking down the street, looking around cautiously.

CUT TO:

INT. NYPD HOMICIDE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Jack sits at his desk, sipping coffee, staring at a file on his computer screen. His partner, SARAH (30s), a sharp and ambitious detective, enters the room.

SARAH
Jack, we got a 10-13. Body found in an alleyway near Chinatown.

JACK
(sighing)
What's the story?

SARAH
Male victim, mid-20s. Looks like a robbery gone wrong.

JACK
(making a note on his pad)
Anything unusual about the body?

SARAH
(shrugging)
No signs of struggle or forced entry. Just a single bullet wound to the chest.

Jack nods thoughtfully and begins typing away on his computer.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHINATOWN ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

We see the crime scene, with police tape surrounding the area. Jack and Sarah survey the scene, taking in every detail.

SARAH
(whispering)
Looks like a pro job.

JACK
(nodding)
Too clean. Someone's trying to cover their tracks.

CUT TO:

INT. NYPD HOMICIDE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Jack and Sarah sit at a table, analyzing the evidence. Jack's phone rings; he answers it.

JACK
(into phone)
Yeah?

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)
Detective, we got something from ballistics. The bullet that killed our victim matches a rare caliber. We're running it through the system.

Jack looks up at Sarah and nods.

CUT TO:

INT. NYPD HOMICIDE DEPARTMENT - LATER

Jack and Sarah sit in front of a whiteboard, surrounded by photographs of suspects. Jack starts writing on the board with a marker.

SARAH
(reading over his shoulder)
So we have a possible suspect, but what's the motive?

JACK
(scribbling furiously)
That's where it gets interesting. This caliber is only used by one guy in our system: Victor LaGraine.

SARAH
(raising an eyebrow)
LaGraine? Isn't he the one who's been linked to a string of high-profile robberies?

JACK
(nodding)
The same. And get this - his alibi for tonight just fell through.

Sarah looks at Jack, concern etched on her face.

FADE TO BLACK.
