FADE IN:

EXT. THE FENS - DAY

We see a vast, flat expanse of peat bogs and marshland stretching as far as the eye can see. The wind whispers through the reeds, creating an eerie melody.

CUT TO:

INT. ABY'S HOME - DAY

We meet our protagonist, ABY (25), a determined and resourceful young woman who has grown up in this unforgiving landscape. Aby is poring over a book of diagrams and blueprints, her mind racing with ideas.

ABY
(to herself)
It's been three years since the last attempt failed. I've studied the Romans' designs... if we can just get it right...

CUT TO:

EXT. THE FENS - DAY

Aby meets her friend and confidant, EADWOLD (30), a seasoned engineer who has worked on several bridge projects in the area.

EADWOLD
Listen, Aby, I know you're passionate about this... but have you considered the risks? The Fenland storms will rip any structure apart.

ABY
(determined)
We've calculated the design to withstand even the fiercest gales. We just need the funding and support...

CUT TO:

INT. WULFRED'S OFFICE - DAY

Aby meets with WULFRED, a wealthy landowner who controls much of the Fens' trade.

WULFRED
(skeptical)
I'm afraid I must prioritize my own investments, Aby. This bridge project is... unproven.

ABY
(convincing him)
But think of the possibilities! A stable crossing will open up new markets, new trade routes...

CUT TO:

EXT. THE FENS - DAY

Aby and Eadwold begin surveying the land, laying out a series of wooden stakes to mark the proposed bridge's path.

EADWOLD
(hesitant)
You know what they said about your last project?

ABY
(wryly)
That I was "trying to tame the Fenland beast"...

EADWOLD
(serious)
This time... it feels different. This time, we might just succeed.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE FENS - NIGHT

As night falls, Aby stands alone on the edge of the bridge site, the wind howling around her. She looks out at the darkness, a mix of fear and determination etched on her face.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. ABANDONED RADIO STATION - NIGHT

The camera pans over a dilapidated radio station, the words "KRLS" faded on the front entrance. We hear a distant hum of static.

CUT TO:

INT. KRLS CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

We see a lone DJ, JEN (30s), sitting in front of a bank of dusty recording equipment. She's hunched over, eyes fixed on an old cassette tape player. The room is dimly lit, with only one flickering light bulb illuminating the space.

JEN
(to herself)
Okay, let's try this again.

She flips on the cassette deck and drops in a new tape. As she waits for the music to start playing, we see flashbacks of her past:

* A happy memory of her as a child, listening to her favorite radio show with her father.
* A montage of Jen training as a DJ, determined to succeed.
* A dark moment where Jen's voice is heard, broadcasting a desperate message to an unknown listener.

The music starts playing. It's a haunting tune that sends shivers down our spines.

JEN
(singing along)
"Lost in the static... searching for a signal..."

As she sings, we see a series of strange visions:

* A ghostly figure walking through the abandoned radio station.
* A newspaper clipping about a mysterious disappearance linked to KRLS.
* A glimpse of an old broadcasting tower on the outskirts of town.

Jen continues to sing and play music, oblivious to the ominous signs around her. The static grows louder, until...

CUT TO:

EXT. KRLS CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The camera lingers on a single light bulb flickering in the control room. Suddenly, it goes dark. The static stops.

JEN
(confused)
What's going on?

She tries to restart the music, but there's only silence.

Suddenly, we hear a faint voice on the radio, whispering a message:

"...Signal... received..."

The camera cuts back to Jen, who looks terrified as she realizes...

SHE'S NOT ALONE IN THE CONTROL ROOM.

EXT. BRITISH HILLS - DAY

We see a vast, rolling landscape of hills and valleys, dotted with clusters of wooden longhouses and smoke rising from cooking fires. The year is approximately 800 BCE.

CUT TO:

INT. CERES' LONGHOUSE - DAY

We meet our protagonist, Ceres (25), a fierce and determined Celtic warrior woman, as she prepares for battle. Her hair is tied back in a ponytail, and her armor is adorned with intricate Celtic knotwork designs.

CERES
(to her sister, Epona)
I don't like it, Epona. Something feels off. The Seer's visions have been strange of late...

EPONA
(fearful)
But Ceres, the Seer says the gods are watching over us. We'll be fine.

CERES
(skeptical)
Watching over us? Ha! The gods don't care about our petty squabbles. It's just a matter of time before the other tribes start to stir...

Suddenly, a group of Ceres' warriors burst into the longhouse, looking frantic.

WARLORD BROC
(frantically)
Ceres! We've received word from the east. The mighty Keltoi are marching towards our lands!

CERES
(grim-faced)
It's as I feared. We must prepare to defend ourselves.

CUT TO:

EXT. BRITISH HILLS - DAY

As Ceres rallies her warriors, we see a rival tribe, the Keltoi, approaching in the distance. Their leader, the ruthless and cunning King Kael (35), is shown giving battle orders to his troops.

KING KAEL
(to his generals)
We'll crush these insolent Celts and claim their lands for ourselves!

CUT TO:

INT. CERES' LONGHOUSE - DAY

As tensions escalate, we see a young warrior, Fionn (20), arguing with Ceres about the best course of action.

FIONN
(idealistic)
We can't just fight! We need to find a way to unite all the tribes against our common enemy!

CERES
(firmly)
You don't understand, Fionn. The Keltoi will stop at nothing. We must defend ourselves, no matter the cost.

FIONN
(horrified)
And what about the Seer's prophecy? What if we're not fighting just for land, but for something greater?

Ceres' expression falters as she considers her younger brother's words.

FADE TO BLACK.

Write a script for the single episode of a Anthology streaming series. The title of the series is `Blackout Radio`.<start>**Episode 1: "Signal Lost"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans across a dimly lit, abandoned radio studio. Equipment lies broken and scattered around the room. We see JESS (28), a determined young woman, surveying the space with a mix of curiosity and trepidation.

Jess speaks to the camera, her voice barely above a whisper.

JESS
(voiceover)
I used to work here. At Blackout Radio. It was my job to keep the signal going, even when the world outside seemed to be falling apart.

Cut to:

A series of fragmented flashbacks, showcasing Jess's life as a radio host. We see her interviewing guests, discussing social issues, and laughing with her coworkers. The segments are interspersed with static-filled broadcast signals and eerie silence.

**Act II:**

Jess's memories take us back to the night the world changed. A mysterious event known only as "The Blackout" occurred, causing widespread chaos and destruction.

In the studio, Jess begins to experience strange visions and auditory hallucinations. She hears whispers in her earpiece, and sees ghostly apparitions flitting around the edges of her vision.

Jess's grip on reality starts to slip.

JESS
(voiceover)
I thought I was losing my mind. But then I realized... someone – or something – was trying to communicate with me.

**Act III:**

The camera cuts to a series of cryptic messages, broadcast on an old-fashioned radio transmitter. The signals are weak and distorted, but Jess is determined to decipher the code.

As she listens, the messages grow more urgent and menacing. Jess realizes that someone or something is trying to warn her about an impending catastrophe.

With growing desperation, Jess attempts to contact the outside world. She sends out a broadcast signal, hoping against hope that someone will receive it.

The episode ends with Jess waiting anxiously for a response, as the camera pans up to reveal the Blackout Radio logo – now twisted and distorted, like a warning sign from the abyss.

**Closing shot:**

Jess's face, pale and determined, stares directly into the lens. Her voice is barely audible, but her message is clear:

JESS
(voiceover)
Signal lost. But I'll keep broadcasting... until someone answers back.<end>

INT. GENIUS GARAGE - DAY

We see a cluttered, eccentric workspace filled with gadgets and gizmos. Our protagonist, JASON (30s), a lovable but slightly unhinged inventor, is tinkering with a peculiar device.

JASON
(excitedly)
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

Suddenly, his trusty sidekick, DAVE (20s), enters the room.

DAVE
Hey, genius, what's the masterpiece this time?

JASON
(proudly)
Behold, my latest creation: The Auto-Brew-Tron 3000!

Dave looks unimpressed.

DAVE
Uh-huh. And what does it do again?

JASON
It brews coffee while simultaneously making toast and giving a back massage!

Dave raises an eyebrow.

DAVE
You know that's just three separate appliances, right?

Jason's face falls.

JASON
No...no way! It's one cohesive unit!

CUT TO:

INT. GENIUS GARAGE - LATER

The Auto-Brew-Tron 3000 is set up on a table, but it promptly explodes in a shower of sparks and coffee grounds.

JASON
(panicked)
Oh no! The safety features didn't work!

DAVE
(laughing)
Yeah, because nothing says "safety" like a device that makes toast while giving a back massage.

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jason's eccentric mother, MARJORIE (50s), enters the room, looking concerned.

MARJORIE
Jason, honey, have you talked to your therapist about this "genius" thing?

JASON
(defensively)
I am a genius! I just...need to work on my execution!

Marjorie gives him a knowing look.

CUT TO:

INT. GENIUS GARAGE - LATER

Dave and Jason are trying to salvage the remains of the Auto-Brew-Tron 3000.

DAVE
(whispering)
Dude, I have an idea for your next project.

JASON
(excitedly)
What is it?!

DAVE
(smirking)
A toaster that also gives back massages...but only on Tuesdays.

Jason's eyes light up.

EXT. AFRICA - 1806

The camera pans over the vast expanse of the African savannah, before zooming in on a small group of European explorers trekking through the underbrush.

CUT TO:

INT. EXPEDITION CAMP - DAY

We see a makeshift campsite, with tents and equipment scattered about. The leader of the expedition, CAPTAIN JAMES WYNTON (40s), sits at a map-covered table, surrounded by his men.

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(consulting the map)
Alright, gentlemen. We've been traveling for weeks, and I believe we're getting close to our destination.

MRS. FOTHERGILL (30s), the expedition's cartographer, nods in agreement.
MRS. FOTHERGILL
Aye, sir. The reports from the local tribes suggest that the waterfall is just a day's march away.

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(nodding)
Excellent. We'll press on then. I want to be the first European to see this fabled waterfall.

The men nod and begin packing their gear.

CUT TO:

EXT. AFRICA - DAY

The expedition continues on, trekking through the dense jungle. The heat is sweltering, and the men are visibly fatigued.

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(consulting his pocket watch)
We should be there by sundown.

MRS. FOTHERGILL
(also consulting her own notes)
I've been reading about this waterfall, sir. It's said to be one of the most beautiful sights in Africa.

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(smiling)
And we'll see it first.

As they round a bend in the path, they come face-to-face with a massive tree blocking their way.

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(frowning)
What's this?

MRS. FOTHERGILL
(examining the tree)
It looks like...a warning sign of some sort.

Suddenly, a local tribesman emerges from behind the tree, armed and menacing.

TRIBESMAN
(in Swahili)
Leave now, strangers. This is not a place for Europeans.

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(stepping forward)
We mean no harm. We're explorers, seeking to discover this waterfall.

The tribesman sneers.
TRIBESMAN
(scoffing)
You'll never see the waterfall. It's cursed.

CUT TO:

EXT. AFRICA - DAY

As night begins to fall, the expedition members huddle around a small fire, discussing their options.

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(serious)
We can't turn back now. We have to see this for ourselves.

MRS. FOTHERGILL
(concerned)
Sir, I've been thinking...the local tribes are not always truthful about these things. What if we're walking into a trap?

CAPTAIN WYNTON
(firmly)
Then we'll be the first Europeans to walk out of one as well.

The men nod in agreement, and the camera pans up to the stars above, as the expedition presses on into the unknown.

The camera pans over a dark and rain-soaked city street, before zooming in on a figure in the distance. We see JENNY TAYLOR (30s), a determined and resourceful young woman with short brown hair and piercing green eyes.

JENNY
(whispering into her phone)
Okay, I'm here. What do you have?

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jenny slips out of the shadows and into an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. She's dressed in a black hoodie and jeans, and carries a backpack full of gadgets.

She approaches a figure in the corner of the room, revealed to be her partner, MIKE HARRIS (30s). Mike is a former hacker turned detective, with a charming smile and a hint of scruff on his face.

MIKE
Jenny, I've got something. A new case came in tonight, just as we were wrapping up.

JENNY
What's the story?

MIKE
(pulling out a laptop)
A young woman was found murdered in her apartment building earlier this evening. No signs of forced entry or struggle, but one thing is clear: she knew her killer.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

We see JENNY and MIKE walking into the precinct, where they're met by their contact, DETECTIVE SARAH HILL (40s). Sarah is a no-nonsense veteran cop with a hint of warmth in her eyes.

SARAH
Mike, I knew you'd be on this case. You two are the go-to team for...special cases.

MIKE
(winking at Jenny)
Yeah, we're like the internet's dirty little secret.

CUT TO:

INT. VICTIM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jenny and Mike investigate the crime scene, collecting evidence and questioning witnesses. As they dig deeper, they uncover a web of secrets and lies that lead them to suspect everyone involved in the victim's life.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - LATER

As they sit in their makeshift office, analyzing data on their laptops, Jenny turns to Mike with a concerned expression.

JENNY
Mike, what if we're not just looking for the killer? What if this is more than just a crime?

MIKE
(serious)
What do you mean?

JENNY
(skeptical)
I've been digging through some old cases, and I think there might be a pattern here. A pattern that suggests someone - or something - is using our city's underground as their own personal playground.

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

As the camera pans out, we see Jenny and Mike walking out of the warehouse, into the rain-soaked streets once more. They're not just detectives; they're hunters in the dark corners of the internet.

Write a script for the single episode of a Epic streaming series. The title of the series is `Shattered Miracles`.<start>**Episode 1: "Fractured Dreams"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a breathtaking landscape of mountains and valleys, before zooming in on a small village nestled between two great peaks. We see ARIA (28), a young woman with an otherworldly beauty, tending to a garden filled with exotic flowers and herbs.

Aria's voiceover begins:

"In the world of Elyria, where magic is woven into the very fabric of existence... I was born to heal."

As she speaks, we see flashes of Aria's past: her parents, revered for their abilities as Healers; her own budding powers manifesting in childhood. The camera cuts back to the present, and Aria's expression turns somber.

"I thought I'd found my place in this world... but sometimes even miracles can shatter."

Suddenly, a group of soldiers arrives at the village, seeking shelter from a devastating storm brewing on the horizon. Among them is Kael (30), a gruff but charismatic warrior with an air of mystery.

Aria's instincts warn her to distrust Kael, but she's forced to put aside her reservations as the storm intensifies and the group takes refuge in the village. As night falls, they huddle around a roaring fire, swapping stories and sharing what little food they have.

Kael shares tales of his people's ancient magic, which he claims has been lost since the cataclysmic event known only as "The Shattering". Aria is skeptical, but Kael's words ignite a spark within her. She begins to wonder if there might be more to her world than she ever imagined.

**Act II:**

As the storm rages on outside, tensions rise within the group. Factions form around Kael and Aria, with some believing the soldier is a threat, while others see him as a potential ally in their own struggles.

Aria's conflicted emotions come to a head when she discovers a cryptic message scrawled on her wall: "You're not who you think you are." Suddenly, memories from her past begin to surface – moments that have been buried beneath the weight of her responsibilities and fears.

Kael notices Aria's distress and offers his support. As they walk through the village together, he reveals a piece of ancient lore that speaks of an ancient prophecy: "The Healer's Daughter shall bring balance to Elyria".

Aria is torn between her doubts and Kael's words, but she begins to realize that there may be more to her destiny than she ever believed.

**Act III:**

As the storm finally passes, the group prepares to continue their journey. Aria finds herself at a crossroads:

She can remain in the village, bound by duty and routine, or...

...she can embark on an adventure with Kael and the soldiers, into a world of uncertainty and possibility.

Aria's voiceover concludes:

"I thought I knew my place in Elyria... but now, I'm not so sure."

The camera lingers on Aria's face as she makes her decision: to step out into the unknown, with Kael by her side.

The camera pans over a bustling metropolis, showing towering skyscrapers and busy streets. We see people from all walks of life going about their day.

CUT TO:

We see our main character, JAX (30s), a ruggedly handsome ex-special forces operative turned security consultant. He's in his office, talking to his business partner and friend, LUCY (20s).

LUCY
Jax, I've got the job details for the new security contract. It's a high-rise building downtown.

JAX
(skeptical)
Another fancy schmancy corporate client? How many times do we have to tell them to beef up their internal security?

LUCY
(smiling)
This one's different, Jax. The CEO has a reputation for being... let's say, "high maintenance."

Suddenly, Lucy's phone rings.

LUCY
(serious)
What is it?

JAX
(interrupting)
It's probably the building owner, Mr. Lee. He's always on our case about something.

Lucy answers the phone, listens for a moment, and then turns to Jax with concern etched on her face.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

The high-rise building downtown. Jax and Lucy arrive at the scene in their sleek black SUV. As they step out of the vehicle, we see chaos erupting around them.

People are running, screaming, and panicked as explosions rock the surrounding buildings. Sirens blare in the distance.

JAX
(grabbing Lucy)
What's going on?

LUCY
(shouting over the din)
I don't know! The building owner is saying it's a terrorist attack!

Jax quickly assesses the situation, taking charge and leading Lucy to safety. As they reach the building entrance, they see a group of heavily armed men storming in.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

The high-rise building's corridors are filled with people fleeing in terror. Jax and Lucy dodge and weave through the panicked crowd as they search for Mr. Lee, the CEO.

Suddenly, bullets whizz past their heads, forcing them to hit the ground. Jax quickly returns fire, taking out one of the armed men.

LUCY
(terrified)
What are you doing?!

JAX
(grinning maniacally)
I'm saving our butts!

They make a mad dash for Mr. Lee's office, dodging gunfire and leaping over debris as they go.

CUT TO:

Inside Mr. Lee's high-tech command center, Jax and Lucy find the CEO frantically coordinating with his team to evacuate the building.

JAX
(skeptical)
You knew this was coming, didn't you?

MR. LEE
(nervously)
How did you...?

LUCY
(interrupting)
We need to get out of here, now!

As they exit the command center, the building erupts in a massive explosion, sending them tumbling through the air.

**Act IV:**

CUT TO:

Jax and Lucy find themselves on the rooftop, surrounded by flames and debris. They look at each other, battered but unbroken.

LUCY
(tearfully)
That was close...

JAX
(grinning)
Just another day in this crazy town, Lucy!

The camera pans out as Jax leaps off the rooftop, Lucy clinging to him for dear life. We see a montage of chaos and destruction unfolding below them - cars overturned, buildings ablaze, people running for their lives.

As they plummet towards the ground, we see the series title "Chaos Reigns" emblazoned on screen.

Okay, so the best part of traveling is always meeting new people...

As she types, we see flashes of her writing about her adventures on the road. Suddenly, her eyes light up as she sees a handsome stranger, MIKE (30), walk into the café and take a seat across from her.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFE - DAY

Jessica can't help but notice Mike's piercing blue eyes and charming smile. She tries to play it cool, but we see her blush as their eyes meet.

JESSICA
(awkwardly)
Oh, hi...

MIKE
(smiling)
Hi! I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. You're a travel writer?

Jessica nods enthusiastically.

JESSICA
Yeah! I'm trying to write about the best train journeys in the world.

MIKE
(impressed)
No way! I love trains too! In fact, I've just booked a ticket on this very train... (he shows her his ticket) ...and I'm heading to LA!

Jessica's eyes light up with excitement.

JESSICA
That's amazing! I've always wanted to go there. What made you decide to take the train?

Mike leans in, and they start talking about their shared love of trains and travel. We see a montage of them chatting, laughing, and getting to know each other as the train station bustles around them.

CUT TO:

INT. TRAIN - DAY

Jessica and Mike are now on the train, enjoying their journey across America. They're sitting in different seats, but we see them exchanging flirtatious glances through the window.

As they chat, we learn that Jessica is running away from a painful breakup, while Mike is trying to escape his corporate job.

MIKE
(whispering)
You know, I never thought I'd say this on a train, but... (he pauses for dramatic effect) ...I think I just found my traveling companion for the next few days...

Jessica smiles shyly and nods in agreement.

The camera pans over a small, coastal town, the sound of waves crashing in the background. We see a figure, JESSICA (28), walking along the beach, looking out at sea. She's clearly troubled.

Cut to:

Jessica's therapist, DR. LEE (50s). Jessica is recounting a childhood memory: playing with her younger brother on this very beach. Dr. Lee listens intently.

JESSICA: (tearfully) I remember it like it was yesterday...but my brother says it never happened.

DR. LEE: (concerned) Can you tell me more about that?

Jessica hesitates, then continues:

JESSICA: He just tells me it's all made up. That I'm losing my mind.

Cut to:

A series of fragmented flashbacks, each one a different memory from Jessica's childhood. We see her and her brother playing games, laughing together...and also arguing.

Act II:

As the therapy session continues, we learn that Jessica's brother, ALEX (25), has gone missing three days ago. The police are searching for him, but so far, no leads.

Jessica reveals to Dr. Lee that she's been experiencing strange gaps in her memories. She remembers things from different time periods, but they're all hazy and unclear.

DR. LEE: Jessica, I think you may be suffering from a rare condition...one that affects your memory and perception of reality.

Jessica looks shocked:

JESSICA: What kind of condition?

DR. LEE: (serious) It's called Fregoli Syndrome. People with this condition see multiple personalities or identities in others. They also experience fragmented memories, like you're doing now.

Act III:

As the episode reaches its climax, we see Jessica experiencing more flashbacks, each one showing a different side of her personality. We start to question what is real and what's just a product of her imagination.

The camera follows Jessica as she searches for Alex, following clues that lead her deeper into the town's secrets.

Cut to:

A figure, REBECCA (30s), watching Jessica from afar. She seems to be hiding something, but we're not sure what.

The episode ends with a shot of Rebecca looking directly at us, her eyes cold and calculating. We're left wondering: is she connected to Alex? And what's really going on in this small coastal town?

Suddenly, the screen flickers to life. A cryptic message appears:

Mike's voice whispers in Jess's ear:

Kim is now standing at her kitchen counter, pouring herself a cup of coffee. She takes a sip, closes her eyes in appreciation, and opens them again to gaze out the window.

Kim is now in the process of making breakfast. She cracks an egg into a pan on the stovetop and begins to scramble it. As she waits for the eggs to cook, she starts checking her phone for any important notifications.

Hey, Kim! How was your Saturday?

Oh no, what happened?!

As they continue to chat, we see glimpses of their daily routines: grabbing coffee, discussing work projects, and making small talk.

A shadowy figure, DR. ELIOT (50s), standing atop a skyscraper, watching Jessica's actions on a large screen display. He nods to himself, pleased with the outcome.

ELIOT

She's performing as expected. Activate Phase One.

CUT TO:

Jessica, now surrounded by the mercenaries. She pulls out a wrist-mounted device and presses a button. A brilliant light envelops her, shielding her from the hail of bullets.

The mercenaries are momentarily blinded, allowing Jessica to take advantage of the distraction. She uses her agility to disarm and disable them, one by one.

CUT TO:

As the last mercenary falls to the ground, Jessica approaches him. He's wearing a strange tattoo on his neck - a symbol we've seen before in Dr. Eliot's lab.

The mercenary coughs up blood, weakly.

Arlys steps out of her chambers and into the forest, where she encounters a group of creatures unlike any others in this world. They are humanoid, with features that seem to blend aspects of animal and plant life.

ARLYS
(amazed)
Kaelari...

The Kaelari approach Arlys cautiously, their eyes filled with an ancient wisdom. One among them steps forward, an elderly Kaelari named AETHON.

AETHON
(with a hint of curiosity)
Arlys, daughter of Elyria... the time has come for you to remember your past and your purpose in this Realm.

ARLYS

Suddenly, the inn's door bursts open, and a commotion erupts outside. A group of city guards, led by the grizzled veteran, CAPTAIN ORION (40), charge into the inn.

CAPTAIN ORION
(to Arin)
You're the one they call the Stormsurge Prophet! We've received reports of your... abilities.

ARIN
(surprised and wary)
What do you want?

CAPTAIN ORION
(serious)
We need your help. The ocean has begun to behave strangely - tides are rising at night, storms are brewing on calm days... It's as if the sea itself is angry.

ARIN
(hesitant)
I don't know what you're talking about...

CAPTAIN ORION
(persistent)
Don't lie to me, boy. We've heard rumors of a prophecy - one that speaks of a great calamity, brought on by the Stormsurge Prophecy. You're said to be the key to stopping it.

Arin looks uncomfortable, but Captain Orion presses on.

CAPTAIN ORION
(leaning in)
Listen, Arin. I know you think you can handle yourself, but the truth is... we need you alive. We've received a warning - someone's trying to kill you. And not just anyone... but a woman with magic as dark and beautiful as the night itself.

Arin's eyes widen as he remembers a mysterious woman from his past - a figure known only as LYRA (25), who claimed to be his long-lost sister.

ARIN
(determined)
I'll listen, Captain. But if you're trying to use me for your own purposes... I won't go quietly into the night.

Jack pays the barkeep and takes a sip of his drink. He scans the room, his eyes lingering on the townsfolk before landing on a figure in the corner: SARAH, a beautiful and enigmatic woman with piercing green eyes.

SARAH
(whispering to Jack)
You're looking for someone, I reckon.

I do. But you might want to reconsider that.

Jack approaches the sheriff's office, a small and worn-down building on the outskirts of town. He enters the office, where he finds SHERIFF WYATT, a grizzled old man with a scar above his left eyebrow.

SHERIFF WYATT
(skeptical)
Can I help you?

Just looking for some information. You wouldn't happen to know anything about a bank robbery in Red Rock last week?

You're quite the legend, McCord. But you're no match for me.

Max helps Lucy gather her scattered papers while trying to apologize for the mess. As they work together, their hands touch, and a spark of electricity runs through both of them.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

As they continue to clean up, Max reveals he's an art conservator who's been working on restoring a priceless painting. Lucy's eyes light up with interest, and she shares her own passion for art.

LUCY
(excitedly)
I'm actually an artist! I was trying to meet this deadline...

MAX
(impressed)
No kidding? What kind of art do you create?

As they talk about their shared love of art, the camera pans out, capturing the chemistry between them. It's clear that Lucy and Max are meant to cross paths.

CUT TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

As the coffee shop starts to close, Max suggests he walk Lucy home since it's raining outside. They step out into the rain, laughing together as they splash through puddles.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy and Max are sitting on her couch, swapping stories and getting to know each other. The tension between them is palpable. As the evening wears on, Lucy invites Max to stay for dinner, and he accepts.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. JOKE'S COMEDY CLUB - NIGHT

We see a small, dimly lit comedy club. The sign above the door reads "Joke's On Us Comedy Club". We hear the sound of laughter and applause coming from inside.

CUT TO:

JASON (played by John Early), a struggling comedian in his mid-30s, standing at the microphone. He's wearing a faded t-shirt and jeans.

JASON
(nervously)
So, I went to the doctor the other day... (pauses for comedic effect) ...and he told me I had bad breath. I said, "Doc, that's not true! My breath is fine!" And he said, "No, it's a real stinker." (laughs awkwardly)

The audience politely laughs along with him.

CUT TO:

JASON'S MOTHER, CAROLINE (played by Laura Benanti), standing at the bar, sipping on a drink. She's in her late 50s, with a warm smile.

CAROLINE
(to the bartender)
Another cosmopolitan, please. Make it a double.

BARTENDER
(smiling)
Comin' right up, ma'am!

Caroline turns to face Jason, who's still trying to kill it at the mic.

CAROLINE
(shouting over the music)
Jason, honey! You're killing me out there!

JASON
(sarcastically)
Oh, thanks Mom. That's exactly what I'm going for.

CAROLINE
(smiling sweetly)
I mean it, dear. Your dad used to say you were a natural-born comedian. (giggles)

Jason rolls his eyes good-naturedly and continues with the set.

CUT TO:

JASON'S FATHER, AL (played by Brian Posehn), sitting in the audience, looking proud as ever.

AL
(to Jason's best friend and fellow comedian, TONY)
Tony, my boy! Your buddy Jason is a real comedian now. He's got his own comedy club!

TONY
(smiling)
Yeah, Dad... it's actually a tiny room above a pizza parlor.

Al looks crestfallen for a moment before regaining his enthusiasm.

AL
(excitedly)
Oh, that's even better! It's like the old days when I used to sneak into the comedy club and watch the pros!

CUT TO:

JASON'S BOSS, LUCY (played by Jessica Lowe), sitting in the audience with her phone out. She looks bored.

LUCY
(to Jason)
Ugh, Jason... this is terrible. You're really killing me out here. Not in a good way, either.

JASON
(sarcastically)
Oh no, not you too. Just what I needed to make my night complete.

Lucy gets up and walks out of the club, still talking on her phone.

CUT TO:

The end of Jason's set. He finishes with a bang, killing it in front of the small audience.

CAROLINE
(applauding)
Bravo, dear! You're a real comedian now!

JASON
(laughing)
Thanks, Mom... I think.

FADE OUT.

**THE END.**<end>
