We meet our protagonist, DR. EVELYN STERN (30s), a brilliant scientist working for the top-secret research facility, Valhalla Laboratories. She's surrounded by lab equipment and various gadgets.

EVELYN
(to her colleague)
Alright, Dr. Patel, I think we're ready to test the serum.

PATEL
(nervously)
Are you sure this is safe?

EVELYN
(confidently)
I've run countless simulations, Raj. We'll get the results we need.

Suddenly, a loud alarm blares through the lab, and the lights flicker. The camera pans up to reveal a massive containment breach on the other side of the room.

PATEL
(alarmed)
What's happening?

EVELYN
(quickly thinking)
We have to contain it!

Raj runs off to shut down the experiment, while Evelyn grabs a nearby fire extinguisher.

Evelyn is running through the lab, dodging debris and trying to find an exit. She finally reaches a door that leads outside.

As she steps out into the bright sunlight, we see her being confronted by a figure in a sleek black costume. This is ARKEIA (30s), our first Valkyrie Warrior.

ARKEIA
(fiercely)
You shouldn't have come here, Evelyn.

EVELYN
(backing away)
Who are you? What's going on?

ARKEIA
(smirking)
My name is Arkeia. And this city... it's mine to protect.

Arkeia charges at Evelyn, but she transforms into a powerful, armored version of herself using the serum from earlier. We see her in all her glory as she battles Arkeia.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

INT. VALHALLA LABORATORIES - LATER

Dr. Patel is being held captive by security forces, still reeling from the containment breach.

PATEL

I've been waiting three years for this moment.

CUT TO:

EXT. RED ROCK - DAY

Jason arrives at Red Rock, an abandoned mine town on the outskirts of civilization. He gets out of his truck and looks around, taking in the desolate landscape. As he's about to enter the main street, we see SARAH walking towards him, her eyes locked with Jason's.

(in a whisper)
Jason...

(whispering)
What happened to you? I thought...

SARAH
(interrupting)
I'll tell you everything, but not here. We have to get out of this place first.

As they continue walking through the mine, we see a group of rough-looking men, led by a menacing figure named TYLER (40), watching them from the shadows.

TYLER
(to his men)
It's time to take care of business.

Got it, Emily. What's the story with this case?

(skeptical)
What did you see?

**Act II:**

As the interrogation continues, it becomes clear that Jenny is hiding something.

EMILY
(getting frustrated)
Look, we know there's more to this than what you're telling us. Spill the truth or we'll take you in for obstruction of justice.

Okay... okay. I was at a party last night. And then... and then something happened.

Sheriff, we've got a body found in the woods.

JASON
(stirring)
What's the story?

LUCY
(handing him a file)
Female victim, mid-20s. No ID on her. Looks like she was running from something... or someone.

JASON

Another Jane Doe.

This one's different, Sheriff. She had a note in her pocket with the word "Echo" written on it.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The sheriff and deputy arrive at the scene, where a small group of townsfolk are gathered around the body. They nod as Jason approaches.

LUCY

Not our first murder in these woods, Lucy. But I think this one's connected to something bigger.

JASON
(distrustful)
What makes you think that?

(awkwardly)
Afternoon, Sheriff. Looking for work.

HAWK
(evenly)
You're new around here, huh? What's your business in Red Rock?

BLACKJACK

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

We see JEN (28), a frazzled and lovable young woman, sitting on the couch with her boyfriend, MIKE (30). They're in the middle of a heated conversation.

JEN
I'm telling you, I did not say it was going to be a nice day. I said it was supposed to rain.

MIKE
No, you said it was going to be a great day.

Jen rolls her eyes and throws up her hands.

JEN
Great day? You're really bringing that out of this? "Great day" is not even in the same universe as what I actually said.

Mike shrugs.

MIKE
I don't know, maybe you were just trying to be optimistic.

Jen's face turns red with frustration.

JEN
Optimistic? Are you kidding me?

Suddenly, Jen's phone rings. She answers it and starts talking to her friend, SARAH (29).

SARAH (V.O.)
...and then I said to my boss, "Can't we just talk about something else?"

Jen giggles and mouths the words "yes" to Mike.

MIKE
(smirking)
You're not arguing. You're just passionately expressing your point of view while completely dismissing mine.

JEN
(defensively)
I am too arguing! I'm arguing with you right now!

Mike chuckles.

MIKE
(laughing)
That's what makes it so great, Jen. We can go back and forth for hours without ever actually resolving anything.

Sarah chimes in from the phone.

SARAH (V.O.)
...and then my boss said...

Jen starts laughing and hangs up the phone.

JEN
(exasperated)
Sorry, Mike. I think we're going to have to agree to disagree.

Mike grins.

MIKE

That's what I love about you, Jen. You never actually lose an argument.

JEN
(laughing)
Oh no, that's the worst idea ever.

Mike's face turns serious for a moment.

MIKE
(smiling slyly)
I'm not joking, Jen. I think it could be a great podcast.

Jen raises an eyebrow.

Oh no, let's not. Let's just agree that it doesn't matter and move on.

The cowboys ride into town, tying up their horses outside a small saloon. Inside, the patrons are rowdy and loud, drinking and playing cards.

JACK

What's the word around here? Any trouble?

BARKEEP
(eyeing Jack warily)
Just the usual, McCullough. A bit of a dispute between the local ranchers and some rustlers.

JACK
(nodding)
You mean the same ones that've been taking cattle from the Harper spread?

BARKEEP
(nervously)
That's right.

Jack nods to his men, and they begin to dismount their horses outside.

The group rides up to a small ranch house, where RACHEL HARTER (20s), a beautiful young woman with a fierce determination in her eyes, greets them.

Hey, you okay? You've been gone for hours.

Tom scribbles some notes on his pad.

CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheriff KAREN SMITH (40) briefs Tom on the case.

SHERIFF
Rachel's car was found abandoned near the forest, but there's no sign of her anywhere. The only clue is a piece of paper with the phrase "Hollow Bones" scribbled on it.

Tom raises an eyebrow.

CUT TO:

EXT. PORTLAND FOREST - DAY

Tom and Emily begin their search for Rachel in the forest. As they walk, Tom shares his theory about the phrase "Hollow Bones".

TOM
(whispering)
It's a reference to the folklore of these woods. People say that if you venture too far into the forest, your mind can become "hollow", and you'll lose touch with reality.

EMILY
(skeptical)
You think Rachel's been driven mad?

Tom shrugs.

We see JAX (28), a brooding and intense young man with a scar above his left eyebrow. He's dressed in a sleek black jumpsuit, with a silver star emblem on his chest. As he gazes out at the city below, a holographic display flickers to life before him.

JAX
(to himself)
DarkStar, I've got a lock on your energy signature.

Suddenly, a swirling vortex erupts from the rooftop, and a figure emerges from its center. It's ZARA (25), a whip-smart and agile young woman with short black hair and piercing green eyes. She's dressed in a matching black jumpsuit to Jax's, but her emblem is a stylized crescent moon.

ZARA
(intently)
Jax, what's going on? I'm not reading any DarkStar energy from the city grid.

JAX
(grimly)
That's because it's not coming from the city. It's coming from... here.

Zara looks at Jax in alarm as a massive, dark energy entity begins to manifest before them. The camera zooms out as the entity grows in size and power, its tendrils snaking towards the city streets below.

INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Detective MAY (40) stares at her computer screen, trying to track down the source of a mysterious energy anomaly that's been causing chaos throughout the city. Her partner, Detective ZEPH (35), bursts in with an urgent look on his face.

INT. JESS'S APARTMENT - 2 YEARS AGO

We see a younger version of Jess, arguing with her sister, EMILY (25). Emily is angry and hurt, while Jess is trying to defend herself.

EMILY

You lied to me! You said you were working late, but you were out having fun with your friends!

Jess is now talking to Dr. Smith about her sister and their argument.

JESS
(tearfully)
It's been two years since that happened, and I still feel guilty about it. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently.

DR. SMITH
( empathetically)
You're carrying a heavy burden, Jess. Let me tell you something. Guilt is like a weight on your shoulders. It can be crushing at times. But the thing is, guilt doesn't always mean we did something wrong. Sometimes it means we're just human and made mistakes.

Jess looks up at Dr. Smith, a hint of understanding in her eyes.

CUT TO:

INT. JESS'S APARTMENT - PRESENT

We see Jess, now alone, sitting on the couch with a photo album in her hands. She flips through the pages, stopping at a picture of herself and Emily as kids. A look of sadness crosses her face as she remembers their argument.

Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. It's JASON (30s), Jess's best friend from childhood. He looks concerned.

JASON
Jess, what's going on? You've been distant for weeks.

Jess tries to brush him off, but Jason persists.

INT. ABANDONED MANSION - DAY

We see a grand, yet decaying mansion. Cobwebs cover the chandeliers, and dust coats every surface. Our protagonist, EMILY (30s), cautiously enters the foyer, her eyes scanning for any signs of life.

EMILY
(whispering to herself)
I should be careful. The locals warned me about this place...

As she explores the mansion, we see flashbacks of a family living here decades ago. We witness moments of joy and tragedy: a child's birthday party, a couple's argument, and a young girl crying in her room.

**Act II:**

EMILY
(voiceover)
This was once the home of the revered Memory Keeper, Mr. Jenkins. He was said to have possessed an uncanny ability to recall every moment of his life... and those around him.

We see a younger MR. JENKINS (20s), intensely focusing on a photograph. He's attempting to recall every detail about his wife, who passed away suddenly.

I remember the way she smelled... the taste of her lips...

Suddenly, we're transported back to Emily in the present day.

EMILY
(back in the mansion)
I'm starting to feel it too...

Emily begins to experience strange visions and memories that aren't hers. She's overwhelmed by the weight of Mr. Jenkins' gift, which has been dormant for decades.

**Act IV:**

As Emily struggles to control her newfound abilities, we're shown fragmented scenes from the past and present:

- A child is playing in a park, but Emily remembers it as a place where she was bullied.
- A couple is celebrating their anniversary, yet Emily sees it as a moment of desperation.

Sophia and her team find themselves in a temporary safe room within the laboratory. They're confronted by a representative from the research facility's parent company, DR. ERIC JENKINS (50s).

ERIC

Ah, Doctor Patel. I see you've discovered our little secret.

SOPHIA
(furious)
What do you mean? What was this experiment?

ERIC
(hesitant)
Let's just say it... complicated things. Echo-1 is a new form of energy source. One that could revolutionize the world.

Sophia looks at Eric incredulously, then turns to her team.

SOPHIA
(firmly)
We need to get to the bottom of this. Jason, I want you to hack into the facility's mainframe and see if we can retrieve any data on Echo-1. Emma, start scanning for any anomalies in the energy signatures. And Tom... try to contact HQ.

The team springs into action as Sophia turns back to Eric.

SOPHIA
(sternly)
And what exactly do you plan on doing about this?

ERIC
(coldly)
We'll handle it. But I'm afraid you're not going anywhere, Doctor Patel.

As they assemble before Eira, Kael reappears - this time in his true form: a towering figure with skin like polished obsidian and eyes that burn with an inner fire.

KAEL
(bowing)
The balance is shifting...and you, Eira, are at the heart of it all.

EIRA
(awestruck)
What do you mean?

KAEL
(smiling enigmatically)
You'll soon discover...the Realmwalkers Unbound have been awakened.

EXT. ROSEWOOD MANOR - DAY

We see a grand, old mansion perched on top of a hill, overlooking the small town of Ravenswood. The camera pans across the property as we hear the sound of leaves rustling in the wind.

CUT TO:

INT. ROSEWOOD MANOR - DAY

We meet our protagonist, JESSICA "JESS" WILSON (30s), a determined and sharp-witted detective from the city who has returned to her hometown to investigate a mysterious death. Jess is introduced by her aunt, LUCY (50s), a kind-hearted and feisty woman who owns a local bakery.

LUCY
Jess, dear, I'm so glad you're here. It's been too long since we've had some real excitement in Ravenswood.

JESS
(smiling wryly)
You mean the kind that involves murder and scandal?

LUCY
(laughing)
Well, when you put it that way...

CUT TO:

INT. ROSEWOOD MANOR - LIBRARY - DAY

Jess meets with JAMES (40s), the charming but troubled heir to the Rosewood estate. James is clearly shaken by his grandmother's recent passing and is struggling to come to terms with her will.

JESS
I'm afraid I have some bad news, James. Your grandmother left behind a rather... complicated legacy.

JAMES
(nervously)
What do you mean?

JESS
(smiling sympathetically)
Well, it seems Rosewood Manor has been left to a surprise beneficiary - one Emily Wilson.

James's eyes widen in shock as Jess reveals that Emily is actually Jessica's long-lost cousin, thought to be dead for years.

CUT TO:

INT. ROSEWOOD MANOR - STUDY - DAY

Jess interviews various family members and staff, all of whom seem to have motives for the murder. There's James's sister, CATHERINE (20s), a spoiled rich girl with a history of reckless behavior; JASON (30s), James's brother-in-law, who stands to gain control of the Rosewood estate if Emily doesn't show up; and MRS. WHITE (60s), the long-time housekeeper who seems to know more than she's letting on.

As Jess digs deeper into the case, she uncovers a web of secrets and lies that lead her to suspect everyone involved.

CUT TO:

INT. ROSEWOOD MANOR - NIGHT

Jess receives an unexpected visit from Emily herself, who reveals a shocking truth about their family's past and the reason for Rosewood Manor's dark legacy.

EMILY
(whispering)
Jessica, I'm not just any ordinary cousin. I'm your twin sister... separated at birth.

The episode ends with Jess reeling from this revelation as she looks out over the moonlit grounds of Rosewood Manor, the mystery only deepening.

FADE IN:

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

We see a stunning view of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, with the sun shining down on the city below. We zoom in to a small café, where we meet our protagonist, Detective JESSICA REYES (35), sipping coffee and checking her phone.

JESSICA
(to herself)
Okay, what's next?

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Jessica is at the police station, meeting with her partner, DETECTIVE TOM HARRIS (40). Tom is a seasoned cop with a kind face.

TOM
Jessica, we got another one. Rich businessman found dead in his mansion on the outskirts of the city.

JESSICA
(skeptical)
What's the connection?

TOM
(hesitant)
The victim was involved with the wealthy and influential family, the Langfords. They're known for their ruthless business tactics...and their connections to organized crime.

Jessica raises an eyebrow.

CUT TO:

EXT. LANGLEY MANSION - DAY

We see a beautiful mansion on the hillside, surrounded by a high wall. Jessica and Tom arrive at the scene, where they meet the lead investigator, DETECTIVE MIKE DAVENPORT (45).

MIKE
(to Jessica)
This is going to be a tough one. The victim was found with no signs of forced entry or struggle. It looks like a perfect crime.

Jessica nods thoughtfully as she surveys the area.

CUT TO:

INT. LANGLEY MANSION - DAY

Jessica, Tom, and Mike are interviewing the victim's family members and staff. They meet SARAH LANGLEY (28), the victim's wife, who seems shaken but composed.

SARAH
( to Jessica)
I didn't see or hear anything unusual that night. I went to bed around 10 pm.

Jessica takes note of the alibi.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Jessica is back at the police station, reviewing the case files and interviewing witnesses. She becomes suspicious about Sarah's alibi and decides to dig deeper.

JESSICA
(to herself)
There has to be more to this story than meets the eye.

CUT TO:

EXT. LANGLEY MANSION - NIGHT

Jessica sneaks back into the mansion, searching for clues. She discovers a hidden safe in the victim's study and finds a cryptic message inside.

JESSICA

FADE IN:

EXT. LONE STAR TOWN - DAY

We see a small, dusty town nestled in the heart of the Lone Star territory. Horse-drawn carriages and wooden sidewalks line the main street.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

We meet our two lead characters: JACK "HAWK" McCORD (40s), a rugged and weathered lawman with a no-nonsense attitude, played by an actor like Josh Duhamel; and LUCAS SMITH (30s), a young and ambitious deputy, played by an actor like Noah Centineo. They sit at the bar, sipping whiskey and talking in hushed tones.

HAWK
(leaning in)
You know, Lucas, sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. The violence, the politics... is this really what we signed up for?

LUCAS
(looking around cautiously)
What are you talkin' about, Hawk? This town needs us. We're keepers of order.

HAWK
(skeptical)
Order? You mean like when we let a known outlaw go free because his brother-in-law is a local politician?

Lucas shoots him a look.

CUT TO:

EXT. LONE STAR RANCH - DAY

The camera pans across the vast, sun-scorched landscape as Hawk and Lucas ride towards a sprawling ranch on the outskirts of town.

HAWK
(to Lucas)
Alright, kid. We're here to see Cade Reynolds, the owner. He's got some information about a recent bank robbery.

LUCAS
(eyes scanning the horizon)
Looks like trouble's brewin' out here.

As they approach the ranch house, a group of rough-lookin' men emerge from nowhere and surround them.

HAWK
(drawn pistol)
Easy, boys. We mean no harm.

The leader steps forward: VICTOR "VICTORIOUS" VALLEJO (40s), played by an actor like Michael Shannon, with a menacing grin.

VALLEJO
(sneering)
You're just in time for the party, lawmen. My friend Cade's... celebratin' somethin'.

As Hawk and Lucas exchange a wary glance, Victorious steps aside to reveal a group of heavily armed men inside the ranch house. The camera zooms out to show the full scope of the trouble.

CUT TO:

INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Inside, we see Cade Reynolds (50s), played by an actor like Sam Elliott, holding court amidst his rowdy gang. Hawk and Lucas enter, their guns drawn.

HAWK
(firm)
Time to cut out, boys. This is a law enforcement matter now.

CADE REYNOLDS
(uneasy smile)
Oh, I think we can settle this... amicably.

As the standoff escalates, Victorious steps in and whispers something to Cade, who nods and calls off his men.

CUT TO:

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Hawk, Lucas, and their prisoner (one of the robbers) ride away from the ranch as the dust settles behind them.

LUCAS
(whispering)
What's goin' on here, Hawk? Victorious wasn't exactly... invited to this party.

HAWK
(steady gaze)
I think we just stumbled into something much bigger than a bank heist. I've got a feelin' our work's only just begun.

As the camera pans out to reveal the vast expanse of the Lone Star territory, Hawk turns back to Lucas with a serious expression.
