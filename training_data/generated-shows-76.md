JASON
(to himself)
Time to get back to work.

Suddenly, his comms device beeps, and he answers it.

JASON
(into comms device)
What is it, Sarah?

SARAH (V.O.)
Jason, we've got a situation. Our top agent, Samantha "Viper" Vex, has gone dark. We can't reach her.

JASON
(concerned)
What's the situation?

SARAH (V.O.)
We've received intel that Vex was investigating a high-stakes heist involving a valuable artifact known as the Starlight Serpent. It seems she got too close to the truth and was taken by the perpetrators.

JASON
(determined)
I'm on it, Sarah. Get me everything you have on this case.

Jason exits the building, looking out over the city as he takes a deep breath.

SARAH (V.O.)
Roger that, Jason. You're clear to proceed.

Jason's car screeches to a halt in front of an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. He grabs his gear and leaps out of the vehicle.

A young woman, JESSICA (28), rushes down the hallway, phone pressed to her ear.

I'm on my way, I'll be there in five minutes.

Jessica hangs up and approaches a door with a name tag that reads "Senator James".

CUT TO:

INT. SENATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Jessica bursts into the office, out of breath.

SENATOR JAMES (45)
Look at you, always on time.

JESSICA
Apologies, Senator. I got held up in traffic.

SENATOR JAMES
(smirking)
Traffic? You know I have a meeting with the President's aide in an hour. Make sure everything is perfect.

Jessica nods and begins typing away on her computer.

CUT TO:

INT. SENATOR'S OFFICE - LATER

Senator James calls Jessica over to his desk.

SENATOR JAMES
Jess, I need you to look into something for me. There's a small town in the Midwest that's been hit hard by an economic downturn. I want you to find out who's behind it and what we can do to help them.

Jessica nods and takes notes as Senator James explains his vision.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWN HALL MEETING - LATER

We see a small town, Oakdale, where residents are gathered in a packed town hall meeting. Jessica is on stage, microphone in hand.

JESSICA
...and that's why we're here today to discuss the proposed economic stimulus package.

A man from the audience, TOM (35), stands up and confronts Jessica.

TOM
You know what? We don't need your help. What we need is for people who are supposed to be working for us to actually do their jobs.

Jessica tries to intervene but Tom continues his tirade against Senator James's office.

CUT TO:

INT. SENATOR'S OFFICE - LATER

Senator James storms in, furious.

SENATOR JAMES
What happened? I've been getting calls all day from Oakdale. What did you tell them?

JESSICA
( taken aback)
Senator, Tom was just expressing the town's frustrations. We were trying to help...

SENATOR JAMES
(interrupting)
Frustrations? This is not about frustrations. It's about people who are supposed to work for me being incompetent.

Jessica looks uncomfortable as Senator James's anger boils over.

CUT TO:

INT. WASHINGTON D.C. - BAR - LATER

We see Tom, still fuming from the town hall meeting, at a bar with a mysterious figure, RYAN (40).

RYAN
...and that's when I knew I had to take matters into my own hands.

TOM
(eyes widening)
You're talking about taking down Senator James?

Ryan nods as we hear Jessica's phone ringing in the background.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jessica receives a call from an unknown number. She hesitates before answering it.

JESSICA
(into phone)
Hello?

There is no response on the other end, just static.

Suddenly, the TV behind her flickers to life and we see a breaking news headline: "Senator James Embroiled in Corruption Scandal".

JEN
(smiling brightly)
Hey guys! Breakfast is ready!

CAROL
(sarcastically)
Oh joy, pancakes.

RON
(teasingly)
Come on Carol, it's not that bad. Jen made 'em with love.

CAROL
(drolly)
Yeah, I'm sure the love was infused into every single pancake.

Jen shoots her mom a knowing glance, but says nothing. She sets down a stack of pancakes and takes a seat at the table.

CUT TO:

INT. JEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

We see a messy bedroom, with clothes scattered all over the floor. Jen's phone rings, and she answers it to find out that her best friend, MIKE (30s), is getting married in three weeks. Jen is shocked and excited for Mike.

JEN

Oh my god! Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!

The family is discussing Mike's engagement and potential wedding plans. Carol mentions that she had always wanted to help plan a wedding for her child, but now it's too late.

We see JESSICA WYNTER (28), a talented singer-songwriter, sitting at her desk, scribbling lyrics in a notebook. Her manager, RYAN THOMPSON (35), enters the room.

RYAN
Jessica, we need to talk about the upcoming Starlight Serenade festival. The organizers are offering us a spot on stage, but they want us to perform an original song for the crowd of thousands.

JESSICA
(hesitant)
I'm not sure, Ryan. I've been working on some new material, but it's still in its infancy.

RYAN
(persistent)
Come on, Jess. This is a chance of a lifetime. And besides, you'll have to perform something original for the festival, so why not just use one of your newer songs?

Jessica nods reluctantly as Ryan hands her a folder containing the necessary paperwork and details about the festival.

CUT TO:

INT. MOONLIGHT COVE BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

We see Jessica, accompanied by her best friend, SARA JENKINS (27), and a charming local musician named LUCAS GRAY (30), enjoying a night out on the beach. They are laughing and chatting as they watch the stars twinkling above.

SARA
(teasingly)
You know, Jess, you look like you're in love with Lucas here.

JESSICA
(laughing)
Oh, shut up!

LUCAS
(smiling)
Actually, Sara's right. I've been wanting to work with Jessica on a new song for the Starlight Serenade festival.

Jessica blushes as Lucas pulls out his guitar and begins strumming a beautiful melody. They start singing in harmony, their voices blending perfectly.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOONLIGHT COVE - LATER

As they finish performing, we see a mysterious figure watching them from afar. It's MARCUS (40), a former music producer who was once known for his ruthless tactics and manipulation of artists.

MARCUS

Ah, Jessica Wynter. The new darling of the Starlight Serenade festival. I can use her talents to get back on top...

CUT TO:

INT. STARLIGHT SERENADE RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

Jessica is now recording a demo for Lucas's song, with Ryan overseeing the process.

JESSICA

Ryan, I'm starting to feel some pressure about performing at the festival. What if something goes wrong?

RYAN

Jess, we've got everything under control. We'll rehearse until you're perfect, and Marcus will make sure that everything runs smoothly on stage.

Jessica looks unconvinced as Ryan hands her a folder containing the final details about the festival.

CUT TO:

As Jessica performs on stage at the Starlight Serenade festival, we see a flash of lightning illuminating the dark sky. The crowd erupts into cheers and applause as Jessica's song comes to an end.

CUT TO:

INT. REDWOOD HIGHWAY POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

We meet our lead detective, JENNY TAYLOR (40s), a sharp and determined woman with a no-nonsense attitude. She's sitting at her desk, sipping coffee, as her partner, RYAN MURPHY (30s), enters the room.

RYAN
Jenny, we've got another one.

JENNY
(skeptical)
What's that?

RYAN
(handing her a file)
Body found on Redwood Highway. Looks like a hit-and-run victim.

JENNY
(reading the file)
Female, early 20s... any ID yet?

RYAN
(shaking his head)
Nope. But get this - there's something weird about this one. The ME says she was killed with an unusual object... can't quite put my finger on it.

Jenny raises an eyebrow as Ryan hands her a photograph of the victim's body. She studies it, her expression growing more intense by the second.

CUT TO:

EXT. REDWOOD HIGHWAY - DAY

The police are investigating the crime scene, where the body was found near a small diner called "Maeve's Cafe". Jenny and Ryan arrive on the scene, surveying the area with their team of officers.

JENNY
(to her team)
Alright, let's take a closer look. See if anyone saw anything.

As they begin to canvas the area, we see a figure lurking in the shadows - a young woman named SARAH (20s), who was a waitress at Maeve's Cafe. She looks nervous and anxious, glancing around as if she's worried someone is watching her.

CUT TO:

INT. MAEVE'S CAFE - DAY

Jenny and Ryan interview Sarah, trying to get her to open up about what happened the night of the murder.

SARAH
(nervously)
I didn't see anything... I mean, nothing suspicious.

RYAN
(skeptical)
Come on, Sarah. We're not here to bust you for something you might have done. Just tell us the truth.

Sarah hesitates, then starts to speak in a hushed tone.

SARAH
(quickly glancing around)
Okay... I did see something. A car driving by, about 10 pm... it was speeding like crazy...

JENNY
(interrupting)
Speeding? What makes you think that?

SARAH
(nervously)
Well, the passenger window was open... and there were two people inside... a guy and a girl.

RYAN
(impressed)
Now we're getting somewhere. Describe them to me.

Sarah hesitates again before speaking.

SARAH
(hesitantly)
The girl had long red hair...

Jenny's eyes snap up, as she recalls something from her own past - an old case involving a girl with the same description of red hair.

CUT TO:

INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY

As Jenny drives back to headquarters, she pulls out an old file and begins to flip through it. Ryan is sitting in the passenger seat, observing her reaction.

JENNY
(whispering)
Redwood Highway... that's where I used to live...

RYAN
(curious)
What's going on, Jenny?

Jenny glances at him, a look of determination on her face.

JENNY
(firmly)
This is not just another hit-and-run case. It's personal. This girl with the red hair... she reminds me of someone from my past...

The camera lingers on Jenny's expression as the screen fades to black.

**Act I:**

We see a shot of a grand, old-fashioned carnival entrance, complete with twinkling lights and a giant, spinning wheel. The camera pans to reveal a small, antique-style booth with a sign that reads "Madam LeRoux's Fortune Telling". A young woman, JESSICA (25), stands outside the booth, looking anxious.

Jessica approaches Madam LeRoux (60s) who is sitting behind a ornate table, shuffling cards. Jessica asks for her reading, but Madam LeRoux warns her that the cost of admission will be higher than usual tonight.

JESSICA: I don't care. Just give me something to hold onto. I've had the worst week ever.

Madam LeRoux smiles knowingly and begins the reading.

**Act II:**

As the reading progresses, Jessica becomes increasingly agitated. Madam LeRoux reveals that Jessica will make a Faustian bargain in exchange for success - but at a terrible cost. Jessica is skeptical, but Madam LeRoux shows her a vision of a bright future.

Jessica leaves the booth, seemingly convinced that she'll take advantage of the deal. However, as she walks away from the carnival, we see flashes of her life going down a dark path: she becomes more ruthless and cunning, alienating friends and loved ones in pursuit of wealth and power.

**Act III:**

As Jessica's success grows, so does the cost. We see glimpses of her making deals with shady characters, sacrificing her relationships for business gains. Madam LeRoux appears at key moments, hinting that Jessica is living up to her end of the bargain - but at what cost?

In a tense confrontation, Jessica realizes that she's lost everything truly important in her life. She demands to know why Madam LeRoux didn't warn her about the consequences.

MADAM LE RAOUX: (smiling eerily) I warned you, child. You just chose not to listen.

Jessica storms off into the night, but we see a glimpse of her reflection in a window - and she's no longer recognizable as the same person who started at the carnival booth.

**Epilogue:**

The camera pans out to reveal that Madam LeRoux is watching Jessica from the shadows. She speaks directly to the audience:

MADAM LE RAOUX: (whispering) This is The Devil's Due - when you make a pact with darkness, it will collect on its debts.

Jessica's fragmented selves try to communicate, but their words get lost in the silence between them. The mirrors seem to be reflecting their true selves back at her.

Alright, I'm in... Oh no...

Guys, we've got a problem. Whatever caused this explosion... it's not natural. It's something far more sinister.

CHAOIS
(investigating the area)
What are you talking about?

VIRTUS

The lab is filled with evidence of an experiment gone wrong. Something that could destroy entire cities.

The team exchanges worried glances as they realize the scale of the threat.

**Act III:**

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

As the Last Hope Brigade delves deeper into the laboratory, they uncover the remnants of a catastrophic experiment. A massive robotic creature, code-named "Erebus", lies motionless and smoldering in the center of the room.

Nova approaches Erebus cautiously:

NOVA
(hesitant)
Is this... what we're dealing with?

VIRTUS
(gravely serious)
Yes. This is Erebus. A creation designed to reshape the city, but it's clear they've lost control.

Suddenly, the lab begins to shake and rattle as Erebus suddenly stirs to life.

**Climax:**

The Last Hope Brigade springs into action as Erebus awakens, wreaking havoc on the laboratory.

Apex, take point! Virtus, hack the system and disable Erebus's defenses. Tempest, create a storm to keep it contained!

Oh, I did. And I'm fixin' to collect.

Suddenly, a group of rough-looking men walk into the saloon, eyeing Jason with suspicion.

That's him. The man we're lookin' for.

The men move towards Jason, who stands up, hand resting on his holstered pistol.

JASON

I reckon you boys are here about the reward. Well, let me tell you somethin'. I didn't come to this town lookin' for trouble.

LEAD MAN

Write a script for the single episode of a Drama streaming series. The title of the series is `Edge of Reason`.<start>**Episode 1: "Beneath the Surface"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a tranquil lake, the sun shining down on its glassy surface. We see JEN (28), a successful businesswoman in her late 20s, walking along the lake's edge with her partner, MIKE (30). They're holding hands and laughing as they take in the serene surroundings.

Jen: (smiling) This is my happy place.

Mike: (grinning) I'm glad you find it so peaceful. You deserve a break from the chaos of your job.

As they continue their stroll, we see flashes of Jen's high-stress corporate life. We catch glimpses of her yelling at colleagues in meetings, of her staring blankly at spreadsheets on her computer screen. It's clear that she's a Type-A personality, always striving for perfection.

**Act II:**

Cut to a flashback scene, set several years ago when Jen was a young woman struggling with anxiety and depression. We see her isolated, unable to connect with her peers or even herself. Her voiceover reveals the depth of her emotional pain:

"I felt like I was drowning in my own darkness. I couldn't breathe, couldn't think, couldn't be."

As we return to the present, Jen's partner Mike tries to comfort her as she opens up about her past struggles.

Jen: (tearfully) It's just...sometimes it feels like everything is okay on the surface, but beneath that, I'm still fighting this invisible war. And it can feel so overwhelming.

Mike: (gently) You're not alone in this fight, Jen. I'm here for you. We'll face whatever comes next together.

**Act III:**

As they continue their walk along the lake's edge, we see a figure watching them from afar. This is SARAH (35), Jen's older sister who has been estranged from her family for years. Sarah's presence seems to disrupt the tranquility of the scene, and tension builds as she approaches Mike and Jen.

Sarah: (ice-cold) If you want to keep pretending everything is fine, that's your prerogative. But I know better.

Jen: (cautiously) What do you mean?

Sarah: (eyes blazing) You think you're so successful now? So perfect? Newsflash: it's all just a facade. And beneath the surface...you have no idea what's waiting for you.

As Sarah walks away, leaving Mike and Jen stunned, we see a glimpse of what might be beneath the surface. A shadowy figure emerges from the trees behind them, suggesting that there are secrets lurking in the depths of their seemingly idyllic world.

The episode ends with a haunting shot of the lake's calm surface, but now ripples start to spread across its face, hinting at the turmoil to come.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see a small, quirky coffee shop. The walls are adorned with art made from old job postings and there's a sign that reads "The Job Interview" above the counter.

We meet our protagonist, JIM (30s), a lovable but slightly awkward guy who's sitting at a small table, sipping on a coffee. He looks frazzled as he scrolls through his phone.

JIM
(to himself)
Okay, okay... I've got this. I've nailed interviews before...

Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks LUCY (30s), a confident and charismatic woman who's clearly here for a job interview.

LUCY
(spotting Jim)
Hi!

JIM
(startled)
Oh, hi! Yeah, just... just grabbing a coffee.

LUCY
(smiling)
No worries. I'm Lucy, by the way. And you are...

I-I'm Jim... nice to meet you...

Lucy takes a seat across from Jim and they exchange awkward small talk for a bit before she gets up to order another coffee.

Jim is still sitting at the table, looking anxious as he checks his phone again. Lucy returns with two coffees in hand and sits back down.

LUCY

So, Jim... tell me a little bit about yourself...

JIM
(nervously)
Uh, well... I've been working in marketing for a few years now... I'm pretty good at... uh... stuff...

Lucy listens attentively as Jim stumbles through his answer. When he finishes, she nods thoughtfully.

LUCY
(smiling)
Okay... that's interesting.

Jim looks hopeful but also slightly terrified.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

As they continue their conversation, it becomes clear that Lucy is actually interviewing Jim for a job at the coffee shop itself. Jim is oblivious to this fact and continues to ramble on about his qualifications and experience.

Suddenly, the barista bursts out of the back room, looks frazzled and starts typing away on her phone.

BARISTA
(frantically)
Oh no... it's happening again!

LUCY
(calmly)
Don't worry, I've got this...

The camera cuts to a montage of chaos as the coffee shop descends into chaos. Drinks are spilled, pastries are thrown and the staff is running around like headless chickens.

CUT TO:

Jim looks on in horror as Lucy calmly sips her coffee and takes notes on her phone.

JIM
(panicked)
What's going on? Is this some kind of... interview?

LUCY

Yes, Jim... it is...

The camera cuts to a shot of the "interview" being held in a makeshift office set up in the back of the coffee shop. We see Lucy and another manager questioning Jim about his ability to handle chaos.

As the interview comes to an end, Jim looks frazzled but also slightly amused.

LUCY
(smiling)
Well, Jim... thanks for coming in today...

JIM
(whipping out a pen and paper from his pocket)
Yeah... no problem... so... when do I start?

Lucy raises an eyebrow as she hands Jim a flyer with the coffee shop's logo on it.

LUCY
(laughing)
Actually, you're hired!

The camera cuts to a shot of Jim doing a happy dance in the middle of the coffee shop as Lucy looks on, smiling.

We see our protagonist, JASON "DARKSTAR" WARD (30s), a brooding and intense superhero with a mysterious past. He's surrounded by holographic projections of various cities around the world, as he paces back and forth.

DARKSTAR
(to himself)
It's been 3 months since I returned from... wherever I was. And in that time, I've managed to contain the anomalies. But at what cost?

Suddenly, his comms device beeps. He answers it, revealing a holographic image of his trusted ally, LENA "ASTEROID" PATEL (20s).

ASTEROID
Jason, we have a situation in Tokyo. Reports are coming in of a massive energy signature emanating from the city's central park.

DARKSTAR

Time to put my skills to use. Where's the portal?

CUT TO:

Darkstar materializes on the outskirts of the park, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of danger. As he approaches the source of the energy signature, a massive, humanoid entity comes into view.

DARKSTAR
(through gritted teeth)
That's no anomaly. That's something much more sinister.

The creature, dubbed "KAIROS", begins to wreak havoc on the city, destroying buildings and infrastructure with ease. Darkstar leaps into action, his powers coursing through him as he battles Kairos in an epic showdown.

CUT TO:

INT. DARKSTAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

As the battle rages on outside, Darkstar's comms device beeps once more. This time, it's a message from an unknown sender.

UNKNOWN VOICE
(mysterious)
You're getting close to something you shouldn't be. Drop out of this fight and forget you ever heard my name.

Darkstar hesitates for a moment before responding.

DARKSTAR
(scoffs)
Save it for someone who cares.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOKYO CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

The battle between Darkstar and Kairos reaches its climax, with the two titans exchanging blows that shake the very foundations of the city.

As the dust settles, Darkstar stands victorious over the defeated creature.

DARKSTAR
(exhaling)
It's done.

Suddenly, a blinding flash of light envelops the area. When it fades, Kairos is gone, but in its place are fragments of the entity's body. A holographic image flickers to life above the wreckage.

ASTEROID (V.O.)
Jason, I'm reading residual energy signatures. This isn't over yet.

Darkstar turns to face the camera, his eyes piercing through the darkness as he delivers a stark warning.

DARKSTAR

The anomalies are coming back, and next time... they won't be so easy to stop.

We find ourselves in the midst of a thriving metropolis, with intricately carved buildings made from dark stone and golden accents glinting in the sunlight. People of all ages and occupations hurry about, speaking in hushed tones.

We see JAZAK (30s), a rugged yet charismatic leader, standing atop a grand balcony overlooking the city. He addresses his people, his voice carrying across the square.

JAZAK

"Come on, Aria! Show me what you're made of!"

Aria shoots him a look that leaves no doubt about her capabilities. She delivers a series of swift strikes, ending the exercise by knocking Dax off his feet.

CUT TO:

As Jazak surveys the landscape from a hilltop, we see strange markings etched into the rock faces. Elara appears beside him, her expression even more grave than before.

ELARA
"Azathoth's ancient history is full of secrets and whispers of forgotten technologies. I fear our enemies may have learned more about our people's past than we initially thought."

JAZAK
(gripping his sword tightly)
"We'll not be swayed by the whispers of old gods or lost knowledge. We are Azathoth, risen from the ashes! Today, we march toward a new dawn!"

CUT TO:

INT. REDSTONE CREEK - DAY

The group arrives at a secluded settlement, tucked away in a natural amphitheater of mountains. They're greeted by the enigmatic guardian, Lyra (40s), who's rumored to possess ancient wisdom and magical prowess.

LYRA
(eyeing Eira with an unnerving intensity)
You've arrived. I see you're not like the others.

EIRA
(curious)
Others? What do you mean?

LYRA
(waving her hand dismissively)
Never mind. You're here for the Blood Oath, I presume?

ARIN
(nodding)
That's right. We're seeking the blessing of the Crimson Covenant.

LYRA
(nodding solemnly)
Very well. The ritual is about to commence. But be warned: once you've taken the oath, there's no turning back.

CUT TO:

INT. REDSTONE CHAMBER - DAY

The group enters a subterranean chamber, lit by flickering torches and infused with an otherworldly energy. Lyra stands at the center of a large, circular platform, surrounded by six ancient artifacts that seem to pulsate with an inner fire.

LYRA
( raising her hands)
By the blood of our forebears, we invoke the Crimson Covenant! Let its power course through us, and guide us on our journey!

As Lyra speaks, the air in the chamber begins to charge with a dark, magical energy. Eira and Arin exchange nervous glances.

CUT TO:

EXT. REDSTONE PEAKS - DAY

Outside the settlement, we see a figure watching from the shadows: Kael (20s), a young man with an unsettling aura of darkness about him. He's been tracking Eira and Arin for weeks, driven by a twisted desire to claim the power of the Crimson Covenant for himself.

KAEL
(to himself)
It won't be long now. Soon, I'll have the power to remake the world in my image...

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. RAINY CITY STREET - NIGHT

The rain pours down, casting a misty veil over the city streets. We see a figure, LUCY (28), hurrying through the puddles, her umbrella blown inside out by a strong gust of wind.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Lucy rushes in, shaking the water off her jacket. She spots an empty table and heads towards it. As she sits down, she accidentally knocks over her purse, spilling its contents onto the floor.

The stranger, ETHAN (30), sitting across from her, immediately jumps up to help her gather her belongings. Their hands touch as they reach for a dropped item, sparking an electric connection between them.

LUCY
(apologetic)
Oh no, I'm so sorry...

ETHAN
(smirking)
No need to apologize. I think I needed that interruption anyway.

As they both stand up, Lucy's eyes meet Ethan's, and for a moment, they just stare at each other.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Over steaming cups of coffee, Lucy and Ethan engage in easy conversation, discovering shared interests and laughter. The camera lingers on their hands touching as they pass the sugar, heightening the chemistry between them.

LUCY
(teasing)
You're a bit of an oddball, aren't you?

ETHAN
(grinning)
Maybe a little. But only when it comes to music festivals and old movies.

As the night wears on, Lucy finds herself feeling seen and heard in a way she hasn't experienced in a long time.

CUT TO:

EXT. RAINY CITY STREET - LATER

Under the moonlight, Ethan walks Lucy home, their conversation flowing effortlessly. As they stop at her apartment building, he turns to face her.

ETHAN
(serious)
Lucy, can I see you again? Maybe tomorrow?

LUCY
(hesitant)
I don't know...I have work...

ETHAN
(smiling)
Then maybe I'll just have to convince you to take a day off.

The camera zooms in on their faces as they share a tender, moonlit kiss under the rain-soaked night sky.
