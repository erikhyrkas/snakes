Write a slice-of-life story about Margaret, Jared, and Tracy discussing West Virginia at a train station.<start>Margaret, Jared, and Tracy stood together at the train station. They had just missed their train by a few minutes.

"I'm so sorry," Margaret said, looking at her watch. "I thought we had more time."

"It's okay," Jared said. "We can catch the next one in an hour. Let's get some coffee while we wait."

Tracy nodded and they walked to the caf√© on the platform. As they waited for their coffee, Margaret started talking.

"I've been thinking about West Virginia lately," she said.

Jared raised an eyebrow. "Oh yeah? What's up?"

"Well, I was reading about the state in school last year," Margaret explained. "Did you know that it's the only state with a coal mine on every mountain range?"

Tracy leaned in. "That sounds cool."

"It is!" Margaret said. "And have you guys ever heard of the New River Gorge Bridge? It's this huge steel bridge over a gorge, and people go bungee jumping off it!"

Jared grinned. "No way! I've seen pictures of that before. It looks crazy."

"I know, right?" Margaret said. "I would love to visit there someday."

The coffee machine beeped, signaling that their drinks were ready. The friends grabbed their cups and took a sip as they continued talking.

"You should totally take me with you if you ever go," Tracy said, smiling at Margaret.

"Definitely!" Margaret replied. "It'll be an adventure for sure."

As they sipped their coffee and chatted on, the platform became busier with people waiting for the next train. The group stood together, enjoying each other's company and discussing more about West Virginia.

Write a slice-of-life story about Bert and Tasha discussing Indonesia at a wedding reception.<start>Bert and Tasha sat at their table, eating and chatting with other guests at the wedding reception. They were both smiling and enjoying themselves.

"I've always wanted to visit Indonesia," Bert said, taking a bite of his cake. "I've heard it's a beautiful country."

"Really?" Tasha asked, her eyes lighting up with interest. "What do you want to see there?"

"Well, I'd love to visit the temples in Bali," Bert replied. "I've seen pictures and they look amazing. And then there's the orangutans... who wouldn't want to see those?"

Tasha laughed. "You're a true nature lover, aren't you?" She paused for a moment. "We could take a boat ride on Lake Toba too. I've heard that's breathtakingly beautiful."

Bert nodded enthusiastically. "That sounds incredible! We should plan a trip there soon." He looked at his partner with excitement. "Do you think we'll be able to save up enough money for that?"

Tasha smiled and leaned in close. "We can do it, Bert. We just need to start planning now."

As they continued talking, the music started playing again and people began dancing on the dance floor. Bert and Tasha looked at each other and shrugged.

"Guess we should get back into the party," Bert said with a grin.

Tasha nodded, taking his hand in hers. "Yeah, let's go celebrate our friends' special day."

Together, they walked over to join the others dancing under the twinkling lights of the reception hall.

Write a slice-of-life story about Craig, Bentley, and Misty discussing Turkey in a grocery store aisle.<start>Craig, Bentley, and Misty stood in the grocery store aisle. They looked at the many turkeys on display.

"I'm thinking of buying a turkey for Thanksgiving," Craig said.

"That's a good idea," Bentley replied. "Turkey is always a hit."

"Yeah, it's classic," Misty added. "But have you guys ever thought about how they raise those birds?"

"Raised?" Craig asked. "What do you mean?"

"Well," Misty began, "I've read that some farms keep the turkeys in small spaces and don't let them roam free. Others might give them more space."

Bentley nodded. "That's true. I think I saw a documentary about it once. They showed how happy the birds were when they had more room to move around."

Craig looked thoughtful. "I never thought about that. Maybe we should buy organic or free-range turkey instead."

Misty smiled. "That's a great idea, Craig. It'll be better for the animals and maybe even taste better."

Bentley chuckled. "And who knows? We might just start a new tradition."

The three friends continued to browse through the turkeys on display, discussing their options.

Write a slice-of-life story about Bobbie discussing Machu Picchu in an elevator.<start>Bobbie stepped into the elevator alongside her friend, Alex. The doors closed behind them.

"Hey, how's it going?" Bobbie asked, smiling at Alex.

"It's good," Alex replied, checking his watch. "I've got a lot to do today."

The elevator began to move. Bobbie looked around the small space. There was a mirror on one side and a list of building numbers on the other.

"Hey, have you ever been to Machu Picchu?" Bobbie asked suddenly.

"No," Alex said, looking at her in surprise. "Why? Have you been?"

"Yes," Bobbie answered. "I went with my family when I was 16. It's really beautiful."

"That's awesome!" Alex exclaimed. "What was it like?"

Bobbie thought for a moment. "It was amazing. The whole city is built on this big mountain, and the views are incredible. We even saw some condors flying overhead."

"Wow," Alex said. "I've always wanted to go there. What made you want to visit Machu Picchu in the first place?"

"I'm not sure," Bobbie replied. "Maybe it was just something I'd always heard about, and I thought it would be cool to see for myself."

The elevator stopped on the 23rd floor. The doors opened with a ding.

"Hey, we're at your stop," Bobbie said, smiling at Alex.

"Yeah, thanks," Alex replied. "It was good talking to you about Machu Picchu."

"Same here," Bobbie said. She stepped out of the elevator, turning back to look at Alex. "Maybe one day I'll convince you to go with me."

Alex smiled and nodded, watching as Bobbie disappeared into the crowd.

Write a slice-of-life story about Kristi discussing North Carolina in an art gallery.<start>Kristi walked into the art gallery, looking around at the many paintings and sculptures on display. Her friend Emily was already there, standing in front of a beautiful watercolor painting of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

"Wow, this is amazing," Kristi said, approaching her friend. "I love the colors."

"Thanks!" Emily replied. "I saw it when I visited my family in North Carolina last summer. The mountains are so beautiful."

Kristi's eyes lit up. "Oh, you went to North Carolina? What was that like?"

Emily nodded enthusiastically. "It was great! My family lives near Asheville, and we spent our days exploring the surrounding countryside. We hiked through forests, visited wineries, and even took a scenic drive through the Blue Ridge Parkway."

Kristi's eyes sparkled with interest. "That sounds amazing. I've always wanted to visit North Carolina. What was your favorite part of the trip?"

Emily thought for a moment before responding. "I think my favorite part was visiting the Biltmore Estate in Asheville. It's this huge house built by George Vanderbilt back in the 1800s, and it has beautiful gardens and grounds."

Kristi's eyes widened. "That sounds incredible! I've heard of the Biltmore Estate, but I've never been there myself. Did you take a tour of the house?"

Emily nodded. "Yeah, we took a guided tour, and it was really interesting to learn about the history behind the estate. We also spent some time exploring the gardens, which were just beautiful."

As they continued to talk, Kristi couldn't help but feel a pang of envy towards Emily's experience in North Carolina. But at the same time, she was happy for her friend and excited to hear more about her adventures.

The two friends stood there for a few moments longer, admiring the watercolor painting and chatting about their shared love of art and travel.

Write a slice-of-life story about Nick, Barbara, and Forrest discussing United States at a beach.<start>Nick, Barbara, and Forrest were sitting on their towels at the beach. They were all looking out at the ocean.

"Have you guys thought about America?" Nick asked.

"What do you mean?" Barbara replied.

"I mean, the United States of America," Nick said. "It's our country."

Forrest nodded. "Yeah, I was just thinking about it too. It's a big place."

Barbara leaned forward. "I've been to New York City once. It's really crowded and noisy."

"That sounds like fun," Forrest said with a smile.

Nick started to talk. "America is all about freedom and democracy. People have the right to choose their leaders and say what they think."

Forrest nodded in agreement. "That's true. But sometimes it feels like we don't always get along, you know?"

Barbara thought for a moment before speaking up. "I think that's because America is so diverse. We're made up of people from different countries and backgrounds. It can be hard to agree on things."

Nick nodded in understanding. "But overall, I think America is a great country. There are so many amazing places to visit and experiences to have."

Forrest looked out at the ocean again. "I love living here. There's something about being by the water that feels like home."

The three friends sat there for a moment, watching the waves roll in.

"You know," Barbara said with a smile, "maybe we can start planning a trip to America's different states sometime soon."

Nick and Forrest grinned at each other.

Write a slice-of-life story about Todd and Cecil discussing Earth in a bookstore.<start>Todd and Cecil sat at a small table in the back of the bookstore. They were both looking at books, but not reading them. They were talking.

"I love living on Earth," Todd said. "It's a great planet."

"Yes," Cecil agreed. "But it has its problems too. Climate change is making big changes in our weather."

Todd nodded. "And there's also pollution from factories and cars. We have to take care of our home, you know?"

Cecil put down the book he was holding. "I like that you said 'our home'. That shows how connected we are to the Earth. Just like a family lives in a house, we live on this planet."

Todd smiled. "Exactly! And just like a family has rules to follow so everyone gets along, we need rules to protect the Earth for future generations."

Cecil leaned forward. "So, what do you think is the most important thing we can do right now?"

Todd thought for a moment. "I think reducing our use of plastic would help a lot. It's everywhere and it hurts animals who eat or get trapped in it."

Cecil nodded strongly. "That's true! And I also think we should be more careful about how much energy we use. We can turn off lights when not needed, you know?"

Todd grinned. "You're right again! Small actions like that can add up and make a big difference."

As they talked, other people in the bookstore looked over and smiled at Todd and Cecil's conversation. They seemed to be enjoying their discussion about Earth.

After a while, Todd stood up. "Well, I think we've discussed enough for today. How about we go get some coffee and keep talking?"

Cecil stood too. "Sounds good to me!"

Write a slice-of-life story about Mable and Adrianna discussing Raccoon in a daycare center.<start>Mable and Adrianna sat at a table in the daycare center. They were both wearing bright smiles.

"I saw a raccoon yesterday," said Mable. "It was eating food from a trash can."

Adrianna's eyes widened. "That's not good!" she exclaimed. "Raccoons should eat their own food, like fruits and berries."

Mable nodded. "My mom says they are smart animals. They can open latches on trash cans to get food."

Adrianna leaned in. "I want to see a raccoon again," she said. "But I hope it's not eating garbage this time."

Mable giggled. "Maybe we'll see one soon, and it will be eating fruits like you said!"

The two friends continued talking about raccoons as they played with blocks nearby.

Their teacher, Mrs. Smith, came over to them. "What are you girls talking about?" she asked.

"Raccoons," replied Mable and Adrianna in unison.

Mrs. Smith smiled. "That's a great topic! Raccoons are very interesting animals."

The three of them talked for a bit more before moving on to other activities.

Write a slice-of-life story about Graham and Terri discussing Jerusalem in a theater lobby.<start>Graham and Terri sat in the quiet theater lobby. They had just watched a movie together. Now they were discussing something else.

"Did you know that Jerusalem is a city?" Graham asked Terri. His voice was calm.

"Yes, I think so," Terri said, looking at him. "It's in Israel, right?"

"That's correct," Graham said. "But it's also claimed by the Palestinians."

Terri looked curious. "Why do they both claim it?"

Graham thought for a moment before answering. "Well, a long time ago, the Romans took over Jerusalem. Later, the Arabs came and made it their own. Then the Jews returned after being away for many years. Now there are people from different groups who live in the city."

Terri nodded slowly as she listened to Graham's words.

"I see what you mean," Terri said when Graham stopped talking. "It's all very complicated, isn't it?"

"Yes," Graham agreed. "But it's true that many people care about Jerusalem. Some think it should be for just one group of people."

Terri turned to look at the movie theater behind them. "I never thought I'd be thinking so much about a city after watching a film," she said with a smile.

Graham smiled back. "Life is full of surprises, isn't it?"

They sat there together in the lobby for a moment longer before deciding to leave the theater and go home.

Write a slice-of-life story about Bennie and Charlene discussing Monaco in a parkinglot.<start>Bennie sat next to Charlene in their car, parked in a quiet lot. They had stopped for coffee before heading home from work.

"Hey, have you ever been to Monaco?" Bennie asked, sipping his coffee.

Charlene thought for a moment. "No, I don't think so. Why? Have you been?"

"Yeah," Bennie said. "It was on a cruise with my family when I was a kid. We took a bus through the city and saw all the fancy cars."

"That sounds cool!" Charlene said. "I've seen pictures of the palace and the casino. It looks really pretty."

"Definitely," Bennie agreed. "And the people watching is great. Everyone's so dressed up, even on the street."

Charlene smiled. "Yeah, I can imagine that would be fun to see. Maybe one day we'll go back."

Bennie nodded. "Yeah, maybe. Do you think it would be weird to visit a whole city just for the rich people watching?"

Charlene shrugged. "I don't know. It might be kind of interesting. But also kind of awkward if everyone's staring at us because we're not dressed up like that."

Bennie chuckled. "Yeah, maybe so. We'd stick out like sore thumbs for sure."

Write a slice-of-life story about Marco discussing Crimea in a kitchen.<start>Marco and Sofia stood at the counter in the small kitchen, surrounded by the warm smell of freshly baked bread. They were both making sandwiches for their lunch.

"I'm thinking," Marco said, "about Crimea."

Sofia looked at him curiously. "Crimea? What's that?"

Marco put down his knife and plate. "It's a place in Ukraine. It used to be part of Russia."

Sofia nodded, her eyes wide with interest. "I've heard of it. Isn't there something about a war?"

Marco took a deep breath before answering. "Yes. There was a conflict between Russia and Ukraine for control of Crimea. Russia ended up taking it over in 2014."

Sofia frowned. "That's not right. I thought Crimea was supposed to be part of Ukraine."

"It is," Marco said firmly. "But Russia claims that Crimea is theirs, and they've kept a big military presence there ever since the conflict."

The two friends stood in silence for a moment, lost in their own thoughts.

Sofia spoke up first. "Do you think it will always be like this?"

Marco hesitated before answering. "I hope not. Ukraine deserves to have control over its own land."

They both went back to making their sandwiches, the warm bread and cheese a comforting contrast to the seriousness of their conversation.

As they ate at the small table in the kitchen, Sofia turned to Marco with concern etched on her face. "Do you think there will ever be peace between Russia and Ukraine?"

Marco put down his sandwich and took a moment before answering. "I hope so. Peace is what we all want."

Write a slice-of-life story about Viola discussing Monaco at a campsite.<start>Viola sat on her sleeping mat at the campsite, looking out at the trees swaying in the wind. Her friend, Emma, sat beside her.

"What are you thinking about?" Emma asked.

"Monaco," Viola said, turning to face her friend.

"Why Monaco?" Emma asked.

"I don't know," Viola replied. "I just did some research on it and I'm curious."

Emma leaned forward, interested. "Tell me what you found out."

Viola pulled out a map from her backpack and spread it out between them. "It's a country located in Europe. It borders the Mediterranean Sea."

Emma looked at the map. "How small is Monaco?"

"Monaco is very small," Viola said. "In fact, it's the second-smallest country in the world after the Vatican City."

"I've never been to Monaco," Emma said.

"Me neither," Viola replied. "But I'd love to visit one day."

Emma nodded. "It would be cool to walk along the coastline and see the famous casino."

Viola smiled. "Yeah, that sounds like a great experience."

The two friends sat in comfortable silence for a moment, watching the sun begin to set behind the trees.

"Do you think Monaco is more famous because of its Grand Prix?" Emma asked after a while.

Viola nodded. "I think so. I read that it's one of the most famous racing events in the world."

Emma leaned back against her sleeping mat. "It sounds like an amazing experience to attend a Grand Prix there."

The two friends continued their conversation, discussing Monaco and its unique history, as the stars began to twinkle above them.

Write a slice-of-life story about Stephen, Vanessa, and Moses discussing Turkey in a bus.<start>Stephen, Vanessa, and Moses were sitting in their seats on the bus. They had been friends since school days.

Moses spoke up first. "Hey guys, have you ever been to Turkey?"

Vanessa looked at him curiously. "Turkey? I don't think so. Why, did you go there?"

"No," said Moses, shaking his head. "But my cousin went last year and told me about it. He said the food is amazing."

Stephen leaned in. "Food? What kind of food?"

"Kebabs, mostly," replied Moses. "And he said the people are very friendly. But also, he warned me that the traffic can be crazy."

Vanessa raised an eyebrow. "Crazy? That sounds like our usual rush hour back home."

Stephen chuckled. "Yeah, I guess everywhere has its own version of chaos."

The bus slowed down at a red light, and Moses pulled out his phone to check some pictures on social media. Vanessa glanced over at him. "What's that picture?"

Moses turned the screen towards her. It was a photo of a famous mosque in Istanbul.

Stephen pointed at it. "Is that the Blue Mosque?"

"Yes," said Moses, smiling proudly. "My cousin took that from right outside the entrance."

The bus started moving again, and they returned to their seats. Vanessa thought for a moment before speaking up. "You know what? I think I'd like to try some Turkish food sometime. Maybe we can look into traveling there together?"

Stephen and Moses looked at each other, then back at her with smiles. The conversation continued as the bus took them closer to their destination.

Write a slice-of-life story about Briana and Jude discussing Ice Age at a cemetery.<start>Briana and Jude sat on a bench in the quiet cemetery. They had come to visit Briana's grandmother's grave, but they ended up talking instead.

"I just watched Ice Age again," Briana said, smiling. "I love Manny."

"Manny is so cool," Jude agreed. "He's like a big, tough dinosaur, but he has a soft spot for Sid."

Briana nodded. "And then there's Scrat. He's always chasing after that acorn. It's so funny!"

Jude laughed. "Yeah, I love how obsessed he is with it. I think we can all relate to being a little bit like Scrat sometimes."

They sat in silence for a moment, watching the sun filter through the trees.

"Ice Age makes me think about my childhood," Briana said softly. "I used to watch it all the time with my grandma. She loved the characters too."

Jude put his arm around her shoulders. "It's okay to hold onto happy memories like that. They make life richer, you know?"

Briana smiled up at him. "Yeah, I do."

As they sat together on the bench, the cemetery seemed quieter than before. The only sound was the rustling of leaves in the breeze.

"I'm glad we came here," Jude said, his voice low and gentle.

"Me too," Briana replied, snuggling into his side.

Write a slice-of-life story about Lloyd, Emery, and Juan discussing France in a daycare center.<start>Lloyd was sitting at a table with his friends Emery and Juan. They were all wearing yellow shirts that said "Daycare Center" on them.

"I like France," Lloyd said. He was smiling.

"Why?" Emery asked. She had a curious look on her face.

"Because they have nice food!" Lloyd said. "I want to eat crepes."

Juan nodded. "Yes, I like crepes too!"

"What else is good in France?" Emery asked.

"Oh, the Eiffel Tower," Juan said. "It's so tall and pretty!"

Lloyd looked up at the ceiling. "I think it's higher than our building!"

Emery giggled. "Maybe we can build a tower just like it when we grow up."

Juan smiled. "That would be great! But first, let's learn about France."

The three friends sat quietly for a moment, thinking about France.

"I know!" Lloyd said suddenly. "We can make some French flags to decorate the playroom!"

Emery clapped her hands. "Yes, that's a great idea!"

Juan stood up. "I'll get the paper and crayons."

Together, they walked over to the art table, excited to start their project.

As they worked on their flags, Lloyd said, "France is a nice place, isn't it?"

Emery nodded. "Yes, I think so too."

Write a slice-of-life story about Ora discussing Eclipse in a kitchen.<start>Ora was standing by the counter, chopping vegetables for dinner. Her roommate, Nia, came into the kitchen.

"Hey, what's that?" Nia asked, pointing to a calendar on the wall.

"It's our astronomy club meeting reminder," Ora said, putting down the knife. "We're going to discuss the upcoming Eclipse."

Nia walked over to the counter and sat down next to Ora. "I've been reading about it online. It's just a shadow of the moon falling on the earth."

"That's right," Ora said, smiling. "A solar eclipse is when the moon passes directly between the sun and the earth. And then there's a lunar eclipse which is the opposite, when the earth comes between the sun and the moon."

Nia looked confused. "But why does it happen sometimes and not others?"

"It happens because of how our planets are aligned," Ora explained patiently. "The Earth, Moon, and Sun have to be in a straight line for an eclipse to occur."

They both fell silent as they chopped vegetables together.

"Ora?" Nia asked after a while.

"Yeah?"

"Do you think we should go watch the Eclipse with the astronomy club?"

Ora nodded enthusiastically. "Yes! I'd love to see it. We can take our telescopes and observe it from home."

Nia smiled. "Okay, let's make some plans."

August was getting a haircut from Maxwell, while Alton waited for his turn to sit in the chair.

"Hey guys, have you ever been to Australia?" August asked, looking up at Maxwell with curiosity in his eyes.

Maxwell paused mid-cut, thinking about it before responding. "Actually, no I haven't. But my cousin went there on vacation last year and she said it was amazing."

August nodded enthusiastically. "I've always wanted to go! I've heard the beaches are incredible. Have you ever been to a beach with white sand?" he asked Alton.

Alton, who had been quietly listening in, shook his head. "No, not really. But my grandparents used to take me to the lake when I was a kid and it felt like that."

Maxwell smiled as he continued cutting August's hair. "You should totally go to Australia sometime, August! Maybe you can even convince Alton to come with you!"

August grinned at the idea. "That would be awesome! We could snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef together." He turned back to Maxwell. "What did your cousin say about the food?"

Maxwell chuckled. "She said it was pretty good, but that the Vegemite sandwiches were a bit too strong for her taste."

Alton snorted. "Vegemite's not that bad! I've had it before and it's actually pretty tasty when you put it on toast with avocado."

August laughed. "See, Maxwell, Alton agrees with me!"

The three friends continued to chat about Australia, making plans and sharing stories as they waited for their haircuts to finish.

Write a slice-of-life story about Johnie and Nevaeh discussing Maine in a hospital room.<start>Johnie sat up in bed, his eyes fixed on Nevaeh as she leaned against the window frame. Outside, the sun was shining through the blinds.

"Hey," Johnie said softly. "I'm thinking about Maine."

Nevaeh turned to him. "Oh? What's making you think of that?"

Johnie shrugged, trying not to move too much on his sore back. "Just remembering our trip last summer. We drove up there for vacation, remember?"

Nevaeh smiled. "How could I forget? The lobster and the lighthouses...it was one of my favorite trips."

Johnie chuckled, feeling a little better now that they were talking about something pleasant. "Yeah, it was pretty great. And you loved walking along the coast, right?"

"Right," Nevaeh said, her eyes sparkling with memories. "It's so peaceful there. The sound of the waves and the sea air...it's like nothing else."

Johnie nodded, his thoughts drifting back to their time in Maine. "We should go back sometime. Maybe next year."

Nevaeh's expression turned thoughtful. "I'd like that," she said quietly. "It would be good to get out of here for a bit and just relax."

Johnie smiled at her, feeling grateful for the chance to talk about something he loved with the person he cared about most.

Write a slice-of-life story about Haley and Malachi discussing Solar System in a shopping mall.<start>Haley and Malachi walked hand in hand through the crowded shopping mall. They had stopped to rest for a bit after eating lunch.

"I'm so bored," Haley said, looking around at the shops. "What do you want to do?"

"Let's talk about the Solar System," Malachi suggested with a smile.

Haley thought for a moment before nodding her head. "Okay, that sounds cool."

As they walked, Malachi started explaining. "The Solar System is all the planets and other things that go around the sun. It's like a big circle in space."

"Whoa, that's huge!" Haley exclaimed.

"Yeah, it's really big," Malachi agreed. "There are eight planets: Mercury, Mars, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. But some people don't count Pluto as a planet anymore because it's so small."

"I never knew that," Haley said with interest. "What about the other things in the Solar System? You said there were more than just planets?"

"That's right!" Malachi replied. "There are also moons, asteroids, and comets. Moons orbit around the planets, like how our moon goes around Earth."

"Wow, that's amazing," Haley said, eyes wide with wonder.

As they continued walking, they came across a big display window showing pictures of the Solar System. Haley pointed excitedly at one of them. "Hey, look! That's Jupiter. I remember you telling me it's the biggest planet!"

Malachi nodded proudly. "That's right! It's really massive."

They stood there for a moment, taking in the colorful images and learning more about the vastness of space.

"Thanks for teaching me about the Solar System," Haley said to Malachi with a smile.

"No problem," Malachi replied, squeezing her hand. "I love sharing cool facts with you."

Write a slice-of-life story about Sabrina, Milton, and Will discussing Horse in a barber shop.<start>The barber shop was quiet except for the hum of clippers. Sabrina sat in a chair, her hair being cut by Milton. Will leaned against the counter, watching them.

"What's your favorite animal?" Milton asked Sabrina as he worked on her hair.

"I like horses," she said. "I think they're beautiful."

Will nodded. "Me too. I had a horse when I was a kid."

Milton looked up from cutting Sabrina's hair. "Really? What was its name?"

"It was named Thunder," Will said with a smile. "He was a black horse with a white patch on his forehead."

Sabrina turned to look at Will. "I've always wanted to ride a horse. I think it would be so much fun."

Milton chuckled as he continued cutting Sabrina's hair. "You should try riding lessons sometime," he said.

Will nodded in agreement. "Yeah, you'd love it."

The three of them stood there for a moment, thinking about horses and what it might be like to ride one.

As Milton finished cutting Sabrina's hair, Will spoke up again. "I'm going to go grab some coffee from next door. Does anyone want anything?"

Sabrina shook her head, but Milton said he would get a cup. The three of them continued discussing horses as they waited for their drinks.
