"It's okay, I guess," Lizzie said with a laugh. "I prefer something else."

Nathan chuckled. "You're not a fan of raw fish?"

"No way!" Lizzie joked.

As they talked, people passed by them on the platform. The sound of announcements and chatter filled the air.

"Do you think it's hard to learn Japanese?" Nathan asked.

"Yeah, I've heard it's tough," Lizzie said. "I know someone who studied for months and still couldn't speak it well."

Nathan nodded thoughtfully. "It sounds like a challenge."

Olive nodded. "I know. My sister is studying abroad right now. She called me last night to say that her university has closed all the dorms because someone tested positive."

Rachel frowned. "That's scary. What does she plan on doing?"

"She said they're setting up temporary housing for students," Olive replied, getting up from the bench. "And she has to stay inside for now."

Rachel stood up and stretched. "Okay, well, at least you're safe here in the city. We should be okay if we just follow what the doctors say."

Olive nodded in agreement. "Yeah, they're saying to wash our hands a lot and avoid close contact with people who might have it. It's not so bad as long as we take precautions."

Rachel smiled. "Exactly! And we can always wear masks when we go out if we need to."

The two friends walked over to the water fountain to refill their bottles, both thinking about how they could stay safe during this time.

"Halley's Comet is coming," Hayden said, turning to Emily. "I saw it on TV last night."

"It's a big rock that moves through space," Hayden explained. "It only comes close to Earth every seventy-six years or so. The next time it will pass by is in 2061."

Emily nodded, taking this information in. "That's amazing," she said. "I had no idea."

"I know," Hayden said. "My dad told me about it when I was a kid. He said that Halley's Comet has been seen by humans for centuries. People used to think it was an omen or something."

Emily raised an eyebrow. "An omen?" she repeated.

"Yeah, some people thought it was a sign from God," Hayden said. "But now we know it's just a big rock in space."

The two of them stood there for a moment, looking at the stars in the painting. Then Emily spoke up again.

"Do you think it would be cool to see Halley's Comet?" she asked.

Hayden nodded enthusiastically. "Definitely," he said. "I'd love to see it with my own eyes."

Emily smiled. "Me too," she said.

The woman standing on stage began to talk. She was wearing a name tag that said "Dr. Rodriguez". 

"Welcome, everyone! Today we're going to talk about one of America's most famous natural wonders: the Grand Canyon."

Dominique and Megan looked at each other excitedly. They had both been to the Grand Canyon before.

"The Grand Canyon is located in Arizona," Dr. Rodriguez started, "and it was formed by a river over millions of years. It's about six thousand feet deep!"

Megan took out her phone and opened up Google. She quickly pulled up some pictures of the canyon. Dominique looked at them with interest.

"There are so many different types of rocks in the Grand Canyon," Dr. Rodriguez continued, "like limestone, granite, and sandstone."

Dominique nodded along as she listened to the talk. Megan was taking notes on her phone.

"What's the future of the Grand Canyon?" someone in the audience asked.

"Well," Dr. Rodriguez said, "the park service is working hard to protect the canyon from pollution and erosion. They also want people to visit it responsibly."

Dominique and Megan exchanged a glance after the question. They had been guilty of taking too many pictures on their last trip.

The woman on stage finished her talk. She smiled at the audience as she left the stage.

"That was really interesting," Dominique said, getting up from her seat.

"Definitely," Megan agreed, standing next to her friend.

Madison nodded. "I know what you mean. My mom grew up in Albuquerque and she's always talking about it. She loves the green chile stew."

Emily laughed. "Oh yeah, that stuff is good! We tried it at this one restaurant in Santa Fe. It was so spicy!"

They both sipped their drinks for a moment.

"I really want to visit someday," Madison said. "Have you ever driven through the high desert?"

"Not yet," Emily said, "but my family took the scenic route through the mountains once. It was breathtaking."

Madison looked out at her own backyard. "You know, I sometimes wish we had a little bit of that here. A tiny bit of New Mexico charm in our own neighborhood."

Emily smiled. "I think we have it right now," she said, gesturing to the patio and the sky above.

They sat together for a while longer, enjoying the sunshine and each other's company.

"Well, it's really long," Drew replied. "I think it's over 4,000 miles long."

"That's amazing," Emily said. "I had no idea it was that long. What's the purpose of it?"

"The Nile is very important for Egypt and other countries around it," Drew explained. "It provides water for people to drink and for crops to grow. Without it, many people wouldn't have enough food or water."

Emily nodded thoughtfully. "I can see how that would be a big deal. What else did you learn about the Nile?"

Drew took another sip of his water before responding. "It's also very special because of its history. Many famous ancient civilizations lived along the Nile, like the Egyptians who built all those pyramids."

Levi looked concerned. "I saw a picture of a big wave on TV. It was like nothing I've ever seen before. Can you get swept away by the water?"

"Yes," Alex replied. "If you're too close to the ocean when the tsunami hits, it can take you out to sea with it. That's why people need to be warned and leave quickly."

Levi thought about this for a moment. "I saw a video of people running from the wave. They were shouting and crying. It was very sad."

"I'm thinking of watching Shark Week," said Delbert. "I've always found sharks fascinating."

"Really?" replied Dorothea. "Why is that?"

Delbert thought for a moment before answering. "Well, I think it's because sharks are so powerful and efficient. They can swim really fast and have those sharp teeth."

"Yes, they do," said Dorothea. "But don't you also feel sorry for them? They get misunderstood all the time."

"Like what?" asked Delbert.

"Well, people always think of great whites as aggressive monsters," said Dorothea. "But some species of sharks are actually quite harmless."

"That's true," said Delbert. "I never thought about it that way. Maybe we can watch a documentary on all the different types of sharks together?"

"Sounds like fun," replied Dorothea, smiling up at him.

As they continued walking through the mall, Delbert turned to Dorothea and asked, "Have you ever swum in the ocean?"

Dorothea shook her head. "No, I haven't. But I've always wanted to try snorkeling."

Robyn nodded. "Exactly! And have you noticed how green it is? Even in the middle of summer, there are trees everywhere."

Robyn laughed. "Good idea! Or maybe just get some new ones that can handle shade better."

As they talked, a plane flew overhead, its engines roaring loudly. Robyn and Alex watched it until it disappeared into the distance.

"I'm glad we moved here," Robyn said. "It feels like there's always something to do, but at the same time, it's easy to relax too."

Alex nodded in agreement. "Definitely. What are your plans for tonight?"

Robyn shrugged. "Not much, just a movie night at home. You?"

"Same here," Alex replied. "We should order some pizza and make it a real event."

Katie shook her head. "No, she passed away when I was in middle school. But my mom got another cat after that. His name is Mittens."

Katie laughed. "No, not really! Mittens would rather just nap. But sometimes my mom will tease him with a toy mouse, and he'll chase it around the house."
