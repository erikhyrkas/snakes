What SQL query would you use to retrieve a list of all products from the "Products" table where the price is less than $500 and sort them in descending order by price?<start>**SQL Query: Products with Price < $500**
=====================================================

To retrieve a list of all products from the "Products" table where the price is less than $500, sorted in descending order by price, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE Price < 500
ORDER BY Price DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

* `SELECT *` retrieves all columns (`*`) from the "Products" table.
* `FROM Products` specifies the table to query.
* `WHERE Price < 500` filters the results to only include rows where the price is less than $500.
* `ORDER BY Price DESC` sorts the remaining results in descending order by price.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose you have a "Products" table with the following data:

| ProductID | Name         | Price |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 1         | Product A    | 300   |
| 2         | Product B    | 400   |
| 3         | Product C    | 600   |
| 4         | Product D    | 200   |
| 5         | Product E    | 450   |

Running the above query on this data would return:

| ProductID | Name         | Price |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 4         | Product D    | 200   |
| 1         | Product A    | 300   |
| 5         | Product E    | 450   |
| 2         | Product B    | 400   |

Note that the results are sorted in descending order by price.<end>

What SQL query should be used to retrieve all movie titles from the `movies` table along with their box office earnings (in millions) for each release year, but if a movie does not exist in the `movie_info` table, include a title of 'Unknown' and earnings of $0 for that release year?

**Relevant Details:**

* The `movies` table contains the following columns:
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `title`
	+ `release_year`
| id | title     | release_year |
| --- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Star Wars | 1977          |
| 2   | Jaws      | 1975          |
| 3   | E.T.       | 1982          |

* The `movie_info` table contains the following columns:
	+ `release_year`
	+ `box_office_earnings` (in millions)
| release_year | box_office_earnings |
| --- | ---------------------- |
| 1998        | 304.94                |
| 1974        | 430.0                 |
| 1991        | 510.62                |
| 1978        | 834.62                |
| 1974        | 463.78                |
| 1993        | 543.91                |
| 2011        | 534.58                |

Note: The `movie_info` table has a foreign key relationship with the `movies` table through the `release_year` column, but it's not explicitly mentioned in this problem statement.<start>**SQL Query to Retrieve Movie Titles and Box Office Earnings**

To achieve the desired result, we can use a LEFT JOIN operation between the `movies` table and the `movie_info` table on the `release_year` column. The following SQL query accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
  m.title AS movie_title,
  COALESCE(mi.box_office_earnings, 0) AS earnings_in_millions
FROM 
  movies m
  LEFT JOIN movie_info mi ON m.release_year = mi.release_year
ORDER BY 
  m.release_year;
```

**How the Query Works:**

1. The `LEFT JOIN` operation combines rows from both tables based on the condition that the `release_year` column is equal in both tables.
2. If a movie exists in the `movies` table but not in the `movie_info` table, the result will contain NULL values for the earnings.
3. To handle this situation, we use the `COALESCE` function to replace NULL values with 0.

**Example Use Case:**

Running this query would return:

| movie_title | earnings_in_millions |
| --- | ---------------------- |
| Star Wars   | 834.62                |
| Jaws        | 430.00                |
| E.T.         | 304.94                |

For the years without a corresponding movie in the `movies` table, you would see:

| movie_title | earnings_in_millions |
| --- | ---------------------- |
| Unknown    | 0                     |

Note that if there are movies with multiple entries in the `movie_info` table for the same release year (like Jaws with releases in 1974), this query will only return one row per unique movie title, using the first matching entry from the `movie_info` table.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires a SELECT with a RIGHT JOIN:

What is the average Cache Hit Ratio (%) for each day in the given dataset, including days without any data? The table "performance_metrics" contains the following columns:
| Queries per Second | Cache Hit Ratio (%) | Connection Count | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The "Timestamp" column contains dates and times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. Can you write a SQL query to retrieve the average Cache Hit Ratio (%) for each day, including days without any data?<start>Here's how you can solve this problem using a RIGHT JOIN:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(p1.Timestamp) AS Date,
    AVG(p1.Cache_Hit_Ratio) AS Average_Cache_Hit_Ratio
FROM 
    performance_metrics p1
RIGHT JOIN 
    (SELECT DISTINCT Timestamp FROM performance_metrics) p2
ON 
    DATE(p1.Timestamp) = DATE(p2.Timestamp)
GROUP BY 
    DATE(p1.Timestamp);
```

In this solution, we're joining the "performance_metrics" table with a derived table that contains distinct timestamps. The RIGHT JOIN is used to include all days in the result set, even if there's no data for that day.

However, since the question specifically asks about an average Cache Hit Ratio, it implies you might want to aggregate metrics from multiple rows. 

A more idiomatic solution using a RIGHT JOIN would be:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(p1.Timestamp) AS Date,
    AVG(p1.Cache_Hit_Ratio) AS Average_Cache_Hit_Ratio
FROM 
    performance_metrics p1
RIGHT JOIN 
    (SELECT DISTINCT Timestamp FROM performance_metrics) p2
ON 
    DATE(p1.Timestamp) = DATE(p2.Timestamp)
GROUP BY 
    DATE(p1.Timestamp);
```

A more concise and intuitive way to write this query is by using the GROUP BY clause directly on the table, without needing a derived table:

```sql
SELECT 
    Date,
    AVG(Cache_Hit_Ratio) AS Average_Cache_Hit_Ratio
FROM 
    performance_metrics
GROUP BY 
    DATE(Timestamp);
```

This form of the query will achieve the same result as the original solution with the RIGHT JOIN.<end>

What is the average rating of all movies in the Romance and Science Fiction genres combined, ordered by highest rating first? 

The relevant tables are:

* `Movies` with columns:
	+ `Title`
	+ `Genre`
	+ `Publication Year`
	+ `Rating`

The `Movies` table has the following sample data:
```
| Title           | Genre        | Publication Year | Rating |
| ---             | ---          | ---              | ---    |
| The Forgotten World | Romance     | 1967              | 1.4    |
| A Journey Through Time | Mystery      | 1969              | 2.5    |
| The Last Sky   | Romance      | 1967              | 2.6    |
| The Last Sky   | Science Fiction | 1953              | 1.2    |
| Echoes of Eternity | Fantasy      | 2004              | 1.4    |
| Legends of the Rift | Romance     | 1975              | 4.8    |
| Whispers of the Abyss | Thriller     | 1963              | 2.4    |
| Tales of the Brave | Thriller     | 1954              | 3.2    |
| The Crystal Key | Science Fiction | 1992              | 2.9    |
```

The programmer would need help with writing a SQL query that combines movies from both Romance and Science Fiction genres using an INNER JOIN, and then selects the average rating of all combined movies in descending order by their average rating.<start>**SQL Query: Average Rating of Combined Romance and Science Fiction Movies**

```sql
SELECT AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM (
  SELECT *
  FROM Movies
  WHERE Genre IN ('Romance', 'Science Fiction')
) AS combined_movies
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

Let me explain how this query works:

1. We use a subquery to select all movies from the `Movies` table where the genre is either 'Romance' or 'Science Fiction'. This is done using an INNER JOIN with the IN operator.
2. The subquery selects all columns (`*`) for simplicity, but in practice, you might want to specify only the columns needed.
3. We select the average rating of all combined movies using the `AVG` aggregation function.
4. Finally, we order the results by the average rating in descending order using the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Note:** Since we're selecting the average rating, we can omit unnecessary columns from the subquery for better performance and readability.

Assuming your `Movies` table has the provided sample data, this query would yield:

| avg_rating |
| ---        |
| 3.88       |

This result indicates that the combined Romance and Science Fiction movies have an average rating of approximately 3.88.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires a SELECT with a FULL JOIN:

What would be the most efficient way to combine data from two tables, `Movies` and `TV_Shows`, into one result set, including all columns from both tables for each row? The `Movies` table has the following structure:
| Title | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Echoes of Eternity | Non-Fiction | 1963 | 2.3 |
| Whispers of the Abyss | Romance | 1988 | 2.1 |
| The Forgotten World | Thriller | 1965 | 2.0 |

The `TV_Shows` table has the following structure:
| Title | Genre | Release Year | Number of Episodes | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starlight | Drama | 2019 | 10 | 4.5 |
| Galactic Odyssey | Sci-Fi | 2020 | 20 | 4.2 |
| Lost in Space | Adventure | 2018 | 16 | 4.1 |

Note that the `Movies` and `TV_Shows` tables have some common columns (Genre, Rating), but also have some unique columns specific to each table. How can a SELECT statement be written to return all columns from both tables for each row, even if there is no match between them?<start>```sql
SELECT 
    M.Title AS Title_Movies,
    M.Genre AS Genre_Movies,
    M.Publication_Year AS Publication_Year_Movies,
    M.Rating AS Rating_Movies,
    T.Title AS Title_TV_Shows,
    T.Genre AS Genre_TV_Shows,
    T.Release_Year AS Release_Year_TV_Shows,
    T.Number_of_Episodes AS Number_of_Episodes_TV_Shows,
    T.Rating AS Rating_TV_Shows
FROM 
    Movies M
FULL JOIN 
    TV_Shows T ON M.Title = T.Title;
```<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires SELECT with a self JOIN:

What is the average daily price range (High Price - Close Price) for each company's stock prices on days when their Volume was greater than 5 million, compared to the overall average daily price range across all companies? 

Company data is stored in the table "StockData" with columns: Company (varchar), Date (datetime), Open Price (float), Close Price (float), High Price (float), and Volume (int). The expected output should include the company name, the difference between the high and close prices on days with high volume, and the overall average daily price range.<start>Here is how you can solve it using SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(sd1.Company, sd2.Company) AS Company,
    COALESCE((sd1.High - sd1.Close), 0) AS HighLowDiff_HighVolumeDays,
    COALESCE(overall_avg_diff, 0) AS Overall_Avg_Diff
FROM (
    SELECT Company, (High - Close) AS HighLowDiff 
    FROM StockData WHERE Volume > 5000000
) sd1
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT Company, (High - Close) AS HighLowDiff 
    FROM StockData WHERE Volume > 5000000
) sd2 ON sd1.Company = sd2.Company
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT AVG((High - Close)) 
    FROM StockData WHERE Volume > 5000000
) ca (overall_avg_diff)
```

However, you can also achieve this using a self join on the `StockData` table like so:

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(sd1.Company, sd2.Company) AS Company,
    COALESCE((sd1.High - sd1.Close), 0) AS HighLowDiff_HighVolumeDays,
    COALESCE(overall_avg_diff, 0) AS Overall_Avg_Diff
FROM StockData sd1
LEFT JOIN StockData sd2 ON sd1.Company = sd2.Company AND sd1.Volume > 5000000 AND sd2.Volume > 5000000 
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT AVG((sd1.High - sd1.Close)) 
    FROM StockData sd1
    WHERE sd1.Volume > 5000000
) ca (overall_avg_diff)
GROUP BY COALESCE(sd1.Company, sd2.Company), overall_avg_diff
```

Note that this solution will group the results by company and overall average daily price range. If you want to avoid using `CROSS APPLY`, you can also use a subquery:

```sql
SELECT 
    Company,
    HighLowDiff_HighVolumeDays,
    Overall_Avg_Diff
FROM (
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(sd1.Company, sd2.Company) AS Company,
        COALESCE((sd1.High - sd1.Close), 0) AS HighLowDiff_HighVolumeDays,
        COALESCE(overall_avg_diff, 0) AS Overall_Avg_Diff
    FROM StockData sd1
    LEFT JOIN StockData sd2 ON sd1.Company = sd2.Company AND sd1.Volume > 5000000 AND sd2.Volume > 5000000 
    CROSS APPLY (
        SELECT AVG((sd1.High - sd1.Close)) 
        FROM StockData sd1
        WHERE sd1.Volume > 5000000
    ) ca (overall_avg_diff)
) AS Results
GROUP BY Company, Overall_Avg_Diff
```<end>

What SQL query would return all rows from the "StockPrices" table where the company name starts with 'A', and the Close Price is greater than 800, assuming the StockPrices table has the following structure:

| Company | Date | Close Price | High Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |<start>To achieve this, you can use a combination of the `WHERE` clause to filter by conditions. The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM StockPrices
WHERE Company LIKE 'A%' AND Close Price > 800;
```

However, since SQL is case-sensitive and typically uses backticks or square brackets around identifiers in some dialects if they contain special characters (like spaces), it's generally a good practice to enclose table and column names in these. Yet, for simplicity, we'll assume the standard SQL behavior here.

This query does the following:

- `SELECT *`: Selects all columns (`*`) from the table.
- `FROM StockPrices`: Specifies that we're working with the "StockPrices" table.
- `WHERE Company LIKE 'A%' AND Close Price > 800;`:
  - `Company LIKE 'A%'`: This part of the condition selects rows where the company name starts with 'A'. The `%` is a wildcard character in SQL that matches any number of characters after 'A'.
  - `Close Price > 800`: This part filters out rows where the close price is not greater than 800.

Note: If your database management system (DBMS) doesn't follow standard SQL syntax or requires specific handling for identifiers containing special characters, you might need to adjust this query accordingly.<end>

What SQL query would return all rows from the "Inventory" table where the value in the "Quantity" column is NULL, while excluding any rows that have a matching "ProductID" with a non-NULL quantity in the "Products" table? 

| InventoryDB | ProductID | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| InventoryDB | 1        | NULL     |
| InventoryDB | 2        | 100       |
| InventoryDB | 3        | NULL     |
| InventoryDB | 4        | NULL     |
| InventoryDB | 5        | 50        |

| ProductsDB | ProductID | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ProductsDB | 1        | 200       |
| ProductsDB | 2        | NULL      |
| ProductsDB | 3        | 300       |<start>Here is the SQL query that would return all rows from the "Inventory" table where the value in the "Quantity" column is NULL, while excluding any rows that have a matching "ProductID" with a non-NULL quantity in the "Products" table:

```sql
SELECT i.*
FROM Inventory i
WHERE i.Quantity IS NULL
  AND i.ProductID NOT IN (
    SELECT p.ProductID
    FROM Products p
    WHERE p.Quantity IS NOT NULL
  );
```

This query works as follows:

1. The subquery selects the `ProductID`s from the "Products" table where the quantity is not null.
2. The outer query then selects all rows from the "Inventory" table where the quantity is null, and the product ID does not appear in the list of IDs returned by the subquery.

Note: If you are using a database system that supports `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS` instead of `IN`, you can use the following alternative query:

```sql
SELECT i.*
FROM Inventory i
WHERE i.Quantity IS NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Products p
    WHERE p.ProductID = i.ProductID
      AND p.Quantity IS NOT NULL
  );
```

This query has similar semantics to the previous one, but uses `NOT EXISTS` instead of `IN`.<end>

What SQL query can I use to retrieve all devices that have a recorded battery level for the last time they were updated in the kitchen, where the battery level is NOT NULL and has been measured at least once? 

Table: DeviceMeasurements (contains the data shown above)

Assuming multiple records exist per device, we need to find each device's most recent timestamp while having a non-null battery level reading.<start>**SQL Query: Retrieve Devices with Most Recent Non-Null Battery Level Reading**

To achieve this, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  dm.device_id,
  dm.measurement_time AS last_measurement_time,
  dm.battery_level
FROM 
  DeviceMeasurements dm
WHERE 
  dm.measurement_location = 'kitchen'
  AND dm.battery_level IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
  dm.device_id, dm.measurement_time, dm.battery_level
HAVING 
  MAX(dm.measurement_time) OVER (PARTITION BY dm.device_id) = dm.measurement_time;
```

However, this query doesn't take into account that we need to get the most recent measurement time per device. The `MAX(measurement_time) OVER (PARTITION BY device_id)` is not necessary here because we're already grouping by `measurement_time`.

To solve this problem in a more efficient and correct way, you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
  dm.device_id,
  dm.measurement_time AS last_measurement_time,
  dm.battery_level
FROM (
  SELECT 
    device_id,
    measurement_time,
    battery_level,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY measurement_time DESC) AS rn
  FROM DeviceMeasurements
  WHERE measurement_location = 'kitchen' AND battery_level IS NOT NULL
) dm
WHERE dm.rn = 1;
```

This query will first assign a row number to each record per device, ordered by the `measurement_time` in descending order. It then selects only the rows with `rn = 1`, which corresponds to the most recent measurement time for each device.

**Example Use Case**

Let's say you have the following data:

| **device_id** | **measurement_time** | **battery_level** | **measurement_location** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A        | 2022-01-01 12:00:00 | 80                | kitchen              |
| A        | 2022-01-02 13:00:00 | NULL              | kitchen              |
| B        | 2022-01-03 14:00:00 | 90                | living room          |

Running the query above will return:

| **device_id** | **last_measurement_time** | **battery_level** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A        | 2022-01-02 13:00:00 | NULL              |
| B        | 2022-01-03 14:00:00 | 90                |

Note that device A has a `NULL` battery level, but it's still included in the result because we're looking for devices with at least one non-null measurement time.<end>

What is a SQL query that would return all states where there are at least two people who were born in either August or September and have an income of $300,000 or more? The relevant table name is "people" with the columns "State", "Birth Month", and "Income". The data type for these columns are as follows: State (varchar), Birth Month (varchar), Income (int).<start>Here is a SQL query that would return all states where there are at least two people who were born in either August or September and have an income of $300,000 or more:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p1.State 
FROM people p1
WHERE p1.Income >= 300000 AND (p1.Birth Month = 'August' OR p1.Birth Month = 'September')
GROUP BY p1.State
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p1.State) >= 2;
```

However, the query above is flawed because SQL does not support 'Birth Month = 'August'' or similar date comparison directly. So we would need to convert it into a more appropriate date range for month comparison.

Let's assume we have a table "people" with columns: State (varchar), Birth Date (date), and Income (int). The following query would be correct:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p1.State 
FROM people p1
WHERE p1.Income >= 300000 AND 
      (MONTH(p1.Birth Date) = 8 OR MONTH(p1.Birth Date) = 9)
GROUP BY p1.State
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p1.State) >= 2;
```

Note that this query assumes the 'Birth Month' column in your table actually represents a month and not just an abbreviation like "August". The MONTH() function is used to extract the month from the Birth Date. 

However, based on your original description of having columns for State (varchar), Birth Month (varchar), Income (int), you would have to convert 'Birth Month' into a numeric representation of months which could be cumbersome and not recommended if possible.

Another query using a more traditional date comparison approach with two separate COUNT() operations is also viable:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p1.State 
FROM people p1
WHERE p1.Income >= 300000 AND 
      (p1.Birth Month = 'August' OR p1.Birth Month = 'September')
GROUP BY p1.State
HAVING (COUNT(CASE WHEN p1.Birth Month = 'August' THEN p1.State END) + 
        COUNT(CASE WHEN p1.Birth Month = 'September' THEN p1.State END)) >= 2;
```

This query might be easier to write and understand given your original table structure.<end>

What is a SQL query that uses the OVER window function to return the rank of each person by their income within their city, and also include their current age as well as an additional column 'Income Percentile' which shows the percentage rank of each person's income compared to others in the same city? The table to draw data from is a simple 'Employees' table with columns for Name, Age, Birth Month, City, State, and Income. 

| Name | Age | Birth Month | City | State | Income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Irma | 21 | July | Atlanta | Tennessee | 25000 |
| Angie | 63 | August | Schenectady | Pennsylvania | 295000 |
| Annie | 61 | February | Santa Cruz | Michigan | 315000 |
| Marshall | 36 | May | Shakopee | Virginia | 195000 |
| Vanessa | 38 | July | West Valley City | California | 335000 |

The desired output should look something like this:

| Name | Age | City | Income | Rank in City | Income Percentile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Irma | 21 | Atlanta | 25000 | 1/2=0.5 | 0.25 |
| Angie | 63 | Schenectady | 295000 | 1/3=0.33 | 0.33 |
| Annie | 61 | Santa Cruz | 315000 | 1/4=0.25 | 0.25 |
| Marshall | 36 | Shakopee | 195000 | 2/3=0.67 | 0.67 |
| Vanessa | 38 | West Valley City | 335000 | 1/5=0.2 | 0.2 |

Note: The 'Income Percentile' column should be calculated as the income rank of each person divided by the total number of people in their city, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage value.<start>To achieve this result using SQL and the OVER window function, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT 
    Name,
    Age,
    City,
    Income,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Income) AS Rank_in_City,
    100 * COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Income) / DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Income) AS Income_Percentile
FROM 
    Employees;
```

However, note that the above query has a minor flaw in calculating the 'Income Percentile'. The correct way to calculate it is by taking the rank of each person's income within their city and dividing it by the total number of people in their city (not including themselves). This requires counting all rows first and then calculating the percentile for each row.

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT 
    Name,
    Age,
    City,
    Income,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Income) AS Rank_in_City,
    CAST(COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Income - 1) / DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Income) * 100 AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Income_Percentile
FROM 
    Employees;
```

In this corrected query:

- `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY City ORDER BY Income)` gives the rank of each person's income within their city.
- `DENSE_RANK()` is used instead of `RANK()` to prevent gaps in the ranking, which could happen if two people have the same income and there are more than one row for the next income value.

This query correctly calculates the 'Income Percentile' as the rank of each person's income within their city divided by the total number of people in their city (excluding themselves), then multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage. The `CAST` function is used to ensure that the result is displayed with two decimal places.

Note: This assumes you're using PostgreSQL or MySQL for this query, as both support the DENSE_RANK() window function. If your database system does not have this function available (which might be the case with Microsoft SQL Server, which instead uses the `DENSE_RANK()` aggregate function), then a different approach will be required.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with LAG:

What is the percentage difference in High Price between each consecutive day for companies listed on the stock exchange? The list of companies and their daily stock prices are stored in a table called `stock_prices` with columns:

| Company | Date       | High Price |
| ---    | ---        | ---       |
| TechnoCorp | 2013-05-04 | 1268.16   |
| MediaGroup | 2014-02-27 | 984.99    |
| BioLife   | 2018-01-04 | 1238.04   |
| FoodChain | 2022-01-26 | 890.89    |
| FinanceTrust | 2017-12-19 | 722.03    |
| AutoMotive | 2018-04-27 | 1268.16   |

Assuming the dates are in ascending order within each company, write a SQL query to calculate and display the percentage difference between consecutive High Price values for each company.<start>To solve this problem using SQL with LAG function, you will first need to select the company name and high price from the stock prices table, then use the LAG function to get the previous day's high price for each company.

However, since we are not explicitly given a "Date" column that represents consecutive days within each company (only unique dates across all companies), we'll assume dates are ordered ascendingly within each company as per your question. This is crucial because SQL doesn't inherently understand the concept of "consecutive days" in the context of unordered date sets without additional information like a timestamp or specific day ordering logic.

Here's how you can write a query to achieve this, assuming dates are indeed ordered and the LAG function can be used directly with caution:

```sql
SELECT Company,
       High Price AS current_price,
       (High Price - LAG(High Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Company ORDER BY Date)) / 
        NULLIF(LAG(High Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Company ORDER BY Date), 0) * 100 AS price_difference_percentage
FROM stock_prices;
```

**Important Notes:**

- This query assumes dates are in ascending order within each company as required by the LAG function's ordering logic.
- The `NULLIF` function is used to avoid division by zero when there is no previous high price for a given company, thus returning NULL (or in some SQL flavors, null) instead of an error.

**Handling Division by Zero and Displaying Result:**
If you need to display the result where it's 0% (to show a static value), you might want to apply a case statement or coalesce to avoid displaying NULL:

```sql
SELECT Company,
       High Price AS current_price,
       CASE WHEN price_difference_percentage IS NOT NULL THEN price_difference_percentage ELSE 0 END AS price_difference_percentage
FROM (
  SELECT Company,
         High Price,
         (High Price - LAG(High Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Company ORDER BY Date)) / 
          NULLIF(LAG(High Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Company ORDER BY Date), 0) * 100 AS price_difference_percentage
  FROM stock_prices
) AS subquery;
```

This query is a bit more complex, but it uses the `CASE` statement to replace any `NULL` values in the `price_difference_percentage` column with `0`, which might be what you want for displaying percentages.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with LEAD:

What is the average battery level for each device type in the devices table, excluding the last reading value for each device and only including readings where the timestamp is after 2022-01-01?

Assumptions:
- The 'devices' table contains columns: Device ID, Device Type, Location, Battery Level (%), Reading Value, and Timestamp.
- All relevant data is included in the example provided.<start>Here's a possible SQL solution to this problem:

```sql
SELECT 
    DeviceType,
    AVG(BatteryLevel) AS AverageBatteryLevel
FROM (
    SELECT 
        DeviceID,
        DeviceType,
        Location,
        BatteryLevel,
        ReadingValue,
        Timestamp,
        LEAD(Timestamp, 1, NULL) OVER (PARTITION BY DeviceID ORDER BY Timestamp) AS NextTimestamp
    FROM devices
    WHERE Timestamp > '2022-01-01' 
) subquery
WHERE TIMESTAMP IS NOT NULL AND TIMESTAMP = NextTimestamp
GROUP BY DeviceType;
```

This query uses the LEAD function to get the next timestamp for each device ID, and then filters out rows where the current row is not followed by its own timestamp. This effectively excludes the last reading value for each device.

The subquery selects all columns from `devices` table where timestamp > '2022-01-01'. 

In the outer query, we filter the subquery to only include rows where there exists a next timestamp and it's equal to the current row's timestamp (which means it's not the last reading for this device). We then group by DeviceType and calculate the average battery level.<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve a list of all books published in the year 1990-2002, ordered by their publication year and then by their rating in descending order, from the "Books" table? The table contains columns for Title, Author, Genre, Publication Year, and Rating.

Example data:
| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A Journey Through Time | Galen Starfire | Science Fiction | 1993 | 3.3 |
| Tales of the Brave | Rowan Ashborne | Fantasy | 2014 | 2.5 |
| Tales of the Brave | Kara Firebrand | Non-Fiction | 1952 | 3.2 |
| Echoes of Eternity | Orion Frostblade | Thriller | 2000 | 3.2 |
| A Journey Through Time | Elara Moonshadow | Non-Fiction | 1985 | 3.8 |

The query should only consider books published in or after the year 1990 and in or before the year 2002, but I have provided a table with data from 1952 to 2014 for context.<start>**SQL Query: Retrieving Books Published between 1990-2002**
===========================================================

Here is the SQL query that retrieves a list of all books published in the year 1990-2002, ordered by their publication year and then by their rating in descending order:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Books
WHERE Publication Year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2002
ORDER BY Publication_Year DESC,
         Rating DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

* The `BETWEEN` operator is used to select records where the `Publication Year` falls within the specified range (1990-2002).
* The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results by:
	1. `Publication_Year` in descending order (`DESC`). This ensures that books published later appear first.
	2. `Rating` in descending order (`DESC`). If two or more books have the same publication year, this sub-clause will sort them based on their rating.

**Example Use Case:**

Assuming the provided example data, running this query would return:

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A Journey Through Time | Galen Starfire | Science Fiction | 1993 | 3.3 |
| Echoes of Eternity | Orion Frostblade | Thriller | 2000 | 3.2 |

Note that only books published in or after 1990 and in or before 2002 are included in the results.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return the average battery level for each device type, grouped by location, and include only locations where there are at least two devices of different types? Assume the relevant data is stored in a table called "device_readings" with columns as shown above.<start>```sql
SELECT 
    l.location,
    d.device_type,
    AVG(dr.battery_level) AS avg_battery_level
FROM 
    device_readings dr
JOIN 
    locations l ON dr.location_id = l.id
JOIN 
    devices d ON dr.device_id = d.id
GROUP BY 
    l.location, d.device_type
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT d.device_type) > 1;
```<end>

What SQL command would I use to delete the entire 'Sensor_Readings' table from my database, including all its columns and rows, if it already contains data similar to the following example:

| Battery Level (%) | Reading Value | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 80.0 | 4.79 | 2021-02-27 10:39:13 |
| 41.4 | 30.23 | 2021-11-16 11:52:45 |
| 75.7 | 27.86 | 2021-01-20 09:28:09 |
| 15.5 | 77.52 | 2022-06-25 03:37:48 |
| 89.4 | 30.23 | 2022-05-04 02:33:00 |
| 18.0 | 62.78 | 2021-08-07 12:17:08 |
| 41.4 | 28.26 | 2022-05-08 05:18:09 |
| 23.0 | 65.06 | 2022-07-04 16:59:59 |

Note that the 'Sensor_Readings' table has three columns: 'Battery Level (%)', 'Reading Value', and 'Timestamp'.<start>You would use the `DROP TABLE` SQL command to delete the entire 'Sensor_Readings' table from your database. The syntax for this command is:

```sql
DROP TABLE Sensor_Readings;
```

This will remove the entire table, including all its columns and rows.

**Note:** Be careful when using `DROP TABLE`, as it permanently deletes the table and all its data. It's a good practice to backup your data before running this command.

If you want to delete the table only if it exists (in case someone else might have created a different 'Sensor_Readings' table), you can add an `IF EXISTS` clause:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Sensor_Readings;
```

This will prevent any errors from occurring if the table doesn't exist.<end>

What SQL query would you use to insert a new record into the 'stock_prices' table with company name 'TechCorp', date '2024-02-15', open price of $200.00, and volume of 5000000? Assume the 'stock_prices' table already exists and has the following structure:

| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| Company     | VARCHAR(50) |
| Date        | DATE       |
| Open Price  | DECIMAL(10,2) |
| Volume      | INTEGER    |

And also assume that you have a separate 'company_info' table with the following structure:

| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| Company     | VARCHAR(50) |
| Industry    | VARCHAR(20) |
| Founded     | DATE       |

The 'stock_prices' table has a foreign key constraint referencing the 'Company' column in the 'company_info' table.<start>To insert a new record into the `stock_prices` table, you would use the following SQL query:

```sql
INSERT INTO stock_prices (Company, Date, Open Price, Volume)
VALUES ('TechCorp', '2024-02-15', 200.00, 5000000);
```

However, since the `Open Price` column is of type `DECIMAL(10,2)`, you should enclose the value in single quotes and use a decimal format to avoid any potential issues:

```sql
INSERT INTO stock_prices (Company, Date, Open Price, Volume)
VALUES ('TechCorp', '2024-02-15', 200.00, 5000000);
```

But it would be better to use the correct type of `DECIMAL` and provide two decimal places:

```sql
INSERT INTO stock_prices (Company, Date, Open Price, Volume)
VALUES ('TechCorp', '2024-02-15', 200.00, 5000000);
```

You can also use the following query if you want to specify the exact data type of the `Open Price` column:

```sql
INSERT INTO stock_prices (Company, Date, Open Price, Volume)
VALUES ('TechCorp', '2024-02-15', DECIMAL '200.00', 5000000);
```

In this case, you should be aware that some databases might not support the `DECIMAL` keyword and instead use a syntax like `DECIMAL(10,2)`.

Note: Since there's a foreign key constraint referencing the 'Company' column in the 'company_info' table, it's assumed that the company name 'TechCorp' exists in the 'company_info' table. If not, you would first need to insert the company information into the 'company_info' table and then you can proceed with inserting the stock price record into the 'stock_prices' table.<end>

What is a SQL query that will delete all rows from the "Employees" table where the income is greater than $450,000 and the employee's age is less than 40? The Employees table has columns for Name, Age, Birth Month, City, State, and Income.

| Name | Age | Birth Month | City | State | Income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shelby | 49 | December | Pueblo | Texas | 165000 |
| Rudolph | 66 | April | Hillsboro | Kentucky | 470000 |
| Monique | 61 | March | Utica | Connecticut | 50000 |
| Velma | 27 | November | Smyrna | Texas | 445000 |
| Emerson | 42 | November | Park Ridge | South Carolina | 250000 |
| Ralph | 20 | June | Cranston | Texas | 440000 |<start>Here is the SQL query that will delete all rows from the "Employees" table where the income is greater than $450,000 and the employee's age is less than 40:
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE Income > 450000 AND Age < 40;
```
This query uses the `DELETE` statement to remove rows from the table, and specifies the conditions for which rows to delete using the `WHERE` clause. The conditions are combined using the `AND` keyword to ensure that both conditions must be true for a row to be deleted.

Note: Be sure to run this query in a safe environment first, as it will permanently delete data from your table! If you're unsure, consider running a `SELECT` statement with the same conditions first to verify which rows would be affected.<end>

What SQL query would I need to update the 'Rating' column in the 'Books' table so that all rows with a 'Genre' of 'Non-Fiction' have their rating increased by 1 point if they were originally published before 1980? 

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tales of the Brave | Rowan Ashborne | Non-Fiction | 1969 | 2.5 |
| Legends of the Rift | Draven Blackthorn | Non-Fiction | 1988 | 2.9 |
| Legends of the Rift | Sylvia Nightshade | Historical | 1993 | 4.6 |

Note: The 'Books' table has an index that ensures faster lookups on the 'Genre' and 'Publication Year' columns.<start>Here is the SQL query to update the 'Rating' column in the 'Books' table based on your requirements:

```sql
UPDATE Books 
SET Rating = Rating + 1 
WHERE Genre = 'Non-Fiction' AND Publication Year < 1980;
```

This query works as follows:

- `UPDATE Books`: This clause begins the UPDATE operation, specifying that it will be updating rows in the 'Books' table.
- `SET Rating = Rating + 1`: If the conditions specified by the WHERE clause are met, this line updates the 'Rating' column by incrementing its value by 1 point.
- `WHERE Genre = 'Non-Fiction' AND Publication Year < 1980;`: This line specifies the conditions under which an update will occur. The table is updated for all rows where:
  - The row belongs to the 'Books' table (which is already specified in the UPDATE clause).
  - The 'Genre' column contains 'Non-Fiction'.
  - The 'Publication Year' column has a value less than 1980.

This query will update the 'Rating' column for all rows with a genre of 'Non-Fiction' that were published before 1980 by incrementing their rating by 1 point. 

**Before running this query, make sure to back up your database (or at least take a snapshot of the 'Books' table). This is a potentially destructive operation!**

If you want to see what changes would be made without actually making them, run a `SELECT` statement with the same conditions and compare the results. 

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose that after running this query on our example data:

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tales of the Brave | Rowan Ashborne | Non-Fiction | 1969 | 3.5 |
| Legends of the Rift | Draven Blackthorn | Non-Fiction | 1988 | 2.9 |
| Legends of the Rift | Sylvia Nightshade | Historical | 1993 | 4.6 |

This would mean that `Tales of the Brave` now has a rating of 3.5 instead of 2.5, because it was published before 1980 and belongs to 'Non-Fiction'.<end>

What SQL query would you use to create a table called "book_ratings" that includes columns for the book's title (max length 100 characters), genre (max length 50 characters), publication year, and an average rating of the book, along with a column for the number of times the book has been rated? The resulting table should have a foreign key constraint referencing the "books" table, which is assumed to be already created. 

Example data:
| Title | Genre | Publication Year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A Journey Through Time | Thriller | 1963 |
| Whispers of the Abyss | Science Fiction | 1961 |

Specific requirements for the "book_ratings" table:

- The average_rating column should be a decimal value between 0 and 10.
- The num_ratings column should keep track of how many times each book has been rated.
- There can only be one rating per book, so there should be a unique constraint on the foreign key referencing the "books" table.<start>Here is the SQL query to create the `book_ratings` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_ratings (
    title VARCHAR(100),
    genre VARCHAR(50),
    publication_year INT,
    average_rating DECIMAL(4,2) CHECK (average_rating BETWEEN 0 AND 10),
    num_ratings INT DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (title, genre, publication_year) REFERENCES books(title, genre, publication_year)
);

ALTER TABLE book_ratings
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_book_rating UNIQUE (title, genre, publication_year);
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- We create a table called `book_ratings` with columns for title, genre, publication year, average rating, and number of ratings.
- The `average_rating` column is a decimal value that can have at most 4 digits before the decimal point and 2 digits after the decimal point (i.e., between 0 and 10).
- The `num_ratings` column defaults to 1, meaning every book starts with one rating.
- We create a foreign key constraint referencing the "books" table using the primary key columns of both tables (`title`, `genre`, `publication_year`). This establishes a relationship between the two tables based on these common columns.
- Finally, we add a unique constraint to the foreign key combination of title, genre, and publication year.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires ALTER TABLE:

What would be the correct SQL query to add a new column called "Price" of data type decimal(5,2) to the existing "Products" table in the database, and then populate this column with the prices for each product as shown below:

| Product Name | SKU | Stock Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device | SKU-1005 | 90 |
| Thingamajig | SKU-1061 | 23 |
| Contraption | SKU-1038 | 225 |
| Contraption | SKU-1073 | 370 |
| Instrument | SKU-1086 | 257 |
| Gadget | SKU-1014 | 265 |
| Contraption | SKU-1005 | 348 |
| Contraption | SKU-1039 | 29 |
| Gadget | SKU-1018 | 3 |
| Instrument | SKU-1054 | 252 |

The prices for each product are as follows:
- Device: $19.99
- Thingamajig: $12.50
- Contraption: $25.00
- Instrument: $30.00
- Gadget: $15.00

Note that the prices may vary depending on the SKU, and some SKUs for a product may have different prices. How can you modify the "Products" table to include these prices?<start>**Solution**

To add a new column called "Price" with data type decimal(5,2) to the existing "Products" table and populate it with the corresponding prices, we'll use an ALTER TABLE statement along with an UPDATE query. Here's how:

```sql
-- Add a new column named 'Price' of data type decimal(5,2) to the 'Products' table
ALTER TABLE Products 
ADD Price decimal(5, 2);

-- Populate the 'Price' column based on the given prices for each product
UPDATE Products 
SET Price = (
    CASE 
        WHEN Product_Name = 'Device' THEN 19.99 
        WHEN Product_Name = 'Thingamajig' THEN 12.50 
        WHEN Product_Name = 'Contraption' THEN 25.00 
        WHEN Product_Name = 'Instrument' THEN 30.00 
        WHEN Product_Name = 'Gadget' THEN 15.00 
    END
);
```

This will update the "Products" table by adding a new column named "Price" with data type decimal(5,2) and then populate this column with the corresponding prices for each product.

**Important Notes:**

* Make sure to back up your database before making any changes.
* This SQL query assumes that the price values are in dollars (USD). If you need to use a different currency, modify the values accordingly.
* In case of multiple products with the same name but different SKUs having different prices, this approach will not work. You would need to store the prices based on the SKU instead of the Product Name.

Remember to execute these SQL queries in the order they appear above (ALTER TABLE followed by UPDATE) for them to work correctly.<end>

What SQL query would you use to extract the sum of Queries per Second from both LogsDB and MetricsDB tables where the Timestamp is between '2021-01-01' and '2022-12-31'?<start>To achieve this, assuming your database schema has `LogsDB` and `MetricsDB` tables with columns named `Timestamp`, `QueriesPerSecond`, and `other_columns`, you can use a SQL query that performs a union operation to combine the results from both tables. Here's how you might write such a query:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(QueriesPerSecond) AS TotalQueriesPerSecond
FROM (
    SELECT QueriesPerSecond FROM LogsDB 
    WHERE Timestamp BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT QueriesPerSecond FROM MetricsDB 
    WHERE Timestamp BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
) AS CombinedResults;
```

However, if the database is particularly large or performance becomes an issue with `UNION ALL`, you might want to consider using a single `SELECT` statement that combines the conditions in a more efficient way:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(QueriesPerSecond) AS TotalQueriesPerSecond
FROM (
    SELECT QueriesPerSecond FROM LogsDB WHERE Timestamp BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT QueriesPerSecond FROM MetricsDB WHERE Timestamp BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
) AS CombinedResults;
```

However, a more efficient approach without using `UNION` or `UNION ALL`, which can be expensive operations for large datasets, is to use a single query that filters both tables directly:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(l.QPS + m.QPS) AS TotalQueriesPerSecond
FROM LogsDB l
JOIN MetricsDB m ON 1=1  -- We're not using any columns from the join in this simplified example
WHERE l.Timestamp BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
AND m.Timestamp BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2022-12-31';
```

This approach combines the rows from both tables without actually joining them based on common columns. The `JOIN` statement is used here only to combine the queries, not for data comparison or aggregation across identical rows.

Remember that the actual performance and efficiency of these queries might depend heavily on your specific database schema, indexing, and size of data involved. Always test and analyze different approaches in a controlled environment before deploying them to production.<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve a list of products that are out of stock (Stock Quantity = 0), along with their respective category and supplier name from the Products table, which has the following structure:

| Product Name | SKU | Stock Quantity | Category | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

If there is no matching record in the Suppliers table, then include a column indicating 'No Supplier' in the output.<start>Here's the SQL query to retrieve the list of products that are out of stock along with their respective category and supplier name:

```sql
SELECT 
  p.Product_Name,
  p.SKU,
  p.Stock_Quantity AS Stock_Qty,
  c.Category_Name,
  COALESCE(s.Supplier_Name, 'No Supplier') AS Supplier
FROM 
  Products p
  LEFT JOIN Categories c ON p.Category = c.Category_ID
  LEFT JOIN Suppliers s ON p.Supplier_Name = s.Supplier_Name
WHERE 
  p.Stock_Quantity = 0;
```

Here's a breakdown of the query:

- We're joining the `Products` table (`p`) with the `Categories` table (`c`) and the `Suppliers` table (`s`) on their respective IDs. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all rows from the `Products` table are included in the output, even if there's no matching record in the other two tables.

- We're using the `COALESCE` function to replace any `NULL` values in the `Supplier_Name` column with 'No Supplier'.

- The final `WHERE` clause filters out products that have a stock quantity greater than 0.

Please note that this assumes that your table structure is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Categories (
  Category_ID INT,
  Category_Name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Suppliers (
  Supplier_Name VARCHAR(255),
  -- Other supplier fields...
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
  Product_Name VARCHAR(255),
  SKU VARCHAR(255),
  Stock_Quantity INT,
  Category INT,
  Supplier_Name VARCHAR(255),
  -- Other product fields...
);
```

Also, you would need to replace `Category` and `Supplier_Name` with the actual foreign key column names in your database schema.<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve all restaurant names from the "Restaurants" table and their corresponding cuisine information from the "CuisineList" table, but only include restaurants that have a matching cuisine even if it's located in multiple tables? The "Restaurants" table has the following structure:

| Restaurant Name | City |
| --- | --- |
| Burger Haven | New York |
| Sushi World | Los Angeles |
| Pasta Palace | Chicago |

The "CuisineList" table has the following structure and sample data:

| Restaurant Name | Cuisine |
| --- | --- |
| Burger Haven | Italian |
| Sushi World | Indian |
| Pasta Palace | Italian |
| Burger Haven | French |

Note that some restaurants, like "Burger Haven", appear in both tables with different cuisines. The query should return all restaurant names along with their corresponding cuisine from the "CuisineList" table if it exists, otherwise use a default cuisine value of 'Unknown'.<start>**SQL Query to Retrieve Restaurant Names and Corresponding Cuisine Information**
===========================================================

To achieve this, you can use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
  R.Restaurant_Name AS Restaurant_Name,
  COALESCE(CL.Cuisine, 'Unknown') AS Cuisine
FROM Restaurants R
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT 
    Restaurant_Name,
    MAX(Cuisine) AS Cuisine
  FROM CuisineList
  GROUP BY Restaurant_Name
) CL ON R.Restaurant_Name = CL.Restaurant_Name;
```
**Explanation**

1. The subquery selects the `Restaurant_Name` and maximum `Cuisine` from the `CuisineList` table for each restaurant, grouping by `Restaurant_Name`. This ensures that if a restaurant has multiple cuisines, only the most recent one is selected.
2. The outer query joins this result with the `Restaurants` table on the `Restaurant_Name` column.
3. The `COALESCE` function is used to return the cuisine value from the subquery if it exists (i.e., not null), otherwise defaulting to 'Unknown'.

**Example Use Case**

 Running this query against your sample data will produce the following result:

| Restaurant Name | Cuisine |
| --- | --- |
| Burger Haven | Italian |
| Sushi World | Indian |
| Pasta Palace | Italian |

Note that for "Burger Haven", only the 'Italian' cuisine is returned, as it's the most recent one in the `CuisineList` table.<end>

Here's a SQL problem that requires SELECT with an INNER JOIN:

What SQL query would you write to retrieve the title of each book in the "Fantasy" genre along with the average rating of all books written by the same author as the book "Legends of the Rift", which has an author named Orion Frostblade?<start>**SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT 
  b.title, 
  AVG(a.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM 
  books b
INNER JOIN 
  authors a ON b.author_id = a.id
WHERE 
  b.genre = 'Fantasy'
  AND b.author_name = (SELECT author_name FROM authors WHERE id = (SELECT author_id FROM books WHERE title = 'Legends of the Rift'))
GROUP BY 
  b.title;
```
**Explanation**

This query uses an INNER JOIN to combine the `books` and `authors` tables based on the `author_id`. We then filter the results to only include Fantasy genre books written by Orion Frostblade (the author of "Legends of the Rift").

The subquery in the WHERE clause retrieves the author ID of Orion Frostblade, which is used to join the authors table.

Finally, we group the results by book title and calculate the average rating using the AVG function.

**Example Use Case**

Suppose our database contains the following tables:

`books`:
```markdown
+----+----------+-----------+--------+
| id | title    | author_id | genre  |
+----+----------+-----------+--------+
| 1  | ToA      | 1         | Fantasy|
| 2  | LoTR     | 2         | Fantasy|
| 3  | LOTR     | 2         | Fantasy|
| 4  | GoT      | 3         | Fantasy|
+----+----------+-----------+--------+
```

`authors`:
```markdown
+----+------------+
| id | author_name|
+----+------------+
| 1  | Orion Frostblade |
| 2  | Aragorn     |
| 3  | Daenerys    |
+----+------------+
```

`ratings` (not shown in the query, but assumed to exist):
```markdown
+----+--------+------+
| id | book_id| rating|
+----+--------+------+
| 1  | 1      | 4.5   |
| 2  | 1      | 4.8   |
| 3  | 2      | 4.2   |
| 4  | 3      | 4.6   |
+----+--------+------+
```

Running the above query would return:
```markdown
+----------+------------+
| title    | avg_rating|
+----------+------------+
| ToA      | 4.65     |
| GoT      | null      |
+----------+------------+
```
Note that the average rating for "GoT" is NULL since there are no ratings available for that book written by Daenerys.<end>

What is a SQL query that returns all movies from both the "Movies" table and the "BoxOfficeEarnings" table, including movies with no earnings, even if they are not present in either table, matching on Title, and displaying columns Title, Genre, Release Year, and Box Office Earnings (M), where "Movies" is a table with the following structure:

| Movie ID | Title | Genre | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Final Voyage | Action | 1979 |
| 2 | Starbound Odyssey | Fantasy | 1987 |
| 3 | The Great Expedition | Comedy | 2000 |

and "BoxOfficeEarnings" is a table with the following structure:

| Movie ID | Box Office Earnings (M) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 884.85 |
| 4 | 614.88 |
| 5 | 973.99 |
| 6 | 190.54 |

assuming that columns from both tables have matching data types and there are no duplicate values in the Movie ID column of either table?<start>To return all movies with their box office earnings (or zero if they have no earnings), including movies with no earnings, even if they are not present in either table, we can use a SQL query that employs a full outer join. This type of join returns all records from both tables, with the missing values represented by NULL.

However, since you want to display the box office earnings for each movie (which is available only when the movie has earnings), and also want to show movies without earnings (for which it's zero), we actually need a different approach. We can use a `LEFT JOIN` for the "BoxOfficeEarnings" table onto the "Movies" table, but in our scenario since we are not looking at specific data from "Movies" that isn't available in "BoxOfficeEarnings", we'll actually be using a `RIGHT JOIN` to include movies with earnings and then left join back onto the "Movies" table to fill in missing Movie IDs. The final query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
  M.Title, 
  M.Genre, 
  M.Release Year AS ReleaseYear, 
  COALESCE(BOE.Box Office Earnings (M), 0) AS BoxOfficeEarnings
FROM Movies M
RIGHT JOIN (
  SELECT Movie ID, Box Office Earnings (M)
  FROM BoxOfficeEarnings
) BOE ON M.Movie ID = BOE.Movie ID
LEFT JOIN Movies M2 ON M.Title = M2.Title AND M.Genre = M2.Genre AND M.Release Year = M2.Release Year AND M.Movie ID <> M2.Movie ID;
```

However, the explanation above was overly complicated. The simple approach to achieve what you're asking is actually much more straightforward and typically involves using a `LEFT JOIN`. The query should look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
  M.Title, 
  M.Genre, 
  M.ReleaseYear,
  COALESCE(BOE.BoxOfficeEarnings, 0) AS BoxOfficeEarnings
FROM Movies M
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT Movie ID, Box Office Earnings (M)
  FROM BoxOfficeEarnings
) BOE ON M.MovieID = BOE.MovieID;
```

This query selects all the columns from `Movies` (`Title`, `Genre`, and `ReleaseYear`) and also includes the box office earnings for each movie. If a movie is in `Movies` but not in `BoxOfficeEarnings`, it will be included with its `BoxOfficeEarnings` set to 0 (since we use `COALESCE` which returns the first non-NULL value).<end>

What SQL query can I use to list all products that have a different supplier than at least one of their "comparable" products (i.e., products with the same SKU but a different product name), along with the respective prices and suppliers for both comparable products? 

Assuming we're working with two tables: `products` and `sku_prices`. The `products` table contains information about each product, including its name and supplier, while the `sku_prices` table stores the current price of each product. Both tables have a "Supplier Name" column that represents the company providing each product.

Table: products
| Product Name | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- |
| Thingamajig | Globex |
| Doohickey | Wonka Industries |
| Whatchamacallit | Globex |
| Doohickey | Globex |
| Gizmo | Wonka Industries |
| Gadget | Wayne Enterprises |

Table: sku_prices
| SKU | Product Name | Price | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SKU-1089 | Thingamajig | 80.83 | Globex |
| SKU-1088 | Doohickey | 350.97 | Wonka Industries |
| SKU-1096 | Whatchamacallit | 409.81 | Globex |
| SKU-1019 | Doohickey | 106.21 | Globex |
| SKU-1005 | Gizmo | 388.55 | Wonka Industries |
| SKU-1019 | Gadget | 62.05 | Wayne Enterprises |

Note: The above example data might not cover all cases that would be required to solve this problem; it only provides a starting point for the discussion.<start>To answer your question, we need to find products where there are multiple SKUs with different prices and suppliers.

Here is an SQL query that can help you achieve that:

```sql
WITH 
  comparable_products AS (
    SELECT 
      sku,
      supplier_name
    FROM 
      sku_prices sp
    GROUP BY 
      sku
    HAVING 
      COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) > 1 AND
      COUNT(DISTINCT price) > 1
  ),
  differing_supplier_products AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
      p.product_name,
      cp.sku,
      cp.supplier_name AS supplier_name_1,
      sp.price AS price_1,
      sp2.supplier_name AS supplier_name_2,
      sp2.price AS price_2
    FROM 
      products p
    JOIN 
      sku_prices sp ON p.product_name = sp.product_name AND p.sku = sp.SKU
    JOIN 
      comparable_products cp ON sp.sku = cp.sku
    JOIN 
      sku_prices sp2 ON p.product_name != sp.product_name AND p.sku = sp2.SKU
  )
SELECT * FROM differing_supplier_products;
```

This query first identifies the SKUs with multiple products and prices in the `comparable_products` CTE. Then it joins this result with the main tables to get all products that have a different supplier than at least one of their "comparable" products, along with the respective prices and suppliers for both comparable products.

The final query will show you which product names are associated with multiple SKUs that have different suppliers and prices.

Note: This SQL solution assumes that there is only one set of differing suppliers per product SKU. If this assumption does not hold for your data then a more complex approach would be necessary.<end>

What SQL query would retrieve the names of all authors in the "authors" table who have a rating that contains the word '2' regardless of its position in the rating string? 

Table: authors
| Author | Rating |
| --- | --- |
| Kara Firebrand | 2.2 |
| Galen Starfire | 4.5 |
| Draven Blackthorn | 4.8 |
| Thorne Ironwood | 1.2 |
| Luna Silverleaf | 2.2 |
| Draven Blackthorn | 3.1 |
| Elara Moonshadow | 1.9 |<start>Here is the SQL query that retrieves the names of all authors who have a rating containing the word '2':

```sql
SELECT Author
FROM authors
WHERE Rating LIKE '%2%';
```

This query works by using the `LIKE` operator with a wildcard (`%`) to search for any string that contains '2'. The `%` symbol is a special character in SQL that matches any sequence of characters (including none). By placing it on either side of '2', we can search for '2' anywhere within the rating string.

Note: This query will return duplicate author names if there are multiple ratings containing the word '2' for the same author. If you want to avoid duplicates, you can use a `DISTINCT` keyword:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Author
FROM authors
WHERE Rating LIKE '%2%';
```

This will ensure that each unique author name is returned only once, even if there are multiple ratings containing the word '2' for them.<end>

What SQL query would return the Product Name of all products that have a Stock Quantity is NULL in the Inventory table, where the SKU is also present in the OrderDetails table as the OrderID?<start>Here is the SQL query that should accomplish what you're asking:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.ProductName
FROM Products p
JOIN Inventory i ON p.SKU = i.SKU
WHERE i.StockQuantity IS NULL 
  AND i.SKU IN (SELECT OrderID FROM OrderDetails);
```

This query works by joining the `Products` table with the `Inventory` table on the SKU column, and then filtering for rows where the stock quantity is null. The final condition filters to only include SKUs that are present in the `OrderDetails` table.

Note: This assumes that your database schema has the following structure:

- `Products`: 
  - `SKU` (unique identifier)
  - `ProductName`

- `Inventory`: 
  - `SKU`
  - `StockQuantity`

- `OrderDetails`: 
  - `OrderID`

If your column names are different, you'll need to replace them with the actual names in your database.<end>

What SQL query would return a list of restaurants that have a price range and are rated at least 4 stars, but exclude restaurants with no rating (i.e., restaurants that only have a price range)? The "Restaurant" table contains all the relevant data.

| Cuisine | Rating | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Indian | 3 | $$ |
| American | 5 | $$$$$ |
| French | 1 | $$$ |
| Mexican | 5 | $$$$$ |
| French | 3 | $$$ |

Note: Assume a rating of 4 or higher indicates the restaurant has been rated.<start>**SQL Query to Retrieve Rated Restaurants**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Restaurant
WHERE Rating >= 4 AND Price_Range IS NOT NULL;
```

This query filters out restaurants that have not been rated (i.e., those with a `NULL` rating) and also excludes restaurants with only a price range, but no rating.

**Explanation:**

* The `Rating >= 4` condition ensures we only retrieve restaurants with a minimum of 4-star ratings.
* The `Price_Range IS NOT NULL` condition eliminates rows where the price range is unknown or undefined (i.e., `NULL`).

By applying both conditions, this query will return a list of restaurants that have been rated at least 4 stars and also provide a price range.

**Example Use Case:**

Assuming you have a table called "Restaurant" with the sample data provided:

| Cuisine | Rating | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Indian | 3 | $$ |
| American | 5 | $$$$$ |
| French | 1 | $$$ |
| Mexican | 5 | $$$$$ |
| French | 3 | $$$ |

Running this query will return the following result:

| Cuisine | Rating | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| American | 5 | $$$$$ |
| Mexican | 5 | $$$$$ |
| Indian | 3 | $$ |

These are the restaurants that have been rated at least 4 stars and also provide a price range. The French restaurant with only a rating of 1 is excluded because it has no price range, even though it has been rated.<end>

What SQL query would return all movie genres that have an average rating greater than or equal to 3.5 from a table named "Movies" with columns Title, Genre, Publication Year, and Rating, where the ratings are calculated based on the year of publication for each genre? The movies table is as follows:

| Title | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Crystal Key | Horror | 2016 | 1.2 |
| The Forgotten World | Mystery | 1963 | 1.5 |
| The Silent Grove | Science Fiction | 2005 | 3.4 |
| The Crystal Key | Thriller | 2012 | 3.3 |
| Shadows of Solitude | Non-Fiction | 2002 | 1.5 |
| The Forgotten World | Science Fiction | 1999 | 5.0 |
| Shadows of Solitude | Thriller | 2006 | 2.3 |
| Shadows of Solitude | Horror | 2012 | 3.4 |

Note: To calculate the average rating for each genre, you would need to use a subquery or join with the Movies table based on the Genre column.<start>To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query that involves grouping by the Genre column and calculating the average Rating for each group (genre). We then filter these averages to only include those greater than or equal to 3.5.

Here's how you could write such a query:

```sql
SELECT 
    M.Genre,
    AVG(M.Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM 
    Movies M
GROUP BY 
    M.Genre
HAVING 
    AVG(M.Rating) >= 3.5;
```

This SQL query does the following:
- Selects all rows from the `Movies` table.
- Groups these rows by the `Genre` column, effectively calculating an average rating for each genre.
- Filters out any genres with an average rating less than 3.5 using a HAVING clause.

However, if you want to return specific columns like the Genre name and its corresponding Average Rating (not just the averages), you can modify it slightly:

```sql
SELECT 
    M.Genre,
    AVG(M.Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM 
    Movies M
GROUP BY 
    M.Genre
HAVING 
    AVG(M.Rating) >= 3.5;
```

But if you want to see all genres, even those that don't have an average rating of at least 3.5 (you might also want the ones with no movies), it's better to first select the genres and their averages, then filter the results:

```sql
SELECT 
    Genre,
    Average_Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Genre,
        AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating
    FROM 
        Movies
    GROUP BY 
        Genre
) AS Movie_Genres_Avg
WHERE 
    Average_Rating >= 3.5;
```

This approach allows you to see all genres, whether they have an average rating of at least 3.5 or not.<end>

Here's a potential SQL problem that requires SELECT with an OVER window function:

What is the ranking of restaurants by their average rating per location, but only for each location? I'd like to have two columns: one showing the location and another showing its corresponding rank among all locations.

The relevant table details are as follows:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Restaurants (
  Restaurant_Name VARCHAR(255),
  Cuisine VARCHAR(255),
  Location VARCHAR(255),
  Rating INT,
  Price_Range VARCHAR(10)
);

INSERT INTO Restaurants (Restaurant_Name, Cuisine, Location, Rating, Price_Range) 
VALUES ('Pizza Planet', 'Japanese', 'Roseville, California', 1, '$$$'),
       ('Curry Corner', 'Japanese', 'Round Rock, Texas', 4, '$$$'),
       ('BBQ Barn', 'Japanese', 'Aurora, Illinois', 2, '$$$$$'),
       ('Sushi World', 'Mexican', 'Macon, Georgia', 4, '$'),
       ('Vegan Delight', 'American', 'Simi Valley, California', 3, '$$$'),
       ('Pizza Planet', 'American', 'Portland, Oregon', 1, '$$$$');
```
Note that this table contains restaurants with different cuisines and locations, but some locations have multiple restaurants. The goal is to rank each location based on its average rating across all restaurants in the same location.<start>Here's a SQL query using the `OVER` window function that solves your problem:

```sql
SELECT 
  Location,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG_Rating DESC) as Rank,
  AVG_Rating
FROM (
  SELECT 
    Location,
    AVG(Rating) as AVG_Rating
  FROM Restaurants
  GROUP BY Location
) AS T
```
Let me explain how this query works:

1. First, we're grouping the restaurants by their `Location`. This will give us an average rating per location.

2. We then select the `Location` and its corresponding `AVG_Rating`.

3. The `DENSE_RANK()` function assigns a ranking to each group based on its average rating in descending order (i.e., highest rated locations get rank 1, next highest gets rank 2, etc.). If there are ties, this function will assign the same rank and increment the next distinct rank.

4. We then use the `OVER` clause to specify that we want to calculate the ranking per group based on the average rating in descending order.

However, note that if two locations have the same average rating, they'll be assigned the same rank (let's say 1), but the next location will get a rank of 3. This is because `DENSE_RANK()` skips ranks when there are ties.

For your example data, this query would return something like:

```markdown
+------------------------+------+-------------+
| Location                | Rank | AVG_Rating |
+------------------------+------+-------------+
| Roseville, California    | 1   |            1|
| Round Rock, Texas        | 2   |            4|
| Aurora, Illinois        | 3   |            2|
| Macon, Georgia           | 4   |            4|
| Simi Valley, California  | 5   |            3|
| Portland, Oregon         | 6   |            1|
+------------------------+------+-------------+
```<end>

What is the average price of products from each supplier, along with the supplier's name and the difference in stock quantity compared to the previous product from the same supplier? 

Table: Product_Info
| Product Name | SKU | Price | Stock Quantity | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contraption | SKU-1025 | 292.7 | 211 | ACME Corp |
| Whatchamacallit | SKU-1067 | 42.42 | 144 | ACME Corp |
| Instrument | SKU-1014 | 478.81 | 411 | Wayne Enterprises |
| Doohickey | SKU-1044 | 17.47 | 405 | Wayne Enterprises |
| Gadget | SKU-1079 | 341.72 | 487 | Umbrella Corp |
| Widget | SKU-1010 | 408.03 | 66 | Globex |
| Apparatus | SKU-1070 | 374.15 | 200 | Wayne Enterprises |

Table: Suppliers
| Supplier ID | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | ACME Corp |
| 2 | Wayne Enterprises |
| 3 | Umbrella Corp |
| 4 | Globex |

Note: The LAG function will be used to compare the stock quantity of each product with the previous product from the same supplier. If there is no previous product, it should return NULL for the difference in stock quantity.<start>Here are the results:

**ACME Corp**

| Supplier Name | Average Price | Stock Quantity Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACME Corp | 167.555 (avg of 292.7 and 42.42) | Contraption: `211`, Whatchamacallit: `144` (difference: `-67`) |

**Wayne Enterprises**

| Supplier Name | Average Price | Stock Quantity Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wayne Enterprises | 310.695 (avg of 478.81 and 17.47) | Instrument: `411`, Doohickey: `405` (difference: `-6`) Apparatus: `200` (difference: `-205` from previous product) |

**Umbrella Corp**

| Supplier Name | Average Price | Stock Quantity Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Umbrella Corp | 341.72 | Gadget: `487`, NULL for stock quantity difference since there's no previous product |

**Globex**

| Supplier Name | Average Price | Stock Quantity Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Globex | 408.03 | Widget: `66`, NULL for stock quantity difference since there's no previous product |

Note that the stock quantity difference is calculated as `previous_stock - current_stock`. If there is no previous product, it returns `NULL` for the stock quantity difference.

Here are the SQL queries to get these results:
```sql
SELECT 
  SupplierName,
  AVG(Price) AS Average_Price,
  LAG(StockQuantity) OVER (PARTITION BY SupplierName ORDER BY ProductName) - StockQuantity AS Stock_Qty_Diff
FROM 
  Product_Info
GROUP BY 
  SupplierName;
```
Then, to get the individual product results:
```sql
SELECT 
  Product_Name,
  Price,
  Stock_Quantity,
  LAG(StockQuantity) OVER (PARTITION BY SupplierName ORDER BY ProductName) - Stock_Quantity AS Stock_Qty_Diff
FROM 
  Product_Info;
```<end>

Here's an example SQL problem:

What is the average latency (ms) for each database in the table 'Database Performance' where the cache hit ratio (%) exceeds 80%? 

Assuming the relevant columns and tables are as follows:
```sql
CREATE TABLE DatabasePerformance (
  `Database Name` VARCHAR(255),
  `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` DECIMAL(5,2),
  `Connection Count` INT,
  `Average Latency (ms)` DECIMAL(4,2)
);

INSERT INTO DatabasePerformance (`Database Name`, `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`, `Connection Count`, `Average Latency (ms)`)
VALUES
('OrdersDB', 77.57, 425, 20.57),
('InventoryDB', 99.34, 487, 5.25),
('ProfilesDB', 75.7, 172, 43.42),
('ProductsDB', 77.57, 379, 66.57),
('UserDB', 73.48, 76, 39.6),
('AnalyticsDB', 87.75, 19, 42.72);
```
The programmer would like to use the LEAD function in a SELECT statement to solve this problem and find out how the average latency of each database compares to the next one in the table ordered by cache hit ratio percentage in descending order.<start>To solve this problem using the `LEAD` function, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  `Database Name`,
  `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
  `Average Latency (ms)`,
  LEAD(`Average Latency (ms)`, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` DESC)
FROM DatabasePerformance
WHERE `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` > 80;
```

However, the above query doesn't solve the problem as it requires calculating the average latency for each database and then comparing it to the next one in the table ordered by cache hit ratio percentage.

Here's an updated query that calculates the average latency for each database and uses `LEAD` to compare it with the next one:

```sql
WITH RankedDBs AS (
  SELECT 
    `Database Name`,
    `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
    `Average Latency (ms)`,
    AVG(`Average Latency (ms)`) OVER (PARTITION BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` ORDER BY `Average Latency (ms)` DESC) AS AverageLatency
  FROM DatabasePerformance
  WHERE `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` > 80
)
SELECT 
  `Database Name`,
  `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
  `Average Latency (ms)`,
  AverageLatency,
  LEAD(AverageLatency, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` DESC)
FROM RankedDBs;
```

In this query, we're using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RankedDBs`. In the first subquery of the CTE, we calculate the average latency for each database and rank them by their cache hit ratio in descending order. We then use another subquery to apply the `LEAD` function on this ranked data.

However, using a self-join would be more efficient here:

```sql
WITH RankedDBs AS (
  SELECT 
    `Database Name`,
    `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
    `Average Latency (ms)`,
    AVG(`Average Latency (ms)`) OVER (PARTITION BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` ORDER BY `Average Latency (ms)` DESC) AS AverageLatency
  FROM DatabasePerformance
  WHERE `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` > 80
)
SELECT 
  A.`Database Name`,
  A.`Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
  A.`Average Latency (ms)`,
  A.AverageLatency,
  B.AverageLatency as NextDB_AvgLatency
FROM RankedDBs A
JOIN RankedDBs B ON A.`Cache Hit Ratio (%)` = B.`Cache Hit Ratio (%)` - 1;
```

This query joins the `RankedDBs` CTE with itself on the condition that the cache hit ratio of the first instance is one percentage point lower than the second instance, effectively comparing each database's average latency to the next one in the table ordered by cache hit ratio percentage. 

However, we need to consider cases where there are consecutive databases with identical or nearly identical (`Cache Hit Ratio (%)` values). In such scenarios, the above query will return multiple rows for each of these 'consecutive' instances.

The `LEAD` function can also be used directly on a subquery that first calculates the average latency for each database. 

Here's an example using `ROW_NUMBER()` and the self-join method:

```sql
WITH RankedDBs AS (
  SELECT 
    `Database Name`,
    `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
    `Average Latency (ms)`,
    AVG(`Average Latency (ms)`) OVER (PARTITION BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` ORDER BY `Average Latency (ms)` DESC) AS AverageLatency,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` DESC) as row_num
  FROM DatabasePerformance
  WHERE `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` > 80
)
SELECT 
  A.`Database Name`,
  A.`Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
  A.`Average Latency (ms)`,
  A.AverageLatency,
  B.AverageLatency as NextDB_AvgLatency
FROM RankedDBs A
JOIN RankedDBs B ON A.row_num = B.row_num + 1;
```

In this query, the `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique row number to each instance in descending order of cache hit ratio. The self-join then compares each database's average latency with the next one in the table ordered by cache hit ratio percentage.

This solution will provide accurate results even when there are consecutive databases with identical or nearly identical (`Cache Hit Ratio (%)` values).

In any case, if we have millions of rows, it would be more efficient to write this data into a temporary table and then perform our operations on that temporary table. Here is an example:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the temporary table.

CREATE TABLE temp_db_performance AS 
SELECT `Database Name`,
       `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` ,
       `Average Latency (ms)`
FROM DatabasePerformance;

-- Step 2: Add a column for average latency.
ALTER TABLE temp_db_performance ADD COLUMN AverageLatency DECIMAL(4,2);

-- Step 3: Insert the average of each group into this table.

INSERT INTO temp_db_performance
SELECT 
  `Database Name`,
  `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
  AVG(`Average Latency (ms)`) AS AverageLatency,
FROM DatabasePerformance
WHERE `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` > 80
GROUP BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`;

-- Step 4: Add a column to indicate the position of the row in sorted order.

ALTER TABLE temp_db_performance ADD COLUMN Pos INT;

-- Step 5: Update this field.
UPDATE temp_db_performance SET Pos = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM temp_db_performance WHERE `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` < temp_db_performance.`Cache Hit Ratio (%)`) + 1;

-- Step 6: Select the results from the temporary table.

SELECT 
  `Database Name`,
  `Cache Hit Ratio (%)`,
  `Average Latency (ms)`,
  AverageLatency,
  LEAD(AverageLatency, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` DESC)
FROM temp_db_performance
ORDER BY `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` DESC;
```

However, there might be some slight variations depending on the exact requirements of your project and any special considerations you need to make. For instance, you could change how rows are assigned their positions in sorted order or how differences between average latency values across groups are calculated.

This is just one example solution that has been adapted for this specific scenario. In practice, the optimal approach will depend on the nuances of your data and any special requirements you need to accommodate.<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve all rows from the `device_readings` table where the `Battery Level (%)` is below 40 and order them by the `Timestamp` in ascending order? 

The `device_readings` table contains the following columns:
| Device ID | Device Type | Location | Battery Level (%) | Reading Value | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| device-0004 | Pressure Sensor | Bathroom | 37.7 | -11.4 | 2021-03-06 22:48:55 |
| device-0073 | Motion Detector | Bathroom | 95.2 | 49.4 | 2021-08-11 17:30:49 |
| device-0043 | Pressure Sensor | Bedroom | 23.5 | 40.89 | 2022-10-03 18:43:43 |
| device-0040 | Humidity Sensor | Kitchen | 84.5 | 82.99 | 2023-11-14 11:25:43 |
| device-0009 | Humidity Sensor | Living Room | 21.4 | 4.01 | 2021-10-08 04:47:52 |

Assuming the table structure is:
```sql
CREATE TABLE device_readings (
  Device ID VARCHAR(20),
  Device Type VARCHAR(50),
  Location VARCHAR(100),
  Battery Level (%) DECIMAL(5,2),
  Reading Value DECIMAL(5,3),
  Timestamp DATETIME
);
```
The expected result should be all rows where `Battery Level (%)` is below 40 and sorted by the `Timestamp` in ascending order.<start>To retrieve the required data from the `device_readings` table using SQL, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM device_readings
WHERE Battery Level (%) < 40
ORDER BY Timestamp ASC;
```

However, it's worth noting that you should specify the column name correctly in your WHERE clause. In this case, we're assuming the column name is exactly as shown (`Battery Level (%)`). If there are spaces around the percent sign (like `Battery Level %`), you'd need to include those for it to work properly.

Here's how the query works:

1. `SELECT *`: This selects all columns from the table. If you only wanted specific columns, you would list them here instead of using `*`.

2. `FROM device_readings`: Specifies that we are selecting data from the `device_readings` table.

3. `WHERE Battery Level (%) < 40`: Filters the results to include rows where the `Battery Level (%)` is less than 40.

4. `ORDER BY Timestamp ASC`: Orders the filtered results in ascending order based on the `Timestamp`.

Remember, SQL syntax can be sensitive to spaces and case (e.g., MySQL vs PostgreSQL might behave differently). Always check your database management system's documentation for specifics if you're unsure about syntax.<end>

What is the average rating of books in each genre where the publication year is earlier than 2000? The table "books" contains information about the publications:

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Echoes of Eternity | Thorne Ironwood | Science Fiction | 1951 | 1.5 |
| Tales of the Brave | Galen Starfire | Horror | 1951 | 1.7 |
| The Last Sky | Luna Silverleaf | Science Fiction | 2022 | 3.7 |
| Whispers of the Abyss | Kara Firebrand | Horror | 1992 | 4.4 |
| The Last Sky | Elara Moonshadow | Mystery | 2010 | 1.8 |
| A Journey Through Time | Elara Moonshadow | Historical | 1995 | 4.7 |
| Legends of the Rift | Thorne Ironwood | Thriller | 1993 | 1.1 |<start>To solve this problem, we need to filter out books where the publication year is earlier than 2000 and then calculate the average rating for each genre.

First, let's filter out the books with a publication year of 1951 or later but before 2000:

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tales of the Brave | Galen Starfire | Horror | 1951 | 1.7 |
| Whispers of the Abyss | Kara Firebrand | Horror | 1992 | 4.4 |
| Legends of the Rift | Thorne Ironwood | Thriller | 1993 | 1.1 |
| A Journey Through Time | Elara Moonshadow | Historical | 1995 | 4.7 |

Next, let's group the books by genre and calculate the average rating for each genre:

- Horror: (Whispers of the Abyss (4.4) + Tales of the Brave (1.7)) / 2 = 3.05
- Thriller: Legends of the Rift (1.1)
- Historical: A Journey Through Time (4.7)

Since there's only one book in each genre, we can consider these ratings as individual averages. If you need to calculate an overall average for a specific genre with multiple books, it would be necessary to add up all the ratings and divide by the total number of books.

The final answer is: 
For Horror: $\boxed{3.05}$
For Thriller: $\boxed{1.1}$
For Historical: $\boxed{4.7}$<end>

What SQL query would I need to write in order to drop the "AnalyticsDB" table from a database, assuming it currently has the following data and schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE AnalyticsData (
    DatabaseName VARCHAR(255),
    CacheHitRatio DECIMAL(5, 2),
    ConnectionCount INT,
    AverageLatency DECIMAL(4, 2),
    Timestamp DATE
);

INSERT INTO AnalyticsData (DatabaseName, CacheHitRatio, ConnectionCount, AverageLatency, Timestamp)
VALUES 
('AnalyticsDB', 77.37, 39, 73.45, '2022-12-27 00:11:31'),
('AnalyticsDB', 91.63, 355, 16.83, '2022-12-10 21:37:20');
```

The "AnalyticsData" table contains information about the database performance of different systems with columns for DatabaseName, CacheHitRatio, ConnectionCount, AverageLatency, and Timestamp. I want to drop this entire table from my current database, including all its rows.<start>To drop the entire `AnalyticsDB` table, you can use a simple `DROP TABLE` SQL query:

```sql
DROP TABLE AnalyticsData;
```

Note that you don't need to specify the database name (`AnalyticsDB`) when dropping the table, as it's already defined within the table itself.

By running this query, all rows and columns of the `AnalyticsData` table will be removed from your database. **Be careful with this query**, as once executed, there's no going back – the data is permanently deleted!<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires INSERT:

What is the correct way to insert a new reading for the device with ID "device-0010" located in the "Bedroom", with a battery level of 92.1%, and a reading value of -27.41, into the "Devices_Readings" table?

The Devices_Readings table has the following columns:

| Device ID | Location | Battery Level (%) | Reading Value | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Note: The timestamp should be set to the current date and time when the insert operation is executed.<start>Here's a correct way to insert the new reading into the "Devices_Readings" table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Devices_Readings (Device_ID, Location, Battery_Level (%), Reading_Value, Timestamp)
VALUES ('device-0010', 'Bedroom', 92.1, -27.41, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```

Or, if your SQL dialect uses backticks for column names and allows specifying the current timestamp without an explicit function:

```sql
INSERT INTO `Devices_Readings` (`Device_ID`, `Location`, `Battery_Level (%)`, `Reading_Value`, `Timestamp`)
VALUES ('device-0010', 'Bedroom', 92.1, -27.41, NOW());
```

However, the most common way to do this would be using named parameters which allows for more flexibility and maintainability of your SQL code:

```sql
INSERT INTO Devices_Readings (Device_ID, Location, Battery_Level, Reading_Value, Timestamp)
VALUES ('device-0010', 'Bedroom', 92.1, -27.41, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```

The key things here are that we match the columns from the table with the values being inserted and use the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` or `NOW()` function to get the current date and time.

Remember to replace `'device-0010'`, `'Bedroom'`, `-27.41`, and `92.1` with your actual data when running this query.<end>

What SQL query would you use to delete all restaurant records where the price range is below $$ and there is already a record for that same restaurant with a higher price range? 

Assuming the relevant table name is "Restaurants" with the following columns:

| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| Restaurant ID (Primary Key) | INT |
| Restaurant Name | VARCHAR(255) |
| Cuisine | VARCHAR(50) |
| Location | VARCHAR(100) |
| Price Range | VARCHAR(5) |

Example data in the "Restaurants" table:

| Restaurant ID | Restaurant Name | Cuisine | Location | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1            | The Steakhouse | American | Baton Rouge, Louisiana | $$$$$     |
| 2            | Curry Corner   | Italian    | Highland, California | $$$$      |
| 3            | Pasta Palace  | Chinese    | Pompano Beach, Florida | $$$$      |
| 4            | Pizza Planet  | Chinese    | Conway, Arkansas    | $$        |
| 5            | Taco Town     | Japanese   | Shreveport, Louisiana | $$$$      |
| 6            | Pizza Planet  | Indian     | Rochester, Minnesota | $         |<start>Here is the SQL query that deletes all restaurant records where the price range is below $$ and there is already a record for that same restaurant with a higher price range:
```sql
DELETE r1
FROM Restaurants r1
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT RestaurantName, MAX(PriceRange) AS HighestPriceRange
  FROM Restaurants
  GROUP BY RestaurantName
) r2 ON r1.RestaurantName = r2.RestaurantName AND r1.PriceRange != r2.HighestPriceRange AND CAST(REPLACE(r1.PriceRange, '$', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 0)) < 5;
```
Here's how the query works:

1. The subquery selects each restaurant name and its highest price range using `MAX(PriceRange)` and groups by restaurant name.
2. The main query joins this result to the original table on the condition that the current price range is not equal to the highest price range, and the numeric value of the current price range (with dollar signs removed) is less than 5 (i.e., below $$).
3. The `DELETE` statement then deletes all rows from the joined table where these conditions are met.

Note: This query assumes that you want to delete records with a price range of "$$" exactly, not just any price range less than $$. If you want to match any price range less than $$$ (i.e., $$, $, or $), modify the subquery's condition to `CAST(REPLACE(r1.PriceRange, '$', '') AS DECIMAL(10, 0)) <= 3`.<end>

What is the best way to update the Battery Level (%) of all devices that have a Reading Value greater than 50 in the Devices table? The Devices table structure is as follows:

Devices
| Device Type | Battery Level (%) | Reading Value | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Temperature Sensor | 91.3 | 52.91 | 2022-10-02 07:40:02 |
| Pressure Sensor | 50.6 | -1.07 | 2022-11-24 16:40:15 |
| Humidity Sensor | 95.1 | -10.6 | 2022-04-26 14:58:29 |
| Light Sensor | 84.3 | 53.23 | 2023-09-01 17:54:14 |
| Light Sensor | 15.9 | 14.97 | 2023-03-25 23:21:38 |
| Light Sensor | 82.6 | 53.23 | 2022-09-18 01:23:08 |

However, the Battery Level (%) for devices of type 'Light Sensor' should only be updated to a maximum of 80, whereas other devices can have their battery levels updated to a maximum of 90.<start>You can achieve this by using an UPDATE statement with a WHERE clause that filters the rows based on the device type and reading value condition. Here is a sample SQL code for this:

```sql
UPDATE Devices 
SET Battery Level (%) = CASE 
    WHEN Device Type = 'Light Sensor' THEN COALESCE((Battery Level (%)) + 30, 80)
    ELSE COALESCE((Battery Level (%)) + 40, 90)
END 
WHERE Device Type IN ('Temperature Sensor', 'Pressure Sensor', 'Humidity Sensor') AND Reading Value > 50;
```

However, this will not work as written because SQL syntax does not allow `+` to be used directly with numbers and a column name. We can use the `COALESCE` function in combination with arithmetic expressions involving the values from the table itself to get around this limitation.

The COALESCE function returns the first argument if it is NOT NULL, or the second argument if the first is NULL. By using the battery level value as one of the arguments and a default (the "maximum allowed") value as the other argument, we can achieve an equivalent result:

```sql
UPDATE Devices 
SET Battery Level (%) = CASE 
    WHEN Device Type = 'Light Sensor' THEN COALESCE(Battery Level (%), 80) + 30 - COALESCE(Battery Level (%), 0)
    ELSE COALESCE(Battery Level (%), 90) + 40 - COALESCE(Battery Level (%), 0)
END 
WHERE Device Type IN ('Temperature Sensor', 'Pressure Sensor', 'Humidity Sensor') AND Reading Value > 50;
```

In this example, for Light Sensors, `COALESCE(Battery Level (%), 80)` will return the current battery level if it is less than or equal to 80 and otherwise returns 80. Similarly, `COALESCE(Battery Level (%), 90)` will work as expected.

This SQL statement should update all 'Light Sensor' devices whose battery level is currently below 80 to a level of 80 (the maximum allowed) and all other devices whose reading value is greater than 50 to a level of either 90 or less if the current level exceeds 90.<end>

What SQL query should I use to create a database table called "Drivers" that stores information about individual drivers who transport fuel tankers across the country, with the following requirements:

- The table must have columns for: "Driver ID", "Name", "Total Fuel Transported (gallons)", and "Number of Trips"
- A separate table called "Trips" already exists in the database and contains information about each trip, including trip name, distance traveled, duration, and fuel used.
- I want to use a foreign key in the "Drivers" table that references the "Trip Name" column in the existing "Trips" table to establish a relationship between the two tables.
- The "Total Fuel Transported (gallons)" column should be automatically updated when a new trip is added and should reflect the sum of fuel used in all trips taken by each driver.

Example data for the "Drivers" table:

| Driver ID | Name | Total Fuel Transported (gallons) | Number of Trips |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D001 | John Smith | 0.00 | 0 |
| D002 | Jane Doe | 0.00 | 0 |

Example data for the existing "Trips" table:

| Trip Name | Distance (miles) | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canyon Trek | 2274.7 | 34.9 | 62.4 |
| Coast to Coast | 909.6 | 42.3 | 99.0 |
| Historic Route | 1270.5 | 71.2 | 8.0 |

What SQL query should I use to create the "Drivers" table with the required columns and relationship to the existing "Trips" table?<start>To create the `Drivers` table with a foreign key referencing the `Trip Name` column in the existing `Trips` table, you can use the following SQL query:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Drivers (
  Driver_ID VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Fuel_Transported DECIMAL(10, 2),
  Number_of_Trips INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  Trip_Name VARCHAR(100),
  CONSTRAINT fk_Driver_Trip FOREIGN KEY (Trip_Name) REFERENCES Trips(Trip_Name)
);

ALTER TABLE Drivers ADD COLUMN Driver_ID VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY;
```
However, this query is not ideal because it includes a column named `Driver ID` which is equivalent to the primary key of the table. To correctly create the table with columns for "Driver ID", "Name", and "Total Fuel Transported (gallons)", along with a foreign key referencing the existing `Trips` table, you can use the following SQL query:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Drivers (
  Driver_ID VARCHAR(10),
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Fuel_Transported DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,
  Number_of_Trips INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  Trip_Name VARCHAR(100)
);

ALTER TABLE Drivers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_Driver_Trip FOREIGN KEY (Trip_Name) REFERENCES Trips(Trip_Name);
```
The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to add the foreign key constraint after creating the table.

**Note**: The data types and sizes specified for each column are examples and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements. Additionally, this query assumes that the `Trip Name` column in the existing `Trips` table is a string type (e.g., VARCHAR). If it's an integer or another data type, you'll need to modify the foreign key constraint accordingly.

With these queries, you'll have a `Drivers` table with the required columns and relationships to the existing `Trips` table. The `Total Fuel Transported (gallons)` column will be updated automatically when a new trip is added by referencing the `Fuel Used` column in the `Trips` table using the foreign key.

**Trigger Example**

To update the `Total_Fuel_Transported` column of each driver whenever a new trip is inserted into the `Trips` table, you can create an after-insert trigger on the `Trips` table:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER Update_Driver_Total_Fuel_Transported
AFTER INSERT ON Trips FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE Drivers
  SET Total_Fuel_Transported = Total_Fuel_Transported + (SELECT Fuel_Used FROM inserted)
  WHERE Trip_Name = NEW.Trip_Name;
END;
```
This trigger updates the `Total_Fuel_Transported` column of each driver who took part in the newly added trip by adding the fuel used during that trip.<end>

What SQL command would I use to add a new column called 'Change in Price' that calculates the difference between the Close Price and Open Price, rounding the result to two decimal places, to the 'StockPrices' table? 

The StockPrices table already has columns for Company, Date, Open Price, Close Price, High Price, Low Price, and Volume.<start>You can use the following SQL command to add a new column called 'Change in Price' to the 'StockPrices' table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE StockPrices 
ADD Change_in_Price DECIMAL(10, 2);

UPDATE StockPrices 
SET Change_in_Price = ROUND(Close_Price - Open_Price, 2);
```

However, if you don't want to store the calculated values in the database but rather display them on demand (which is generally recommended for performance reasons), you can use a SQL view or a computed column.

**Using a Computed Column:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE StockPrices 
ADD Change_in_Price AS ROUND(Close_Price - Open_Price, 2) PERSISTED;
```

This approach will update the calculated value whenever the Close_Price or Open_Price values are updated. The `PERSISTED` keyword tells MySQL to store the computed column in a way that is optimized for queries.

**Using a View:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW StockPricesWithChange AS 
SELECT Company, Date, Open_Price, Close_Price, High_Price, Low_Price, Volume, ROUND(Close_Price - Open_Price, 2) AS Change_in_Price 
FROM StockPrices;
```

This will create a new view called `StockPricesWithChange` that includes the calculated column. You can query this view instead of the original table to include the calculated values.

**Using Window Function:**

If your database system supports window functions (such as PostgreSQL, Oracle), you could use an UPDATE statement with a subquery like so:

```sql
UPDATE StockPrices 
SET Change_in_Price = (
  SELECT ROUND(Close_Price - Open_Price, 2) 
  FROM (SELECT Close_Price, Open_Price, ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS row_num 
        FROM StockPrices) AS temp 
  WHERE temp.row_num = StockPrices.row_num);
```

Note that this is a more complex and potentially slower approach.

Please adjust the above commands according to your SQL dialect.<end>

What SQL query would retrieve all the movies (regardless of genre) from the "Movies" table that were released before or in the year 2000 and have a release year that is also present in the "Genre_Overview" table? The "Movies" table has the following structure:
| Movie ID | Title | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1        | The Final Voyage    | 2011     |
| 2        | Starbound Odyssey   | 1991     |
| 3        | Mystery of the Depths| 2005     |
| 4        | Mystery of the Depths| 1997     |
| 5        | Rise of the Titans   | 1974     |
| 6        | Edge of Infinity    | 1974     |
| 7        | The Great Expedition | 1992     |

The "Genre_Overview" table has the following structure:
| Genre ID | Genre Name | Release Year Min | Release Year Max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1       | Horror      | 1980          | 2020           |
| 2       | Fantasy     | 1995          | 2015           |
| 3       | Action      | 1970          | 2000           |
| 4       | Sci-Fi      | 1960          | 1980           |

The "Movies" table has a foreign key to the "Genre_Overview" table, specifically the release year in the "Movies" table must be within or equal to the range of the corresponding genre in the "Genre_Overview" table.<start>To solve this problem, we need to combine two conditions:

1. The movie's release year should be before or equal to 2000.
2. The movie's release year should be present in the "Release Year Min" and/or "Release Year Max" column of the "Genre_Overview" table.

The SQL query can be as follows:
```sql
SELECT m.*
FROM Movies m
JOIN Genre_Overview g ON m.Release_Year BETWEEN g.Release_Yr_Min AND g.Release_Yr_Max
WHERE m.Release_Year <= 2000;
```
This will return all the movies that meet both conditions. Note that we're using a JOIN to combine the "Movies" and "Genre_Overview" tables based on the release year, which must fall within the range specified in the "Genre_Overview" table.

**Explanation**

* The `BETWEEN` operator is used to filter rows where the movie's release year falls within the specified range.
* Since we're only interested in movies released before or in 2000, we use the condition `m.Release_Year <= 2000`.
* The JOIN operation combines the "Movies" and "Genre_Overview" tables based on the matching release years. If a movie's release year is present in both the "Release Year Min" and/or "Release Year Max" column of the "Genre_Overview" table, it will be included in the result set.

**Example use case**

Suppose we have the following data:

Movies:
| Movie ID | Title       | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1        | Horror Story | 2010     |
| 2        | Fantasy Film | 1995     |
| 3        | Sci-Fi Adventure| 2008     |

Genre_Overview:
| Genre ID | Genre Name   | Release Year Min | Release Year Max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1       | Horror      | 1980          | 2020           |
| 2       | Fantasy     | 1995          | 2015           |
| 3       | Sci-Fi      | 1960          | 1980           |

Running the query above would return:

Movie ID | Title       | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2        | Fantasy Film | 1995     |

This is because the movie "Fantasy Film" was released in 1995, which falls within the range specified for the "Fantasy" genre (1995-2015).<end>

What SQL query would I use to retrieve all products along with their corresponding supplier name and category if they exist in both tables, but return NULL for the supplier name and category if a product does not have a matching entry in the suppliers table? The products table has the following columns:

| Product Name | SKU | Price | Stock Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

And the suppliers table has the following columns:

| Supplier ID | Supplier Name | Category |
| --- | --- | --- |

Note that the suppliers table does not have an SKU column, and it seems to be linked to products by supplier name and category. The products table also appears to be missing a primary key or any other unique identifier for each product.<start>To achieve this, you can use a `LEFT JOIN` between the `products` table and both the `suppliers` table on one hand, which requires linking through a non-existing SKU directly, and by considering categories, but more accurately through using `supplier_name`. Since the direct link to `Supplier ID` is missing due to the absence of an SKU or any unique identifier in the `products` table, we'll have to join based on the closest available match (`supplier_name`) and then filter for matching categories.

However, given the structure you've described, there seems to be a logical inconsistency. If we're linking products with suppliers via supplier name without an ID (or SKU), it implies a many-to-one relationship where each supplier could have multiple products, but not directly vice versa as you might expect from typical database design for suppliers and products.

Assuming the need is to retrieve all products along with their corresponding supplier name and category if they exist in both tables (i.e., using `supplier_name` for matching), here's a SQL query that uses `LEFT JOIN` to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    P.Product_Name, 
    S.Supplier_Name, 
    S.Category, 
    P.SKU,
    P.Price,
    P.Stock_Quantity
FROM products P
LEFT JOIN suppliers S ON P.Product_Name = S.Supplier_Name AND P.Stock_Quantity = S.Category;
```

This query assumes that for a match to be considered, the `Product Name` in `products` should equal the `Supplier Name` and there's an implied match based on the `Stock Quantity` matching with either being used as is due to missing data.

However, considering your description closely:

- The actual join condition seems flawed since you're suggesting a link between `supplier_name` and `category`, which doesn't align with typical database design for suppliers and products.
- There's no clear direct way to match a product to a supplier based on the information provided without a unique identifier.

A more logical approach would be to reconsider your table structure. Each row in both tables should ideally have a unique identifier or key (e.g., `Product ID` in `products` and `Supplier ID` in `suppliers`) for proper joins.

For demonstration purposes, let's correct the query assuming we're looking at categories for some supplier matching based on `supplier_name`, given your initial constraints:

```sql
SELECT 
    P.Product_Name, 
    (CASE WHEN S.Supplier_Name IS NOT NULL THEN S.Supplier_Name ELSE 'No Supplier' END) AS Supplier_Name,
    (CASE WHEN S.Category IS NOT NULL THEN S.Category ELSE 'No Category' END) AS Category,
    P.SKU,
    P.Price,
    P.Stock_Quantity
FROM products P
LEFT JOIN suppliers S ON P.Product_Name = S.Supplier_Name;
```

This query assumes a direct match in `Product Name` for supplier matching, which is still an oversimplification. For accurate joins and operations, revisiting your database schema to include a unique identifier or key would be advisable.

Please adjust the column names based on your actual table structure. This response corrects for common SQL join usage given constraints but encourages a more robust design approach if possible.<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve all restaurants with an Italian cuisine and their corresponding location(s), including restaurants that also serve other cuisines? Assume we have two tables: "Restaurants" with columns for Restaurant Name, Cuisine, Location, Rating, and Price Range, and "Restaurant_Cuisine" with a one-to-many relationship between restaurants and the cuisines they serve.<start>**SQL Query to Retrieve Italian Restaurants and Their Locations**

To retrieve all restaurants that serve Italian cuisine along with their corresponding locations, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT r.RestaurantName, c.Location 
FROM (
  SELECT RestaurantName, Location 
  FROM Restaurants 
  WHERE Cuisine = 'Italian'
) AS r 
JOIN Restaurant_Cuisine AS rc ON r.RestaurantName = rc.RestaurantName 
JOIN Locations AS l ON rc.CuisineID = l.CuisineID AND l.Cuisine = 'Italian';
```

However, assuming the "Restaurant_Cuisine" table has a one-to-many relationship between restaurants and the cuisines they serve, we can simplify this query to get all Italian cuisine restaurants with their locations using a `LEFT JOIN` on both tables:

```sql
SELECT r.RestaurantName, l.Location 
FROM Restaurants r 
JOIN Restaurant_Cuisine rc ON r.RestaurantName = rc.RestaurantName AND r.Cuisine = 'Italian'
LEFT JOIN Locations l ON rc.CuisineID = l.CuisineID;
```

This query selects all Italian restaurants from the "Restaurants" table and joins it with the "Restaurant_Cuisine" table where the restaurant name matches. It then performs a `LEFT JOIN` on the "Locations" table based on the cuisine ID.

**How this works:**

*   The first part of the query (`r.Cuisine = 'Italian'`) filters out only the restaurants that serve Italian cuisine from the "Restaurants" table.
*   Then, it matches these Italian restaurants with their corresponding cuisine IDs in the "Restaurant_Cuisine" table using a `JOIN`.
*   Finally, it performs a `LEFT JOIN` on the "Locations" table based on the cuisine ID to retrieve all locations associated with each restaurant.

By using this query, you can easily get a list of Italian restaurants along with their respective locations.<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve a list of restaurants with their corresponding cuisine, location, and price range where the restaurant name appears at least twice in the database? 

Assuming we have two tables:

**Restaurants**
| Restaurant Name | Cuisine | Location | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Golden Spoon | Mediterranean | Rochester, Minnesota | $ |
| Pasta Palace | Italian | Union City, California | $$$$ |
| Pizza Planet | Indian | Anderson, Indiana | $$ |
| Burger Haven | Italian | Twin Falls, Idaho | $$$ |
| Taco Town | Indian | Union City, California | $$$$$ |
| Burger Haven | Italian | Jersey City, New Jersey | $$ |
| Pizza Planet | Japanese | Bountiful, Utah | $$$ |
| BBQ Barn | Indian | Bryan, Texas | $ |

**Restaurant_Duplicates**
| Restaurant Name | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Burger Haven | 2 |
| Pizza Planet | 2 |

Note that the Restaurant_Duplicates table contains a list of restaurants with their corresponding count (the number of times they appear in the Restaurants table). The query should return all columns from the Restaurants table where the restaurant name appears at least twice.<start>Here is the SQL query that would retrieve the desired information:
```sql
SELECT r.*
FROM Restaurants r
JOIN Restaurant_Duplicates d ON r.Restaurant Name = d.Restaurant Name
WHERE d.Count >= 2;
```
This query joins the `Restaurants` table with the `Restaurant_Duplicates` table on the `Restaurant Name` column, and then filters the results to only include rows where the count in `Restaurant_Duplicates` is greater than or equal to 2. The `SELECT *` statement returns all columns from the joined `Restaurants` table.

Note that this assumes that the database management system being used supports joins (which most modern systems do). If your system does not support joins, you can use a subquery instead:
```sql
SELECT r.*
FROM Restaurants r
WHERE Restaurant Name IN (
  SELECT Restaurant Name
  FROM Restaurant_Duplicates
  WHERE Count >= 2
);
```
This query uses the `IN` operator to filter the results of the `Restaurants` table based on whether the restaurant name appears in the list returned by the subquery.<end>

What SQL query would return all locations and their corresponding temperatures from two weather tables: `weather_data` containing daily temperature records for cities across the United States and `historic_highs`, which includes highest-ever recorded temperatures for these cities? The result should include locations where there's a match in either table, as well as locations that are only found in one of the tables. Assume `weather_data` contains a column named `city` to identify each location, while `historic_highs` has a column named `location_name`. 

Here is an example of what the tables might look like:

**weather_data**
| city | Temperature (C) | Day |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Joplin, Missouri | 23.6 | Wednesday |
| Garland, Texas | 13.2 | Friday |
| Fountain Valley, California | 20.2 | Sunday |

**historic_highs**
| location_name | Highest Recorded Temperature (C) |
| --- | --- |
| Joplin, Missouri | 38.5 |
| Spokane, Washington | 43.8 |
| Dallas, Texas | 42.3 |
| Los Angeles, California | 34.6 |<start>To solve this problem, you can use the `UNION` operator in SQL to combine records from both tables where there's a match in either table. The key is using `LEFT JOIN` for each table and then selecting the relevant columns. Here's how you could write it:

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(wd.city, hh.location_name) AS location,
    wd.Temperature (C) AS temperature,
    COALESCE(hh.Highest Recorded Temperature (C), 0) AS historic_high
FROM weather_data wd
LEFT JOIN historic_highs hh ON lower(wd.city) = lower(hh.location_name)
UNION
SELECT 
    COALESCE(wd.city, hh.location_name) AS location,
    0 AS temperature,
    COALESCE(hh.Highest Recorded Temperature (C), 0) AS historic_high
FROM historic_highs hh
LEFT JOIN weather_data wd ON lower(hh.location_name) = lower(wd.city);
```

In this query:

1. The first part of the `UNION` combines records from both tables where there's a match.
2. In each SELECT, we use `COALESCE` to choose between values in `weather_data` and `historic_highs`. This way, if one table doesn't have an entry for a location that exists only in the other table, it won't be included.
3. The second part of the `UNION` is used to include records from either table, as long as they are not duplicates.

Note: Since we're comparing locations with different types (city vs location_name), and possibly different casing, we use the `LOWER` function to ensure a case-insensitive match.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with a self JOIN:

What is the average difference in battery level (%) between devices of each type (e.g., Pressure Sensor, Temperature Sensor, etc.) across all readings?

The relevant details are as follows:
- The table name is: "Device_Readings"
- The columns used for this query will be:
  - Device ID
  - Device Type
  - Battery Level (%)
- We can use the following example data (already provided) to solve the problem.

Note that we need to ensure we're comparing devices of the same type, so a self JOIN is required.<start>Here's how you'd write this SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  dr1.Device_Type,
  AVG(dr2.Battery_Level - dr1.Battery_Level) AS Average_Difference
FROM 
  Device_Readings dr1
JOIN 
  Device_Readings dr2 ON dr1.Device_Type = dr2.Device_Type AND dr1.Device_ID != dr2.Device_ID
GROUP BY 
  dr1.Device_Type;
```

This SQL query performs a self JOIN on the "Device_Readings" table. It selects all rows where the device type is the same but the device ID is different, effectively comparing each pair of readings across all devices for a given type. The `AVG` function then calculates the average difference in battery level between these pairs of readings.

For example, if we have two "Pressure Sensor" readings with Battery Levels 80% and 90%, this query will return an "Average Difference" of (90-80)/2 = 5 for Pressure Sensors.<end>

What SQL query can I use to retrieve all products from the "Products" table that have a name containing the word "Device", but exclude any products with names containing the phrase "Device" followed by a space and then any other characters? 

The Products table is defined as follows:

| Product Name | SKU | Price | Category | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contraption | SKU-1063 | 168.91 | Toys | Wayne Enterprises |
| Gadget | SKU-1092 | 403.94 | Household | Wonka Industries |
| Device | SKU-1004 | 216.56 | Automotive | Globex |
| Device | SKU-1048 | 56.45 | Sports | Wayne Enterprises |
| Doohickey | SKU-1093 | 441.86 | Sports | Globex |
| Instrument | SKU-1010 | 121.78 | Automotive | Umbrella Corp |

Can I use a simple SELECT statement with a LIKE operator in the WHERE clause to achieve this?<start>You can use a combination of LIKE and NOT operators in the WHERE clause to exclude products containing the phrase "Device" followed by a space and any other characters.

However, a simpler approach would be to use a regular expression (regex) in many SQL databases. Unfortunately, not all databases support regex out-of-the-box (e.g., MySQL doesn't).

For those that do support regex, you can use the `REGEXP` or `LIKE` operator with care:

**MySQL and MariaDB:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE Product_Name REGEXP 'Device[^[:space:]]*'
```
Note: The above query uses a negated character class `[^[:space:]]*`, which matches any non-space characters (including none).

However, since you asked for a simple SELECT statement with LIKE, let's use it instead:

**SQLite and PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE Product_Name NOT LIKE '% Device%' AND Product_Name LIKE '%Device%'
```
Note: The `%` wildcard is used to match any characters before and after the "Device" substring.

This query should return the desired results for your sample data.<end>

What is a SQL query that returns all restaurants from the "Restaurants" table (using columns: "Restaurant Name", "Cuisine") where there is no price range listed for them? The Restaurants table contains duplicate entries for some restaurant names and locations, but each entry has its own distinct cuisine.<start>**SQL Query: Get Restaurants with No Price Range**

To find all restaurants without a price range listing, you can use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
    Restaurant_Name,
    Cuisine
FROM 
    Restaurants
WHERE 
    Price_Range IS NULL;
```
However, since `Price_Range` might be empty (`''`) rather than `NULL`, we can use another approach to check for an absence of price range value:

**Alternative Query**
```sql
SELECT 
    Restaurant_Name,
    Cuisine
FROM 
    Restaurants
WHERE 
    Price_Range = '';
```
If the `Price_Range` column is actually a numeric type or contains other non-string values, you might need to adjust this query.

**Tips**

* If there are duplicate entries for some restaurant names and locations, but each entry has its own distinct cuisine, the above queries should work as expected.
* Make sure your database system supports `IS NULL` or string comparison operators (`=''`) in the WHERE clause. Most modern SQL databases do, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
* If you want to include restaurants with a price range value but no price specified (e.g., `$0 - $20`, etc.), replace the query above with this one:
```sql
SELECT 
    Restaurant_Name,
    Cuisine
FROM 
    Restaurants
WHERE 
    Price_Range NOT IN ('$', '$0', 'Priceless');
```
This will exclude restaurants with a clear price range indication. Be sure to adjust the `IN` clause values according to your actual data.

What SQL query would return the publication years of all movies that have been released in the past decade (2010-2019) where the genre is either Fantasy or Romance? The table "Movies" contains the following columns and data:

| Genre | Publication Year |
| --- | --- |
| Fantasy | 2015 |
| Romance | 1997 |
| Non-Fiction | 1973 |
| Romance | 2019 |

The query should not include movies where the publication year is missing.<start>Here is the SQL query that would return the desired results:
```sql
SELECT Publication_Year
FROM Movies
WHERE Genre IN ('Fantasy', 'Romance') AND 
      YEAR >= 2010 AND YEAR <= 2019;
```
However, this will not work because we cannot directly compare an aggregate function like `YEAR` with a literal value in the WHERE clause.

A better approach is to use the following query:
```sql
SELECT Publication_Year
FROM Movies
WHERE Genre IN ('Fantasy', 'Romance') AND 
      Publication_Year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019;
```
This will filter out any movies where `Publication_Year` is missing (NULL), because NULL values cannot be compared to numbers.

However, the best practice would be to avoid using the `BETWEEN` operator and instead use this query:
```sql
SELECT Publication_Year
FROM Movies
WHERE Genre IN ('Fantasy', 'Romance') AND 
      Publication_Year IS NOT NULL AND 
      Publication_Year >= 2010 AND Publication_Year <= 2019;
```
This approach is more explicit about what you're trying to accomplish and will avoid any potential issues with the `BETWEEN` operator.<end>

What is the average rating for books published before 2000 that have a minimum of two genres assigned to them? The Books table contains columns for Title, Author, Genre, and Publication Year, but not an explicit Rating column; however, the Genres table has a foreign key referencing the Titles in Books, allowing us to infer genre assignments per title through this relationship. We need to find the average rating of books that fit this specific criterion.<start>**SQL Solution**
```sql
WITH 
  -- Join the Books and Genres tables on the Title column
  BookGenres AS (
    SELECT B.Title, B.Publication_Year, G.Genre
    FROM Books B
    JOIN Genres G ON B.Title = G.Title
  )

-- Filter for books published before 2000 with at least two genres
SELECT AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM (
  SELECT BG.Title, AVG(RATING) AS Rating
  FROM BookGenres BG
  GROUP BY BG.Title
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Genre) >= 2 AND Publication_Year < 2000
) Subquery;
```
**Explanation**

This SQL solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `BookGenres` to join the `Books` and `Genres` tables based on the `Title` column. This CTE will contain all the books with their respective genres.

Next, we filter this result set in the outer query using another level of nesting (`SELECT AVG(Rating)...`). We first group the results by `Title`, then apply an aggregate function (in this case, `AVG`) to get the average rating per book. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only books with at least two genres are included.

Finally, we wrap all this in a subquery and use another level of nesting (`SELECT AVG(Rating)...`) to calculate the overall average rating across these filtered results.

**Assumptions**

* You have access to a database system that supports SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
* The `Books` table contains columns named `Title`, `Author`, `Genre`, and `Publication_Year`.
* The `Genres` table contains columns named `Title` and `Genre`, with the latter serving as the foreign key referencing the titles in the `Books` table.
* There exists an implicit or explicit column named `Rating` that we can use for calculation. If not, you might need to adjust this solution according to your actual data schema.

**Note**

The assumption about the existence of a `Rating` column might be incorrect, as stated in the problem description. In such cases, you'd need to modify the SQL query to correctly infer ratings based on additional data or business logic that isn't detailed here.<end>

Here's a SQL problem that requires SELECT with an OVER window function:

What SQL query would you use to calculate the rank of each city in the United States by population density, where the population density is calculated as the total number of people living in the city divided by its land area? The data on cities and their populations are stored in two tables: "Cities" with columns "City", "State", "Population", and "LandArea", and a table called "USStates" that contains the state's population density. However, you can only use the data from the "Cities" table for this query.

Example data:
| City | State | Population | LandArea |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New York City | New York | 8405837 | 302.6 |
| Los Angeles | California | 3990456 | 468.0 |
| Chicago | Illinois | 2695594 | 234.1 |
| Houston | Texas | 2323289 | 599.5 |
| Phoenix | Arizona | 1731392 | 516.7 |

What is the SQL query that would rank each city by its population density, assuming you have a column "Density" in the "USStates" table with the state's population density?<start>You can use a subquery to get the data from the "USStates" table and join it with the "Cities" table. However, since we're only using the data from the "Cities" table for this query, you don't actually need the "USStates" table at all.

Here's a SQL query that calculates the population density of each city in the United States by dividing its population by its land area and then ranks each city by its population density:

```sql
SELECT 
    City,
    Population / LandArea AS Density,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Population / LandArea DESC) AS Rank
FROM 
    Cities;
```

This query will assign a rank to each city based on its density, with the highest density cities getting a rank of 1 and so on. If two or more cities have the same density, they'll get the same rank.

Please note that if you're using SQL Server, you might need to use `RANK()` instead of `DENSE_RANK()`, depending on your database management system's version.<end>

What SQL query would you use to select the company names and calculate a new column 'PriceIncrease' that represents the difference between each row's Close Price and the Close Price of the previous day for FinanceTrust companies only? The table containing the stock prices is named 'stock_prices'. 

Example data:

| Company | Date       | Close Price | Low Price | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FinanceTrust | 2022-01-01 | 13.73 | 13.73 | 7760362 |
| HealthGen   | 2022-01-01 | 306.42 | 306.42 | 5447496 |
| FinanceTrust | 2022-01-02 | 458.19 | 274.86 | 2025371 |
| FinanceTrust | 2022-01-03 | 421.45 | 410.44 | 1345343 |
| HealthGen   | 2022-01-03 | 321.98 | 318.91 | 6451278 |

(Note: the dates are in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format)<start>Here is the SQL query that would achieve this:
```sql
SELECT 
  Company, 
  Date AS CurrentDate, 
  Close Price, 
  Low Price,
  Volume,
  (Close Price - LAG(Close Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Company ORDER BY Date)) AS PriceIncrease
FROM 
  stock_prices
WHERE 
  Company = 'FinanceTrust'
ORDER BY 
  Date;
```
Let me explain what's going on:

1. We're using the `LAG` function to access the Close Price of the previous day for each FinanceTrust company.
2. The `PARTITION BY` clause groups the results by Company, so we get the correct previous value for each row within a company group.
3. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures that rows are ordered chronologically, which is necessary for the `LAG` function to work correctly.
4. We're selecting all columns (`*`) except the PriceIncrease column, which we calculate using the formula `(Close Price - LAG(Close Price) OVER ...)`.
5. Finally, we're filtering the results to only include FinanceTrust companies.

Note: This assumes that your database management system (DBMS) is PostgreSQL or another DBMS that supports the `LAG` function. If you're using a different DBMS, you may need to modify the query accordingly.<end>

What SQL query would return a list of movies (along with their directors) where the director has also directed another movie in the same table, and I want to see the title of that other movie for each row? The Movies table contains the following data:

| Title | Director |
| --- | --- |
| Starbound Odyssey | Drake Nightshade |
| Dreamwalker | Rylan Frostblade |
| Edge of Infinity | Drake Nightshade |
| Mystery of the Depths | Lira Silverleaf |

Note: This query should not return any rows where the director has only directed one movie.<start>To solve this problem, we need to join the Movies table with itself on the Director column and then group by the Director to count how many movies they have directed. We will only include rows where the count is greater than 1.

Here's a SQL query that should accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT m1.Title AS PrimaryMovieTitle,
       m2.Title AS OtherMovieTitle,
       m1.Director
FROM Movies m1
JOIN Movies m2 ON m1.Director = m2.Director AND m1.Title != m2.Title
WHERE m2.Director IN ( SELECT Director FROM Movies GROUP BY Director HAVING COUNT(Director) > 1 )
```

This query works as follows:

- The subquery in the `IN` clause selects all directors that have more than one movie.
- The main query then joins the Movies table with itself on the Director column. This will give us rows where we can see two different movies for each director, along with their titles.
- We filter out any rows where the titles of the two movies are the same by adding `AND m1.Title != m2.Title`.<end>

What SQL query would I use to retrieve all the rows from the 'stock_prices' table where the 'Open Price' is greater than $1000 and then order these results by the 'Close Price' in descending order (highest to lowest)? The 'stock_prices' table contains the following columns:

| Date | Open Price | Close Price | High Price | Low Price | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2011-08-09 | 383.24 | 74.52 | 1318.35 | 74.52 | 1871833 |
| 2013-07-14 | 1350.59 | 1453.32 | 1453.32 | 66.25 | 4430201 |
| 2013-06-23 | 1499.4 | 54.55 | 1499.4 | 54.55 | 6141620 |
| 2010-09-11 | 662.7 | 784.66 | 784.66 | 662.7 | 8989874 |
| 2014-12-07 | 1427.7 | 101.95 | 1427.7 | 101.95 | 5124978 |
| 2018-07-19 | 906.82 | 798.78 | 1196.52 | 442.56 | 8908247 |<start>Here is the SQL query that retrieves all rows from the 'stock_prices' table where the 'Open Price' is greater than $1000 and then orders these results by the 'Close Price' in descending order (highest to lowest):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM stock_prices
WHERE Open Price > 1000
ORDER BY Close Price DESC;
```

This query will return all rows from the 'stock_prices' table where the 'Open Price' is greater than $1000, and then sort these results by the 'Close Price' in descending order (highest to lowest).

Note: The column name "Open Price" is quoted because it contains a space. In SQL, column names with spaces should be enclosed in quotes when referenced in a query.

Also note that this query will return all columns (`*`) from the table where the condition is met. If you only need specific columns, replace `*` with the actual column names, separated by commas:

```sql
SELECT Date, Close Price, High Price, Low Price, Volume
FROM stock_prices
WHERE Open Price > 1000
ORDER BY Close Price DESC;
```

This will return the specified columns (`Date`, `Close Price`, `High Price`, `Low Price`, and `Volume`) from the rows that meet the condition.<end>

What is the average temperature (rounded to one decimal place) by day of the week for locations where the condition was either "Windy", "Stormy" or "Foggy"? The data is stored in a table called "WeatherObservations" with columns: Location, Condition, Temperature (C), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (km/h), and Day.<start>To solve this problem, you will need to use SQL, which is a language for managing relational databases.

The steps are as follows:

1. **Identify relevant data**: Select locations where the condition was either "Windy", "Stormy" or "Foggy".

2. **Calculate average temperature by day of week**: For each day of the week (Monday to Sunday), find the average temperature across all locations that were experiencing one of these conditions.

Here's how you can write this query in SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    DAY,
    AVG(Temperature) AS Average_Temperature
FROM 
    WeatherObservations
WHERE 
    Condition IN ('Windy', 'Stormy', 'Foggy')
GROUP BY 
    DAY
ORDER BY 
    DAY;
```

This will return a list of each day of the week and its average temperature across all locations that were experiencing wind, storm or fog. The `IN` operator is used to match any of the specified conditions.

If you want to round the result to one decimal place as requested:

```sql
SELECT 
    DAY,
    ROUND(AVG(Temperature), 1) AS Average_Temperature
FROM 
    WeatherObservations
WHERE 
    Condition IN ('Windy', 'Stormy', 'Foggy')
GROUP BY 
    DAY
ORDER BY 
    DAY;
```

In this version, the `ROUND` function is used to round each average temperature to one decimal place.<end>

What SQL commands would you use to drop the "FuelUsage" table and then delete all rows from the "Trips" table that have a Duration (hours) greater than 20 hours?<start>To accomplish this, you would use two SQL commands. The first command is to drop the existing "FuelUsage" table if it exists. This is useful for cleaning up or reorganizing your database structure without having to worry about constraints.

The second command deletes rows from the "Trips" table based on a condition (Duration > 20 hours).

Here are the SQL commands you would use:

```sql
-- Drop the FuelUsage table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS FuelUsage;

-- Delete all rows from the Trips table where Duration is greater than 20 hours
DELETE FROM Trips
WHERE Duration > 20;
```

Note: The `IF EXISTS` clause in the first command is used to prevent an error when trying to drop a table that does not exist. This way, if you run the script multiple times, it won't throw an error each time it tries to drop a non-existent table.

Remember, be cautious with the DELETE statement as it permanently removes data from your database without providing an opportunity for recovery or backup like INSERT or UPDATE commands do. Always make sure you have backups of your database and consider using a WHERE clause with SELECT instead if you're unsure about deleting rows.<end>

What is a SQL query that inserts a new row into the 'Sensor_Readings' table with the following data: 
Device ID = device-0080, Device Type = Light Sensor, Location = Living Room, Battery Level (%) = 85.4, Reading Value = 23.59, Timestamp = 2022-03-15 14:02:54?<start>Here is a SQL query that inserts the specified data into the 'Sensor_Readings' table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Sensor_Readings (Device_ID, Device_Type, Location, Battery_Level, Reading_Value, Timestamp)
VALUES ('device-0080', 'Light Sensor', 'Living Room', 85.4, 23.59, '2022-03-15 14:02:54');
```

Note that the order of the values must match the order of the columns specified in the INSERT statement.

Also, it's worth noting that this query assumes that all the data types for each column are correct (e.g., Device_ID is a string, Battery_Level and Reading_Value are numbers, Timestamp is a datetime). If the actual table structure has different data types or constraints on these columns, the insert may fail.<end>

What SQL query would delete all customers who have an income of more than $400,000 and reside in either California or New York? The relevant tables involved are 'customers' with columns 'Name', 'Age', 'Birth Month', 'State', and 'Income'.<start>Here is the SQL query that would accomplish this:

```sql
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE Income > 400000 AND State IN ('California', 'New York');
```

This query works as follows:

- `DELETE FROM customers` specifies which table (`customers`) should be modified.
- `WHERE` indicates that you want to apply the conditions specified in the following clause to determine which rows are to be deleted.
- `Income > 400000` filters out any row where the income is less than or equal to $400,000.
- `State IN ('California', 'New York')` ensures that only customers who reside in either California or New York are targeted.

**Note:** Before executing a DELETE query, you should back up your database. Also, be cautious when running delete queries as they can permanently remove data from the table. If you're testing this on a production environment, make sure to have a backup first and test it on a non-critical section of your database.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires an UPDATE statement:

What SQL query would you use to increase the Market Cap of all stocks in the 'Technology' sector by 15%?

The table containing this data is named 'Stock_Data' and has the following columns: Sector, Market Cap, Stock Price, Annual Revenue (B), and Quarter.

Would your solution involve a single UPDATE statement or multiple steps?<start>To increase the Market Cap of all stocks in the 'Technology' sector by 15%, I would use a single UPDATE statement. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
UPDATE Stock_Data
SET Market_Cap = Market_Cap * 1.15
WHERE Sector = 'Technology';
```

In this query, we're updating the `Market_Cap` column for rows where the value in the `Sector` column is `'Technology'`. The update operation multiplies each `Market_Cap` by 1.15 (which represents a 15% increase), effectively increasing it by that amount.

Note: This assumes that you want to permanently modify your data and don't need any backup or original values for later reference. If you might want those, be sure to keep them somewhere safe before running this update statement!<end>

What SQL query would you use to create a table called "publicly_traded_companies" with columns for company type (small cap, mid cap, mega cap), stock price, and annual revenue in billions, along with an additional column for the market capitalization category? 

The market capitalization categories should be defined as follows:
- Market Cap: 'Small Cap' when Stock Price < 1000, 
'Mid Cap' when (Stock Price >= 1000) & (Stock Price <= 5000), and
'Mega Cap' otherwise.

Example data would include company details such as Mega Cap, Small Cap, etc. 

| Market Cap | Stock Price | Annual Revenue (B) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mega Cap | 369.22 | 184.64 |
| Small Cap | 911.33 | 241.8 |
| Mega Cap | 889.78 | 241.8 |

The table should include all existing data and allow for future additions of new companies.<start>Here is the SQL query to create the "publicly_traded_companies" table with the specified columns and constraints:
```sql
CREATE TABLE publicly_traded_companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (company_type IN ('Small Cap', 'Mid Cap', 'Mega Cap')),
    stock_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (stock_price > 0),
    annual_revenue DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (annual_revenue >= 0),
    market_cap VARCHAR(20) AS (
        CASE
            WHEN stock_price < 1000 THEN 'Small Cap'
            WHEN (stock_price >= 1000 AND stock_price <= 5000) THEN 'Mid Cap'
            ELSE 'Mega Cap'
        END
    )
);
```
However, since you want to store the calculated market cap category as a separate column for future reference and filtering purposes, I'll modify the query:
```sql
CREATE TABLE publicly_traded_companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (company_type IN ('Small Cap', 'Mid Cap', 'Mega Cap')),
    stock_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (stock_price > 0),
    annual_revenue DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (annual_revenue >= 0),
    market_cap VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_market_cap()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.stock_price < 1000 THEN
        UPDATE publicly_traded_companies SET market_cap = 'Small Cap' WHERE id = NEW.id;
    ELSIF (NEW.stock_price >= 1000 AND NEW.stock_price <= 5000) THEN
        UPDATE publicly_traded_companies SET market_cap = 'Mid Cap' WHERE id = NEW.id;
    ELSE
        UPDATE publicly_traded_companies SET market_cap = 'Mega Cap' WHERE id = NEW.id;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_market_cap BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON publicly_traded_companies FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE get_market_cap();
```
The first part of the query creates a table with columns for company type, stock price, annual revenue, and market cap (initially set to NULL).

In the second part, I define an AFTER trigger function `get_market_cap()` that calculates the market cap category based on the stock price. This function is then used as a BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE trigger on the "publicly_traded_companies" table.

When you insert or update data into this table, the trigger will automatically calculate and update the market cap column accordingly.

Example usage:
```sql
INSERT INTO publicly_traded_companies (company_type, stock_price, annual_revenue) VALUES ('Mega Cap', 369.22, 184.64);

SELECT * FROM publicly_traded_companies;

-- Result:
-- id | company_type | stock_price | annual_revenue | market_cap
-- --- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ----------
--   1 | Mega Cap     |      369.22 |           184.64 | Mega Cap

INSERT INTO publicly_traded_companies (company_type, stock_price, annual_revenue) VALUES ('Small Cap', 911.33, 241.8);

SELECT * FROM publicly_traded_companies;

-- Result:
-- id | company_type | stock_price | annual_revenue | market_cap
-- --- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ----------
--   1 | Mega Cap     |      369.22 |           184.64 | Mega Cap
--   2 | Small Cap    |      911.33 |            241.8 | Small Cap
```<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires ALTER TABLE:

**Problem:** I need to add a new column called "Date" of type datetime to my table "StockPrices" which already contains the data shown above. However, I also want to rename the existing column "Annual Revenue (B)" to simply "Revenue". How can I do this using SQL?

(Note: The table and data are as follows)
```sql
CREATE TABLE StockPrices (
  Company VARCHAR(255),
  Market_Cap VARCHAR(100),
  Stock_Price DECIMAL(10,2),
  Annual_Revenue_B DECIMAL(20,2)
);

INSERT INTO StockPrices (Company, Market_Cap, Stock_Price, Annual_Revenue_B)
VALUES 
('Foodies', 'Mega Cap', 257.07, 471.44),
('EcoEnergy', 'Small Cap', 247.28, 475.61),
('HealthPlus', 'Mega Cap', 977.82, 272.98),
('RetailHub', 'Large Cap', 472.66, 177.68),
('TechCorp', 'Mid Cap', 920.15, 360.95),
('Foodies', 'Mega Cap', 825.99, 414.58),
('FinanceWorks', 'Small Cap', 790.23, 491.26),
('EcoEnergy', 'Large Cap', 257.07, 217.88),
('GlobalTrade', 'Mid Cap', 157.26, 342.76),
('Foodies', 'Small Cap', 825.99, 226.26);
```
The goal is to modify the table structure using ALTER TABLE to add a new column "Date" of type datetime and rename the existing column "Annual_Revenue_B" to simply "Revenue".<start>Here's how you can achieve this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE StockPrices 
ADD COLUMN Date DATETIME AFTER Company;

ALTER TABLE StockPrices 
RENAME COLUMN Annual_Revenue_B TO Revenue;
```

This will add a new column called `Date` of type datetime after the existing `Company` column, and then rename the existing column `Annual_Revenue_B` to simply `Revenue`.

**Note**: The order of operations is important here. We first add the new column, and then we can rename the existing one without worrying about any potential conflicts with our data insertion logic.

If you want to ensure that SQL will not allow you to insert rows until both columns are present (and avoid silently skipping some fields), use this version instead:

```sql
ALTER TABLE StockPrices 
ADD COLUMN Date DATETIME AFTER Company;

-- Wait a bit for your changes to propagate...

ALTER TABLE StockPrices 
RENAME COLUMN Annual_Revenue_B TO Revenue;
```

However, the first version is much simpler and still works fine in most databases.

As always, make sure you have backed up your database before running such commands.<end>

What is the average Open Price on dates that have a Volume greater than 6 million, and also have an associated High Price that is at least 1000 points higher than the corresponding Close Price? 

Table: stock_prices

| Date | Open Price | Close Price | High Price | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2011-06-08 | 305.43 | 536.84 | 1068.34 | 8380573 |
| 2013-11-09 | 1467.52 | 617.89 | 1467.52 | 6483387 |
| 2014-01-16 | 602.76 | 337.92 | 642.28 | 6727362 |
| 2017-04-27 | 1258.26 | 384.65 | 1258.26 | 6727362 |
| 2020-09-04 | 334.78 | 617.89 | 617.89 | 7652777 |
| 2016-11-27 | 504.26 | 317.04 | 536.84 | 3603171 |
| 2014-04-25 | 392.64 | 617.89 | 617.89 | 2325457 |

This problem requires the use of the SELECT statement with conditional statements and a calculation to find the average Open Price for dates meeting the specified conditions.<start>To solve this problem, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(Open_Price) AS Average_Open_Price
FROM 
    stock_prices
WHERE 
    Volume > 6000000 AND High_price - Close_Price >= 1000;
```

In this query:

- The `AVG()` function is used to calculate the average of a column. In this case, we want to find the average Open Price for the specified conditions.
- We use the `SELECT` statement with the `FROM` clause to specify that we are retrieving data from the `stock_prices` table.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies two conditions:
  - The volume must be greater than 6 million.
  - The difference between the High Price and the Close Price must be at least 1000 points. This ensures that the High Price is at least 1000 points higher than the corresponding Close Price.

By combining these conditions, we can find the average Open Price for dates where both conditions are met.

Note: If there are no records meeting these conditions, this query will return `NULL` or an empty result set.<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve the restaurant name and location from the Restaurants table, along with the total number of reviews (if any) for each restaurant based on the Reviews table? The Reviews table contains a column 'Restaurant Name' that may or may not match the 'Restaurant Name' in the Restaurants table due to slight variations. If there is no matching review for a restaurant, display NULL instead of zero reviews.

Restaurants Table:
| Restaurant Name | Location | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sushi World | Cleveland Heights, Ohio | 4 |
| The Golden Spoon | Diamond Bar, California | 4 |
| Taco Town | Merced, California | 4 |
| Pasta Palace | Clovis, New Mexico | 3 |
| Vegan Delight | Hallandale Beach, Florida | 5 |
| BBQ Barn | Attleboro, Massachusetts | 3 |
| The Golden Spoon | Haverhill, Massachusetts | 4 |

Reviews Table:
| Reviewer's Name | Restaurant Name | Rating | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| John Doe | Sushi World | 5 | Great sushi! |
| Jane Smith | The Golden Spoon | 3 | Average food. |
| Bob Johnson | Taco Town | 4 | Delicious tacos! |
| Alice Brown | Pasta Palace | 2 | Overpriced pasta. |
| Michael Davis | Vegan Delight | 5 | Amazing vegan options! |

Note: There is no review for BBQ Barn and Sushi World in the Reviews table, but there should be a display of NULL instead of zero reviews in the query result.<start>To solve this problem, you can use the SQL `LEFT JOIN` clause to join the Restaurants table with the Reviews table on the 'Restaurant Name' column. The `LEFT JOIN` will return all records from the left table (Restaurants) and the matching records from the right table (Reviews). If there is no match, the result will contain NULL values for the right table.

Here's how to do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.Restaurant Name AS Restaurant_Name,
    r.Location,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN re.Rating IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS Total_Reviews
FROM Restaurants r
LEFT JOIN Reviews re ON LOWER(r.Restaurant Name) = LOWER(re.Restaurant Name)
GROUP BY r.Restaurant Name, r.Location;
```

However, the above query will count the reviews regardless of their rating. If you want to only count the reviews where the 'Rating' is not NULL and consider it as a valid review for that restaurant (regardless of the exact match), then we need to slightly modify it.

```sql
SELECT 
    r.Restaurant Name AS Restaurant_Name,
    r.Location,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN re.Rating IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS Total_Reviews
FROM Restaurants r
LEFT JOIN Reviews re ON LOWER(r.Restaurant Name) = LOWER(re.Restaurant Name)
GROUP BY r.Restaurant Name, r.Location;
```

But if you want to match the 'Restaurant Name' exactly and consider a review for a restaurant only when it matches the name exactly (without considering slight variations), then we can use the `INNER JOIN` clause instead of `LEFT JOIN`. 

Here is how to do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.Restaurant Name AS Restaurant_Name,
    r.Location,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN re.Rating IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS Total_Reviews
FROM Restaurants r
INNER JOIN Reviews re ON LOWER(r.Restaurant Name) = LOWER(re.Restaurant Name)
GROUP BY r.Restaurant Name, r.Location;
```

In the query above, if there is no matching review for a restaurant in the Reviews table (not even slight variations), that restaurant will not be included in the result.

Also note that `COALESCE` function is used to display 0 instead of NULL.<end>

What is a SQL query that returns all Pressure Sensor readings from 2023 along with their corresponding location and timestamp, joined with information about each device type (e.g., description of the sensor) from the 'device_types' table if it exists in the database, otherwise use the 'devices' table?

The relevant tables are:

**Devices**

| Device Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pressure Sensor | Measures pressure levels |
| Humidity Sensor | Measures humidity levels |
| Temperature Sensor | Measures temperature levels |
| Motion Detector | Detects motion |

**Readings**

| Device Type | Location | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pressure Sensor | Bathroom | 2023-01-01 04:10:59 |
| Humidity Sensor | Hallway | 2023-08-28 06:15:09 |
| Pressure Sensor | Kitchen | 2023-10-21 05:59:39 |
| Temperature Sensor | Living Room | 2023-12-21 08:33:14 |
| Pressure Sensor | Garage | 2023-03-23 02:43:29 |
| Motion Detector | Living Room | 2022-02-20 02:05:08 |
| Humidity Sensor | Garden | 2023-07-02 09:09:43 |
| Motion Detector | Hallway | 2021-08-28 05:09:17 |

The desired output is the list of Pressure Sensor readings from 2023 along with their location and timestamp, and if possible, a description of the sensor type.<start>To achieve this, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    R.Location,
    R.Timestamp AS ReadingTimestamp,
    DT.Description AS DeviceTypeDescription,
    R.Pressure
FROM 
    (SELECT * FROM Readings WHERE YEAR(Timestamp) = 2023 AND Device_Type = 'Pressure Sensor') R
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT DISTINCT Device_Type, Description FROM Devices UNION SELECT DISTINCT Device_Type, NULL FROM devices WHERE Device_Type NOT IN ('Humidity Sensor', 'Temperature Sensor', 'Motion Detector')) DT
ON 
    R.Device_Type = DT.Device_Type;
```

This query does the following:

1. It selects all rows from `Readings` where the year of the timestamp is 2023 and the device type is 'Pressure Sensor'.

2. If a 'device_types' table exists in the database, it left joins this with the result from step 1 on the condition that the Device_Type matches.

   - However, for the join to work without issues, we need to make sure all possible values from `Readings` are included in the union of 'Devices' and 'devices'. Hence we add a subquery using `UNION`, which will include the NULL description for any sensor types not present in the table. 

3. It selects the location from `Readings`, the timestamp as ReadingTimestamp (to distinguish it from the join operation), and the device type description if available.

4. The results are returned, but since we used LEFT JOIN, all pressure readings with their corresponding location and timestamp will be included even if there is no matching row in 'device_types'.<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve the Market Cap and Annual Revenue (B) of companies that have both a Stock Price higher than $600 and are listed as either Large or Mega Cap? 

The relevant tables for this problem include 'Stocks' with columns: Company, Stock Price, and Market Cap. Additionally, there is a table called 'FinancialData' which includes the Annual Revenue (B) of companies.

Example data from the 'Stocks' table:
| Company | Stock Price | Market Cap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GlobalTrade | 661.18 | Mid Cap |
| HealthPlus | 585.59 | Mid Cap |
| RetailHub | 104.11 | Large Cap |
| HealthPlus | 561.19 | Large Cap |
| HealthPlus | 739.73 | Mega Cap |
| AeroSpace | 528.49 | Large Cap |
| EcoEnergy | 493.49 | Mega Cap |
| Foodies | 727.81 | Large Cap |
| RetailHub | 107.54 | Small Cap |

Example data from the 'FinancialData' table:
| Company | Annual Revenue (B) |
| --- | --- |
| GlobalTrade | 496.96 |
| HealthPlus | 51.93 |
| RetailHub | 461.25 |
| HealthPlus | 463.53 |
| HealthPlus | 481.59 |
| AeroSpace | 167.91 |
| EcoEnergy | 431.96 |
| Foodies | 417.88 |
| RetailHub | 414.97 |

Note that the Market Cap is categorized as either Mid, Large, or Mega Cap.<start>To solve this problem, we'll need to combine data from two tables (`Stocks` and `FinancialData`) while taking into account the categorical nature of the `Market Cap`. We can do this using a CASE statement within the SQL query.

Here's the query:
```sql
SELECT 
    s.Company,
    s.Stock_Price AS Stock_Price,
    f.Annual_Revenue (B) AS Annual_Revenue_B,
    s.Market_Cap AS Market_Cap,
    s.Market_Cap AS Market_Cap_Category
FROM 
    Stocks s
JOIN 
    FinancialData f ON s.Company = f.Company
WHERE 
    s.Stock_Price > 600 AND 
    (s.Market_Cap IN ('Large Cap', 'Mega Cap'));
```
However, to correctly handle the categories in the query and make the selection based on these categories you should rewrite it using CASE statement as follows:
```sql
SELECT 
    s.Company,
    s.Stock_Price AS Stock_Price,
    f.Annual_Revenue (B) AS Annual_Revenue_B,
    s.Market_Cap AS Market_Cap
FROM 
    Stocks s
JOIN 
    FinancialData f ON s.Company = f.Company
WHERE 
    s.Stock_Price > 600 AND 
    CASE s.Market_Cap
        WHEN 'Large Cap' THEN TRUE
        WHEN 'Mega Cap' THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END;
```
This will correctly select the rows where the stock price is higher than $600 and the market cap is either Large or Mega.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with a FULL JOIN:

What is the most recent year in which there was at least one stock traded with an open price above $1000 and at least one stock traded with a close price below $500, grouped by company? Assume the data includes all trading activity since 2010. 

The relevant table for this problem is called 'stock_data'. The table has the following columns:

| Company | Date | Open Price | Close Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FoodChain | 2010-10-14 | 863.66 | 1067.29 |
| MediaGroup | 2023-04-09 | 26.38 | 1113.23 |
| AeroSystems | 2020-02-03 | 885.61 | 724.34 |
| TechnoCorp | 2017-08-12 | 1095.89 | 1394.85 |
| RetailWorld | 2011-11-05 | 1113.23 | 401.77 |
| HealthGen | 2015-09-02 | 1407.81 | 551.97 |
| AeroSystems | 2016-02-15 | 1045.04 | 648.9 |
| AutoMotive | 2021-06-16 | 773.66 | 835.28 |
| GreenEnergy | 2022-06-09 | 511.22 | 1388.92 |

The task requires finding the most recent year in which there was at least one stock traded with an open price above $1000 and at least one stock traded with a close price below $500, grouped by company.<start>Here's how you can solve this problem using SQL.

```sql
SELECT 
    company,
    MAX(YEAR(date)) AS most_recent_year
FROM (
    SELECT 
        company,
        date,
        -- Using ROW_NUMBER to flag stocks traded with open price above $1000 and close price below $500
        CASE 
            WHEN open_price > 1000 AND close_price < 500 THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS is_traded_condition_met
    FROM stock_data
) T
WHERE 
    -- Grouping rows where the condition is met at least once and keeping only most recent year
    SUM(is_traded_condition_met) > 0 AND MAX(YEAR(date)) = MIN(YEAR(date))
GROUP BY company;
```

This query first selects stocks from `stock_data` with an open price above $1000 and a close price below $500, flagging them as `1`. It then groups these results by company, selecting the most recent year where this condition was met at least once for each group. The `SUM(is_traded_condition_met)` function checks whether there were any stocks meeting the trading conditions in each group. If such a stock existed and it's the most recent, then that date is included in the result.

Note: This query assumes SQL dialect supports FULL JOIN (this example uses standard SQL which does not support FULL JOIN explicitly). The `FULL JOIN` could be avoided by using subqueries or aggregation functions like shown above, however if available, you may use it as an alternative approach:

```sql
SELECT 
    company,
    MAX(YEAR(date)) AS most_recent_year
FROM (
    SELECT 
        company,
        date,
        -- Using ROW_NUMBER to flag stocks traded with open price above $1000 and close price below $500
        CASE 
            WHEN open_price > 1000 AND close_price < 500 THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS is_traded_condition_met
    FROM stock_data
) T
GROUP BY company
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN is_traded_condition_met = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 2;
```<end>

What SQL query would return all rows where the battery level of a device is greater than the average battery level of the same type of device across different locations? The table to draw from is called 'Sensor_Readings' and includes columns for Device Type, Location, Battery Level (%), and Reading Value. Assume that we only need to consider devices of the same type in our comparison, so a self JOIN will be necessary.<start>To solve this problem, you can use a SQL query that first calculates the average battery level for each device type across all locations (and possibly across different types), and then selects rows from your original table where the battery level is higher than this calculated average for devices of the same type.

Here's how you could structure such a query:

```sql
WITH AverageBatteryLevels AS (
    SELECT 
        Device_Type,
        AVG(Battery_Level) AS Avg_Battery_Level
    FROM Sensor_Readings
    GROUP BY Device_Type
)
SELECT sr.*
FROM Sensor_Readings sr
JOIN AverageBatteryLevels abl ON sr.Device_Type = abl.Device_Type
WHERE sr.Battery_Level > abl.Avg_Battery_Level;
```

This query does the following:

1. It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `AverageBatteryLevels` to first find the average battery level for each device type across all locations.
2. Then, it joins this CTE with the original table (`Sensor_Readings`) on the condition that the `Device_Type` is the same in both tables.
3. Finally, it selects rows from the joined result where the `Battery_Level` of a device is greater than its corresponding average battery level for devices of the same type.

This query assumes that you want to consider all readings across different locations and types when calculating the average battery level for each type. If you need to calculate averages separately by location, you would need to adjust the first part of the query accordingly, likely using a `WITH` statement with multiple levels or subqueries within the main `SELECT`. However, the essence remains the same: comparing individual device readings against aggregated statistics (average battery level here) for similar devices.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem:

What is the publication year of all books in our catalog where the author's last name starts with a letter between "A" and "C", inclusive? We have the following table:

**Books**

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tales of the Brave | Luna Silverleaf | Thriller | 1962 | 4.2 |
| Tales of the Brave | Rowan Ashborne | Non-Fiction | 1972 | 4.3 |

We need to find all books where the author's last name starts with a letter between "A" and "C", inclusive, using SQL.<start>**Solution**

To solve this problem, we can use a simple `WHERE` clause in our SQL query. We'll filter the results based on the condition that the author's last name starts with a letter between "A" and "C", inclusive.

```sql
SELECT Publication Year
FROM Books
WHERE Author LIKE '[A-C]%';
```

In this query:

*   `LIKE` is used to match strings against a pattern.
*   The pattern `[A-C]` matches any string that starts with a letter between "A" and "C", inclusive. This works because square brackets (`[]`) in SQL are used to specify character classes, where each character inside the brackets can be matched individually.

**Result**

When you run this query on your **Books** table, it will return the publication year of all books where the author's last name starts with a letter between "A" and "C", inclusive.

| Publication Year |
| --- |
| 1962 |
| 1972 |
| 1952 |

These are the publication years for the following books:

*   **Tales of the Brave** by Rowan Ashborne
*   **Whispers of the Abyss** by Orion Frostblade<end>

Here is an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with a IS NULL in the WHERE clause:

What is the total average latency for all databases where there are no timestamps recorded after 2022?<start>**Solution**

We'll use a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause containing `IS NULL`. The goal is to find the average latency for databases without any timestamp records after 2022.

```sql
SELECT AVG(latency)
FROM database_performance
WHERE timestamp IS NULL AND name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM database_performance WHERE timestamp > '2022-01-01');
```

**Explanation**

* We're selecting the `AVG` of `latency` from the `database_performance` table.
* The `WHERE` clause filters for rows where:
	+ `timestamp IS NULL`: This ensures we only consider databases without any recent timestamp records (i.e., after 2022).
	+ `name NOT IN ...`: This subquery excludes databases that have a timestamp record after 2022, ensuring we're only averaging latencies from older records.

**Assumptions**

* The `database_performance` table contains columns named `latency`, `timestamp`, and `name`.
* The `timestamp` column is of a date/time type (e.g., `DATE`, `DATETIME`).

**Example Use Case**

Suppose we have the following data in the `database_performance` table:

| name      | latency | timestamp        |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| DB1       | 10.5    | 2022-01-01         |
| DB1       | 12.8    | 2021-06-01         |
| DB2       | 7.3     | NULL              |
| DB3       | 15.6    | 2022-02-01         |

Running the above query would return an average latency of `9.6` for databases without recent timestamp records (i.e., `DB1` and `DB2`).<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve the total fuel used and average duration of trips that started from a city with the same end location as another trip also starting from Los Angeles? The table name is "Trips" and it has the following columns: Start Location, End Location, Duration (hours), Fuel Used (gallons).<start>Here's a SQL query to solve this problem:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN T1.StartLocation = 'Los Angeles' THEN T2.FuelUsed ELSE 0 END) AS TotalFuel,
    AVG(DURATION * CASE WHEN T1.StartLocation = 'Los Angeles' AND T2.StartLocation = T1.EndLocation THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS AverageDuration
FROM 
    Trips T1
JOIN 
    Trips T2 ON (T1.StartLocation = 'Los Angeles') AND (T1.EndLocation = T2.StartLocation)
WHERE 
    (T1.StartLocation = 'Los Angeles' AND T2.StartLocation = T1.EndLocation);
```

However, this query will not produce the desired result. The reason for this is that the subquery in the CASE statement inside SUM() and AVG() functions doesn't make sense. 

The correct SQL query should be:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(T1.FuelUsed) AS TotalFuel,
    AVG(T2.Duration) AS AverageDuration
FROM 
    Trips T1
JOIN 
    Trips T2 ON (T1.StartLocation = 'Los Angeles' AND T1.EndLocation = T2.StartLocation)
WHERE 
    T2.StartLocation IN (SELECT EndLocation FROM Trips WHERE StartLocation = 'Los Angeles');
```

This query joins the `Trips` table with itself on two conditions:

- The start location of the first trip is Los Angeles and its end location equals the start location of another trip.
- The start location of the second trip is in the list of cities that have another trip starting from Los Angeles.

The SUM() function calculates the total fuel used for trips starting from Los Angeles with their end locations being the start location of other trips. The AVG() function computes the average duration of these trips.<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve all unique companies from a stock prices database (stock_prices) where the average volume of their stock trades on days when the open price is higher than $1000 is greater than 5 million? 

Table schema:

stock_prices
| Company | Date | Open Price | Low Price | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AutoMotive | 2021-05-05 | 53.26 | 53.26 | 3330758 |
| HealthGen | 2017-05-12 | 1211.08 | 201.08 | 5667177 |
| RetailWorld | 2019-03-01 | 683.9 | 683.9 | 7509294 |
| TechnoCorp | 2010-11-15 | 666.33 | 610.57 | 8144912 |

The desired output should be a list of company names, sorted alphabetically by company name.<start>Here is the SQL query that would accomplish this:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Company
FROM stock_prices
WHERE Volume > 5000000 AND Open Price > 1000
GROUP BY Company
HAVING AVG(CASE WHEN Open Price > 1000 THEN Volume ELSE NULL END) > 5000000
ORDER BY Company;
```
Let's break down what this query does:

1. `SELECT DISTINCT Company`: This selects only the unique company names from the table.
2. `FROM stock_prices`: This specifies the table to select from.
3. `WHERE Volume > 5000000 AND Open Price > 1000`: This filters the data to include only rows where the volume is greater than 5 million and the open price is higher than $1000.
4. `GROUP BY Company`: This groups the remaining rows by company name, so that we can calculate an average volume per company.
5. `HAVING AVG(CASE WHEN Open Price > 1000 THEN Volume ELSE NULL END) > 5000000`: This filters the grouped data to include only companies where the average volume on days when the open price is higher than $1000 is greater than 5 million.
6. `ORDER BY Company`: Finally, this sorts the result set by company name.

Note that I've used a subquery in the `HAVING` clause to calculate the average volume per company only for rows where the open price is higher than $1000. This is necessary because we only want to consider days when the open price meets the condition. The `CASE` statement inside the `AVG` function returns `NULL` for rows that don't meet this condition, so they are effectively ignored in the average calculation.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with a OVER window function:

What SQL query would you use to find the top-rated book in each genre of books, along with the author's name and the publication year?

The table "Books" contains the following columns:
| Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orion Frostblade | Non-Fiction | 2007 | 2.3 |
| Isla Windrider | Fantasy | 2008 | 4.4 |
| Luna Silverleaf | Romance | 1974 | 2.8 |
| Kara Firebrand | Non-Fiction | 1984 | 2.3 |
| Sylvia Nightshade | Historical | 1973 | 2.9 |
| Thorne Ironwood | Romance | 2007 | 2.2 |
| Draven Blackthorn | Romance | 1983 | 4.4 |
| Elara Moonshadow | Horror | 2004 | 3.6 |

Using the OVER window function, how would you write a SQL query to achieve this result?<start>Here's an example of a SQL query that uses the OVER window function to achieve the desired result:

```sql
SELECT 
    Author,
    Genre,
    Publication_Year,
    Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Author,
        Genre,
        Publication_Year,
        Rating,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Genre ORDER BY Rating DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Books
) AS subquery
WHERE Rank = 1;
```

However, this will return all the books from the top-rated genre, not just one per genre.

Here's a more comprehensive SQL query that will return the top-rated book in each genre, along with the author's name and the publication year:

```sql
SELECT 
    Author,
    Genre,
    Publication_Year,
    Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Author,
        Genre,
        Publication_Year,
        Rating,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Genre ORDER BY Rating DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Books
) AS subquery
WHERE Rank = 1;
```

This query uses a subquery to assign a rank to each book within its genre based on the rating, and then it selects only the rows where the rank is equal to one. This will return the top-rated book in each genre.

However, if you want to make sure that only one row per genre is returned (in case of ties), you might be better off using DENSE_RANK() or ROW_NUMBER():

```sql
SELECT 
    Author,
    Genre,
    Publication_Year,
    Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Author,
        Genre,
        Publication_Year,
        Rating,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Genre ORDER BY Rating DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Books
) AS subquery
WHERE Rank = 1;
```

Or

```sql
SELECT 
    Author,
    Genre,
    Publication_Year,
    Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Author,
        Genre,
        Publication_Year,
        Rating,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Genre ORDER BY Rating DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Books
) AS subquery
WHERE DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Genre ORDER BY Rating DESC) = 1;
```

Or

```sql
SELECT 
    Author,
    Genre,
    Publication_Year,
    Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Author,
        Genre,
        Publication_Year,
        Rating,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Genre ORDER BY Rating DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Books
) AS subquery
WHERE Rank = 1;
```

But the final answer will be more better with using DENSE_RANK():

```sql
SELECT 
    Author,
    Genre,
    Publication_Year,
    Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Author,
        Genre,
        Publication_Year,
        Rating,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Genre ORDER BY Rating DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Books
) AS subquery
WHERE Rank = 1;
```

Note: The actual SQL syntax may vary slightly depending on the specific database management system you are using.<end>

What is a SQL query that uses the LAG function to select all products from the 'products' table where the current stock quantity is less than the previous stock quantity by at least 20 units, and order the results by product name? The 'products' table has columns for Product Name, SKU, Price, Stock Quantity, and Category.<start>Here's a SQL query that uses the LAG function to solve your problem:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT p.*, 
           (p.StockQuantity - LAG(p.StockQuantity) OVER (ORDER BY p.ProductName)) AS stock_difference
    FROM products p
) subquery
WHERE stock_difference >= 20;
```

This query first selects all columns from the 'products' table and calculates a new column called `stock_difference` which is the difference between the current stock quantity and the previous one. The LAG function is used here to get the previous stock quantity.

Then, it selects only the rows where this difference is greater than or equal to 20.

Finally, the results are ordered by product name. 

Note: This query assumes that the database system being used supports the LAG function (e.g., SQL Server 2012 and later versions). If you're using an earlier version of SQL Server or a different database system, you might need to use a different approach to solve this problem.

Example:

Let's say your 'products' table has the following rows:

| Product Name | SKU | Price | Stock Quantity | Category |
|--------------|-----|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Product A    | 1   | 10.99 | 50             | Cat1     |
| Product B    | 2   | 5.99  | 80             | Cat2     |
| Product C    | 3   | 7.99  | 40             | Cat3     |
| Product D    | 4   | 9.99  | 60             | Cat1     |

The stock quantity of Product A decreases by more than 20 units compared to the previous row (which doesn't exist, but we can assume that). So it would be included in the result set.

However, there is no decrease for Product B and C since their stock quantities increase or remain the same.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return the Device ID and Reading Value for each reading in the Devices table, but also include a new column "Next_Value" which contains the next Reading Value in time order if it exists, and a value of NULL otherwise?<start>Here is the SQL query you requested:

```sql
SELECT 
    d.DeviceID,
    r.ReadingValue,
    COALESCE((SELECT r2.ReadingValue FROM Readings r2 WHERE r2.DeviceID = d.DeviceID AND r2.ReadingTime > r.ReadingTime ORDER BY r2.ReadingTime LIMIT 1), NULL) AS Next_Value
FROM Devices d
JOIN Readings r ON d.DeviceID = r.DeviceID
ORDER BY d.DeviceID, r.ReadingTime;
```

In this query:

*   We select the columns we want from the `Devices` and `Readings` tables by joining them on `DeviceID`.
*   The subquery within the COALESCE function finds the next reading value for each device ID.
*   If a next reading exists (i.e., it returns a row), the COALESCE function returns this value. Otherwise, it returns NULL.

This query should return all readings with their respective next values if they exist.

However, using a subquery in the SELECT clause can be inefficient for large tables as SQL Server will execute the subquery once for each reading. A better way would be to use a JOIN or a window function (such as LAG), which are generally faster:

```sql
SELECT 
    d.DeviceID,
    r.ReadingValue,
    COALESCE(r2.ReadingValue, NULL) AS Next_Value
FROM Devices d
JOIN Readings r ON d.DeviceID = r.DeviceID
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DeviceID, ReadingValue, ReadingTime, LAG(ReadingValue) OVER (PARTITION BY DeviceID ORDER BY ReadingTime) AS Prev_Reading 
    FROM Readings
) r2 ON r.DeviceID = r2.DeviceID AND r.ReadingTime < r2.ReadingTime
ORDER BY d.DeviceID, r.ReadingTime;
```

In this revised query:

*   We use a LEFT JOIN to join the `Readings` table with its own subquery that uses LAG to find the next reading value.
*   The COALESCE function returns NULL if there is no previous reading (which means we are looking for the "next" reading, and it does not exist).
*   This query will also be faster as SQL Server can use indexes on `Readings(DeviceID, ReadingTime)` to improve performance.<end>

What is a SQL query that can be used to retrieve the names of customers from the `customers` table who have an income greater than $200,000 in descending order by age? The `customers` table contains the following columns:

| Name | Age | Income |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tricia | 41 | 420000 |
| Pat | 56 | 425000 |
| Raymond | 25 | 125000 |
| Jeremy | 58 | 395000 |
| Jayce | 32 | 195000 |
| Arthur | 53 | 175000 |
| Earl | 48 | 475000 |
| Melinda | 65 | 400000 |

And what if there are multiple customers with the same income, how can I sort them by age in descending order and then by income in descending order?<start>**SQL Query to Retrieve Customer Names**
======================================

To retrieve the names of customers from the `customers` table who have an income greater than $200,000 in descending order by age, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT Name
FROM customers
WHERE Income > 200000
ORDER BY Age DESC;
```

This query selects the `Name` column from the `customers` table where the `Income` is greater than $200,000. The results are then sorted in descending order by age using the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Sorting by Multiple Columns**
------------------------------

If there are multiple customers with the same income, you can sort them by age in descending order and then by income in descending order using the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT Name
FROM customers
WHERE Income > 200000
ORDER BY Age DESC, Income DESC;
```

This query sorts the results first by `Age` in descending order (i.e., oldest to youngest), and then by `Income` in descending order (i.e., highest income to lowest). This ensures that customers with the same income are sorted by age and then by income.

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

Suppose we want to retrieve the names of customers who have an income greater than $200,000. The query would return:

| Name |
| --- |
| Pat |
| Earl |

Since both Pat and Earl have incomes over $200,000, they are both selected. However, if there were multiple customers with incomes over $200,000, the query would sort them first by age in descending order (i.e., oldest to youngest), and then by income in descending order (i.e., highest income to lowest).<end>

What is a SQL query that would give me the total number of movies released in each year by the directors "Cade Firebrand" and "Zara Stormrider", considering only years where they have at least one movie released? 

Table: Movies
| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rise of the Titans | Mara Moonshadow | Drama | 1999 |
| Dreamwalker | Cade Firebrand | Horror | 1980 |
| The Endless Horizon | Cade Firebrand | Sci-Fi | 1981 |
| Beyond the Veil | Zara Stormrider | Comedy | 1981 |
| Timeless Journey | Cade Firebrand | Action | 1982 |
| Winds of Change | Zara Stormrider | Adventure | 1985 |
| A New Dawn | Mara Moonshadow | Fantasy | 1998 |
| Shadows of the Past | Cade Firebrand | Drama | 1979 |<start>Here is a SQL query that will give you the total number of movies released in each year by the directors "Cade Firebrand" and "Zara Stormrider", considering only years where they have at least one movie released:

```sql
SELECT 
    ReleaseYear,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Director = 'Cade Firebrand' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Cade_Firebrand_Total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Director = 'Zara Stormrider' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Zara_Stormrider_Total
FROM 
    Movies
WHERE 
    Director IN ('Cade Firebrand', 'Zara Stormrider')
GROUP BY 
    ReleaseYear
HAVING 
    Cade_Firebrand_Total > 0 OR Zara_Stormrider_Total > 0;
```

This query works as follows:

1. It selects the `ReleaseYear` column from the `Movies` table.
2. It uses a `CASE` statement to count the number of movies released by each director in the current year.
3. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where the director is either "Cade Firebrand" or "Zara Stormrider".
4. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the `ReleaseYear`.
5. The `HAVING` clause filters the grouped results to only include years where at least one of the directors has released a movie.

The result will be a table with two columns: `ReleaseYear` and two additional columns, one for each director, containing the total number of movies released by that director in each year. If a director has no movies released in a particular year, the corresponding column will contain `NULL`.<end>

What SQL query would I need to execute in order to delete a table called "reviews" that has columns for "review_id", "restaurant_name", "date_reviewed", and "content", after first removing all related entries from another table called "comments" which is linked to the reviews table through a foreign key on the "review_id" column, assuming the "reviews" table was previously dropped incorrectly and I now want to recreate it with an updated data type for the "date_reviewed" column?<start>To achieve this, you would need to execute two SQL queries in sequence:

1. **Delete related entries from `comments` table**:

```sql
DELETE c
FROM comments c
JOIN reviews r ON c.review_id = r.review_id;
```

This query deletes all rows from the `comments` table that have a matching `review_id` in the `reviews` table.

2. **Drop the existing `reviews` table and recreate it with updated data type**:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reviews;

CREATE TABLE reviews (
  review_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  restaurant_name VARCHAR(255),
  date_reviewed DATE,  -- Update the data type to DATE
  content TEXT
);
```

However, if you want to preserve the existing structure of the `reviews` table and only update the data type of one column (in this case, `date_reviewed`), you would need to modify step 2 as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE reviews
MODIFY COLUMN date_reviewed DATE;
```

This command modifies the existing `date_reviewed` column to use the `DATE` data type.

The complete process of deleting related entries from one table, dropping the target table, and recreating it with an updated structure is as shown above.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem:

**Question:** I have a weather monitoring system that collects data from various locations across the United States on a daily basis. The data includes temperature in Celsius, humidity as a percentage, wind speed in kilometers per hour, and the day of collection.

I want to insert new records into the `weather_data` table for the following locations and dates: "New Orleans, Louisiana" with a temperature of 25.4°C, humidity of 59%, and wind speed of 16.5 km/h on Thursday; and "Santa Barbara, California" with a temperature of 13.9°C, humidity of 62%, and wind speed of 12.2 km/h on Monday.

What is the correct SQL command to insert these new records into the `weather_data` table?

**Table Structure:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE weather_data (
    Location VARCHAR(50),
    Temperature DECIMAL(5, 1),
    Humidity INT,
    Wind_Speed DECIMAL(4, 1),
    Day DATE
);
```

**Current Data (if needed):**

| Location | Temperature (C) | Humidity (%) | Wind Speed (km/h) | Day |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rochester, New York | 37.6 | 56 | 11.4 | Wednesday |
| Lancaster, Pennsylvania | -2.9 | 83 | 23.7 | Wednesday |
| Springfield, Oregon | -7.3 | 97 | 10.6 | Wednesday |
| Visalia, California | 18.8 | 41 | 12.1 | Tuesday |
| Meridian, Mississippi | 5.9 | 25 | 8.1 | Tuesday |
| San Gabriel, California | -7.3 | 85 | 20.3 | Friday |
| Moreno Valley, California | 17.8 | 43 | 23.5 | Sunday |<start>**Correct SQL Command:**

```sql
INSERT INTO weather_data (Location, Temperature, Humidity, Wind_Speed, Day)
VALUES 
('New Orleans, Louisiana', 25.4, 59, 16.5, 'Thursday'),
('Santa Barbara, California', 13.9, 62, 12.2, 'Monday');
```

This SQL command inserts two new records into the `weather_data` table with the specified location, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and day of collection.

**Note:** The values for temperature are in decimal format as per the data type specified in the table structure (`DECIMAL(5, 1)`).<end>

What is the most efficient way to delete all rows from the `Books` table where the `Publication Year` is greater than or equal to 2020 and the `Rating` is less than 3.5? The `Books` table has the following structure:

| Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The example data provided is not necessary for this query, but the problem assumes it exists in a database with a similar schema.<start>To delete all rows from the `Books` table where the `Publication Year` is greater than or equal to 2020 and the `Rating` is less than 3.5 efficiently, you can use a SQL query that directly targets these conditions without needing to sort or otherwise manipulate the data unnecessarily.

Here's how you might write this query:

```sql
DELETE FROM Books
WHERE Publication_Year >= 2020 AND Rating < 3.5;
```

This query is efficient because it uses the most direct and efficient method available in SQL for deleting rows based on conditions: directly applying those conditions to the WHERE clause of a DELETE statement.

- `Publication_Year >= 2020` checks if the publication year of each book is 2020 or later.
- `Rating < 3.5` checks if the rating of each book is less than 3.5.

The combination of these two conditions (`AND` between them) ensures that only rows where both conditions are true will be deleted. This approach does not require any sorting, grouping, or subqueries unless those are specifically necessary for other reasons (like optimizing the query by reducing the number of rows being processed), which is not indicated here.

Always keep in mind when writing SQL queries that efficiency can depend on your specific database system and data structure. However, for most standard use cases, this approach should be efficient.<end>

What SQL query would you use to update the "Reading Value" column in the "sensors_data" table where the "Device Type" is "Temperature Sensor", and set it to be the average of the current reading value and 10? The "sensors_data" table has the following columns: "Device ID", "Device Type", "Reading Value", and "Timestamp".<start>You can use the following SQL query:

```sql
UPDATE sensors_data
SET Reading_Value = (SELECT AVG(Reading_Value) FROM sensors_data WHERE Device_Type = 'Temperature Sensor') + 10
WHERE Device_Type = 'Temperature Sensor';
```

However, it's worth noting that this query is not efficient for several reasons. 

Firstly, the subquery `AVG(Reading_Value)` is executed once for each row in the table where `Device_Type = 'Temperature Sensor'`, which can be inefficient if there are many rows.

Secondly, even though SQL doesn't support window functions like some other databases (like PostgreSQL or MySQL 8), you still have the option to use a derived table or Common Table Expression (CTE) to avoid executing the subquery separately for each row. 

Lastly, since the subquery always returns the same value (the average reading value of all sensors of type 'Temperature Sensor'), it would be more efficient to store this result in a variable and then update.

Here's how you could do that:

```sql
WITH avg_reading AS (
  SELECT AVG(Reading_Value) as avg_value 
  FROM sensors_data WHERE Device_Type = 'Temperature Sensor'
)
UPDATE sensors_data sd 
SET Reading_Value = (SELECT avg_value FROM avg_reading) + 10
WHERE Device_Type = 'Temperature Sensor';
```

This approach allows the subquery to be executed only once, making it more efficient than the original query.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires CREATE TABLE:

What would be the correct SQL query to create a table called "sensor_data" with columns for device ID, device type, location, battery level, reading value, and timestamp, while also ensuring that the timestamp is stored in a format that can be easily compared and sorted? Should we include any specific constraints or data types for these columns?<start>```sql
-- Create a table called "sensor_data" to store readings from various sensors.
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
    -- 'device_id' will uniquely identify each device sending readings.
    device_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    
    -- The type of device, such as temperature or light sensor.
    device_type VARCHAR(255),

    battery_level INT CHECK(battery_level BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    
    -- The actual reading value from the sensor (e.g., temperature, light intensity).
    reading_value DECIMAL(10,2),
    
    -- Timestamp when the reading was taken.

What SQL command would you use to add a new column named 'Publisher' to the existing table 'books', but only for books published before 1990? The 'books' table currently contains the following columns: Author, Genre, and Publication Year. 

| Author | Genre | Publication Year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thorne Ironwood | Horror | 1964 |
| Rowan Ashborne | Non-Fiction | 1988 |
| Rowan Ashborne | Horror | 1981 |
| Kara Firebrand | Mystery | 2022 |
| Orion Frostblade | Historical | 1970 |
| Isla Windrider | Science Fiction | 1964 |
| Luna Silverleaf | Historical | 1969 |
| Draven Blackthorn | Romance | 2015 |
| Galen Starfire | Science Fiction | 1964 |
| Kara Firebrand | Romance | 2002 |

Note: The table already contains example data, but for this problem, we're only concerned with the structure of the table and how to modify it using SQL.<start>To add a new column named 'Publisher' to the existing table 'books', but only for books published before 1990, you can use an ALTER TABLE command followed by an ADD COLUMN statement in combination with a WHERE clause within the UPDATE statement that adds values for the publisher to rows where publication year is less than 1990. However, since you're specifically looking to add a column, not update existing data based on conditions (which would imply inserting new data into existing rows), we focus on modifying the table structure.

Here's how you can modify your SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE books 
ADD Publisher VARCHAR(255);
```

This command will directly add a new column named 'Publisher' with a type of VARCHAR(255) to the 'books' table. It doesn't apply any condition from the existing data; it simply adds a column that can be populated later by executing an UPDATE statement for relevant rows or through other means such as INSERT operations.

However, if you're interested in understanding how to specifically add values for publishers where publication year is less than 1990, it would look something like this (though adding columns based on existing data conditions isn't typically how databases are structured or updated):

```sql
UPDATE books 
SET Publisher = 'Publisher Name' -- Replace with actual publisher name logic or manual updates
WHERE Publication_Year < 1990;
```

This update statement will populate the new 'Publisher' column with a specified value for rows where publication year is less than 1990. Again, it's essential to understand that this approach does not involve changing the table structure directly; rather, it involves modifying existing data within that structure.

For clarity and adherence to best practices in database design, consider separating logic into two steps:

1. Modify the database schema by adding a 'Publisher' column.
2. Update (or populate) the new 'Publisher' column with relevant values based on conditions or manual updates as needed.

```sql
-- Step 1: Add the Publisher column to books table
ALTER TABLE books 
ADD Publisher VARCHAR(255);

-- Step 2: Populate Publisher column based on publication year condition
UPDATE books 
SET Publisher = 'Some Actual Logic Based On Publication Year'
WHERE Publication_Year < 1990;
```

Please adjust `'Some Actual Logic Based On Publication Year'` to the actual logic or manual updates that suit your specific needs.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem that a programmer might ask for help with:

What is the total fuel used by all trips to Phoenix?<start>To solve this, I'll assume you have a database schema with the following tables and columns:

- `trips` table:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `departure_airport`
  - `arrival_airport`
  - `fuel_used`

Here's a SQL query that would calculate the total fuel used for all trips to Phoenix:

```sql
SELECT SUM(fuel_used) AS total_fuel_used 
FROM trips 
WHERE arrival_airport = 'PHX';
```

This query will sum up the `fuel_used` values for all rows in the `trips` table where the `arrival_airport` is 'PHX', which means all trips that ended in Phoenix.<end>

What SQL query would return a list of all restaurants with their respective cuisines and price ranges, but also include information about which restaurants have online reviews (even if there are no reviews for that particular restaurant) from the Reviews table, where a review is considered "online" if it was posted after 2020?

The relevant tables are:

| Restaurant Name | Cuisine | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BBQ Barn | Japanese | $ |
| Taco Town | Indian | $$$$ |
| Pizza Planet | French | $$ |

And the Reviews table has the following structure:

| Restaurant Name | Review Date |
| --- | --- |
| BBQ Barn | 2022-01-01 |
| Taco Town | 2019-06-15 |
| Pizza Planet | 2021-03-20 |

The Reviews table only contains restaurants that have at least one review.<start>Here is the SQL query that would return a list of all restaurants with their respective cuisines and price ranges, including information about whether each restaurant has online reviews (posted after 2020):

```sql
SELECT 
    r.Restaurant_Name,
    r.Cuisine,
    r.Price_Range,
    CASE WHEN rd.Review_Date IS NOT NULL AND rd.Review_Date > '2020-01-01' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS Has_OnlineReviews
FROM Restaurants r
LEFT JOIN Reviews rd ON r.Restaurant_Name = rd.Restaurant_Name;
```

Here's how the query works:

1. `SELECT` chooses which columns to return.
2. The subquery in `CASE WHEN` checks for online reviews by looking for a review date after 2020 (`> '2020-01-01'`). If such a record exists (i.e., `Review_Date IS NOT NULL`), then it's considered "online" and the query returns `'Yes'`. Otherwise, it returns `'No'`.
3. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all restaurants from the `Restaurants` table are included in the results, even if there are no reviews for them.

This will return a list of restaurants with their cuisines, price ranges, and whether they have online reviews:

| Restaurant Name | Cuisine | Price Range | Has Online Reviews |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BBQ Barn | Japanese | $ | Yes |
| Taco Town | Indian | $$$$ | No |
| Pizza Planet | French | $$ | Yes |

Note that the `LEFT JOIN` prevents null values from being returned for restaurants without online reviews, by replacing them with `'No'`.<end>

What is the total revenue from all orders where the shipping cost is greater than $20 for suppliers that have a name matching 'Umbrella Corp' in the 'suppliers' table? 

The 'orders' and 'suppliers' tables are defined as follows:

Table: orders
| Order ID | Product Name | Price | Shipping Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Smartphone | 291.06 | 10 |
| 2 | Basketball | 379.69 | 15 |
| 3 | Tire | 52.09 | 25 |

Table: suppliers
| Supplier ID | Supplier Name | Total Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Umbrella Corp | 1000 |
| 2 | Wayne Enterprises | 500 |
| 3 | Walmart Inc | 2000 |

The 'suppliers' table needs to be RIGHT JOINed with the 'orders' table on the condition that the supplier's name matches and then the total revenue for each matching order needs to be calculated.<start>To solve this problem, we need to perform a right join between the 'suppliers' and 'orders' tables based on the Supplier Name column in both tables. Then, filter out rows where the shipping cost is less than or equal to $20. Finally, calculate the total revenue from all remaining orders for suppliers with a name matching 'Umbrella Corp'.

Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(o.Order ID) AS total_orders,
    s.Total Revenue + o.Price * o.Shipping Cost AS TotalRevenue
FROM 
    suppliers s
RIGHT JOIN 
    orders o ON s.Supplier Name = o.Product Name
WHERE 
    s.Supplier Name = 'Umbrella Corp' AND
    o.Shipping Cost > 20;
```

This SQL query will return the total number of orders and the total revenue from all orders where the shipping cost is greater than $20 for suppliers with a name matching 'Umbrella Corp'. 

However, looking at the provided data, there are no products named 'Umbrella Corp' in the 'orders' table. The supplier name 'Umbrella Corp' exists in the 'suppliers' table but it's not matched with any order product name.

Therefore, if we assume that you want to get all orders from all suppliers where the shipping cost is greater than $20, and then sum up their revenue:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(o.Order ID) AS total_orders,
    s.Supplier Name AS supplier_name,
    (s.Total Revenue + o.Price * o.Shipping Cost) AS TotalRevenue
FROM 
    suppliers s
RIGHT JOIN 
    orders o ON TRUE
WHERE 
    o.Shipping Cost > 20;
```

In this scenario, the result would be:

| total_orders | supplier_name          | TotalRevenue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NULL       | Umbrella Corp          | 1000 + 52.09 * 25 = 1331.225     |

The total revenue is calculated by adding the supplier's total revenue to the price of each order multiplied by its shipping cost.

Note: In real-world scenarios, it would be beneficial to include a column for calculating total revenue in the 'orders' table itself to avoid such complex operations and joins.<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve the names of all products that have a price higher than $200 and are made by suppliers located in North America (USA, Canada, Mexico)? The table containing product information is "products" with columns: Product Name, SKU, Price, Category, Supplier Name. Assume there is another table called "suppliers_locations" with the following structure:
| Supplier ID | Name | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S001 | Wayne Enterprises | USA |
| S002 | Wonka Industries | Canada |
| S003 | Umbrella Corp | Mexico |
| S004 | ACME Corp | USA |
| S005 | Globex | Mexico |
| S006 | Other Supplier | Europe |

The task is to find the product names where both conditions are met: price > $200 and supplier is from North America.<start>**SQL Query to Retrieve Product Names**
=====================================

To solve this problem, we will use a SQL query that combines two conditions using the `AND` operator:

```sql
SELECT p.Product_Name 
FROM products p
JOIN suppliers_locations s ON p.Supplier_Name = s.Name
WHERE p.Price > 200 AND s.Location IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'Mexico');
```

**How it works:**

1. We select only the `Product_Name` column from the `products` table.
2. We join the `products` table with the `suppliers_locations` table on the condition that the `Supplier_Name` in `products` matches the `Name` in `suppliers_locations`.
3. We filter the results to include only rows where both conditions are met:
	* The product price is higher than $200 (`p.Price > 200`).
	* The supplier location is USA, Canada, or Mexico (`s.Location IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'Mexico')`).

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose the `products` table contains the following data:

| Product Name | SKU | Price | Category | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X-Ray Glasses | G001 | 300 | Fashion | Wonka Industries |
| Time Machine | M002 | 250 | Technology | Umbrella Corp |

And the `suppliers_locations` table contains:

| Supplier ID | Name | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S002 | Wonka Industries | Canada |
| S003 | Umbrella Corp | Mexico |

Running this query will return the following result:

| Product_Name |
| --- |
| X-Ray Glasses |

This is because the product "X-Ray Glasses" has a price higher than $200 and its supplier, Wonka Industries, is located in North America (Canada).<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve all device types with their respective locations, battery levels, reading values, and timestamps for the current date, including devices that have reported data today (i.e., the 'Timestamp' column is within this year) AND those that haven't, even if they're still in our database? Assume we have two tables: 'sensors_readings' with columns:

| Device Type | Location | Battery Level (%) | Reading Value | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motion Detector | Kitchen | 58.0 | -34.41 | 2023-05-23 14:56:40 |
| Temperature Sensor | Bedroom | 65.0 | 6.99 | 2023-05-07 01:18:09 |
| Pressure Sensor | Garage | 52.0 | -23.35 | 2023-08-05 08:11:40 |
| Motion Detector | Garden | 63.6 | -32.6 | 2023-08-16 15:24:32 |
| Pressure Sensor | Living Room | 63.7 | -18.01 | 2022-02-06 11:23:34 |
| Motion Detector | Bathroom | 76.0 | 12.64 | 2021-02-09 23:02:17 |

and another table 'all_sensors' with columns:

| Device Type | Location | Battery Level (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Motion Detector | Kitchen | 58.0 |
| Temperature Sensor | Bedroom | 65.0 |
| Pressure Sensor | Garage | 52.0 |
| Motion Detector | Garden | 63.6 |
| Pressure Sensor | Living Room | 63.7 |
| Motion Detector | Bathroom | 76.0 |

The result should contain all columns and include devices that have reported data today, as well as those that haven't (i.e., have an entry in the 'all_sensors' table).<start>You can use the following SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    ar.Device Type AS Device_Type,
    ar.Location,
    ar.Battery Level (%) AS Battery_Level,
    ar.Reading Value AS Reading_Value,
    ar.Timestamp,
    as.Battery Level (%) AS All_Sensors_Battery_Level
FROM sensors_readings ar
LEFT JOIN all_sensors as ON ar.Device Type = as.Device Type AND ar.Location = as.Location;
```

Here's what this query does:

- `sensors_readings` is the table containing device readings.
- The `LEFT JOIN` operation joins `sensors_readings` with `all_sensors`. It returns all records from the left table (`sensors_readings`) and the matched records from the right table (`all_sensors`). If there's no match, it contains NULL values for the columns of the right table.

However, since you want to include devices that haven't reported data today (i.e., those without an entry in `sensors_readings` within this year), we don't need to filter on timestamp at all. The query will automatically return devices from both tables: ones with a reading for this year and those without.

Note that the timestamp comparison is not needed because the LEFT JOIN operation already includes records from `all_sensors`. If you want, you can use a subquery to get the current date as follows:

```sql
DECLARE @current_date DATE = GETDATE();

SELECT 
    ar.Device Type AS Device_Type,
    ar.Location,
    ar.Battery Level (%) AS Battery_Level,
    ar.Reading Value AS Reading_Value,
    ar.Timestamp,
    as.Battery Level (%) AS All_Sensors_Battery_Level
FROM sensors_readings ar
LEFT JOIN all_sensors as ON ar.Device Type = as.Device Type AND ar.Location = as.Location;
```

This will ensure that the current date is used for any timestamp comparisons, even if this query were part of a larger stored procedure or script.<end>

What is the query to find all the locations where each cuisine type has more than one occurrence, and for those locations, return the cuisine type and the count of occurrences along with a column showing if it's more than one (indicated by 'yes') or not? 

Assuming we have two tables: 'cuisine' and 'location'

| cuisine_id | Cuisine |
| --- | --- |
| 1          | Chinese |
| 2          | American |
| 3          | Mediterranean |
| 4          | Italian |

| location_id | Location | cuisine_id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1        | Lakewood, Colorado       | 1          |
| 2        | Rochester, Minnesota     | 2          |
| 3        | Springdale, Arkansas      | 3          |
| 4        | Ocoee, Florida            | 4          |
| 5        | Wilmington, North Carolina | 1          |
| 6        | Keller, Texas             | 3          |
| 7        | Cape Coral, Florida       | 3          |
| 8        | Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia | 2          |

We need to return the cuisine, count of occurrences, and 'yes' if more than one occurrence or 'no' otherwise.<start>Here is the query that accomplishes what you described:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.Cuisine,
    l.cnt AS Count,
    CASE WHEN l.cnt > 1 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS More_than_one_occurrence
FROM (
    SELECT 
        cuisine_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS cnt, 
        GROUPING(cuisine_id) AS grouping
    FROM location
    GROUP BY cuisine_id WITH ROLLUP
) AS l
JOIN cuisine c ON l.cuisine_id = c.cuisine_id;
```

This query first performs a group by operation on the 'location' table and counts the occurrences of each cuisine type. The `GROUPING` function is used to also include rows where there's no specified cuisine (this would give us all cuisine types if we were doing an outer join later).

Next, it joins this result with the 'cuisine' table to get the actual name of the cuisine.

Finally, a case statement within the select clause gives each cuisine type that occurs more than once its own row in the result set, along with the count of occurrences and whether it has more than one occurrence. If there's no specified cuisine then we also include this row but the `GROUPING` function returns 1 which would be false for our case statement.

However, to simplify the query and reduce the number of rows being processed (which improves performance), you can use a subquery in combination with `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS`:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.Cuisine,
    COALESCE(l.cnt, 0) AS Count,
    IF(l.cnt > 1, 'Yes', 'No') AS More_than_one_occurrence
FROM cuisine c
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        l.cuisine_id,
        COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM location l
    GROUP BY l.cuisine_id
) AS l ON c.cuisine_id = l.cuisine_id;
```

In this revised query, we're doing a `LEFT JOIN` (which returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, or NULL if there's no match). The subquery within it counts occurrences of each cuisine type. Then in the outer select clause we check whether that count is greater than 1.<end>

What SQL query would return a list of all products from "Wonka Industries" that have a name containing the word 'Sports' and have more than 200 stock quantity?<start>Here is the SQL query that meets your requirements:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE manufacturer = 'Wonka Industries'
AND product_name LIKE '%Sports%'
AND stock_quantity > 200;
```
Let me explain what this query does:

* `SELECT * FROM products`: This selects all columns (`*`) from the `products` table.
* `WHERE manufacturer = 'Wonka Industries'`: This filters the results to only include products from "Wonka Industries".
* `AND product_name LIKE '%Sports%'`: This uses a wildcard character (`%`) to match any string that contains the word "Sports" (case-insensitive). The `%` is placed at both ends of the search term, so it will match any string with "Sports" anywhere in it.
* `AND stock_quantity > 200`: This filters the results to only include products with more than 200 stock quantity.

Note: If you're using a database management system that supports regular expressions (like PostgreSQL), you can use a more specific and efficient query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE manufacturer = 'Wonka Industries'
AND product_name ~* '.*sports.*' AND stock_quantity > 200;
```
This uses the `~*` operator to search for any string that matches the regular expression `'.*sports.*'`, which is more precise than using a wildcard character.<end>

What SQL query can be used to select the Company name from the Companies table where there is no value (i.e., NULL) for the Annual Revenue in millions of dollars in the Q1 quarter? 

Table Structure: 
Companies Table
| Company | Sector | Market Cap | Stock Price | Annual Revenue (B) | Quarter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FinanceWorks | Automotive | Mega Cap | 670.25 | 156.67 | Q1 |
| TechCorp | Energy | Mega Cap | 992.2 | 479.41 | Q1 |
| GlobalTrade | Healthcare | Small Cap | 813.62 | 363.01 | Q4 |
| FinanceWorks | Finance | Mega Cap | 833.16 | 104.9 | Q1 |
| FinanceWorks | Aerospace | Small Cap | 294.43 | 187.02 | Q3 |
| AeroSpace | Healthcare | Large Cap | 482.29 | 51.42 | Q3 |

Data Type:
- Annual Revenue (B) = Currency (in Billions)
- Market Cap = Currency (in Billions)
- Stock Price = Currency (in billions)<start>**SQL Query to Select Companies with No Value for Q1 Annual Revenue**

```sql
SELECT Company
FROM Companies
WHERE Annual_Revenue_B IS NULL AND Quarter = 'Q1';
```

**Explanation:**

* `Annual_Revenue_B IS NULL` checks if the value is null in the `Annual Revenue (B)` column.
* `AND Quarter = 'Q1'` filters the results to only include rows where the quarter is Q1.

**Note:** 

* We use `IS NULL` instead of `=` to check for null values, because `=` would return false if the value is an empty string or a zero, whereas `IS NULL` checks for actual null values.
* If you're using a database system that uses double quotes for identifiers (e.g., PostgreSQL), you'll need to wrap the table and column names in double quotes. However, since the problem description mentions a standard SQL syntax, I've used backticks (`) to denote the column name.

**Example Use Case:**

Running this query on your Companies table will return the Company name for each company where there is no value (i.e., NULL) for the Annual Revenue in millions of dollars in the Q1 quarter.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all rows from the "Products" table where the "Supplier Name" exists and is NOT NULL for each distinct "Category", sorted by the "Category" in ascending order? 

| Product Name | Price | Category | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gadget | 420.91 | Household | Globex |
| Gizmo | 146.63 | Household | Wonka Industries |
| Gizmo | 18.48 | Automotive | Umbrella Corp |
| Gizmo | 280.33 | Sports | Globex |
| Thingamajig | 210.09 | Sports | Wayne Enterprises |
| Widget | 116.78 | Sports | ACME Corp |
| Contraption | 111.61 | Household | Globex |

Note: The "Products" table has the columns: Product Name, Price, Category, and Supplier Name.<start>Here is a SQL query that will return all rows from the "Products" table where the "Supplier Name" exists and is NOT NULL for each distinct "Category", sorted by the "Category" in ascending order:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE SupplierName IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Category
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ProductName) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ProductName)
                                      FROM Products 
                                      WHERE SupplierName IS NOT NULL)
ORDER BY Category ASC;
```
Here's an explanation of how the query works:

1. `SELECT *`: We want to retrieve all columns (`*`) for each row that meets the conditions.
2. `FROM Products`: This specifies the table we're querying.
3. `WHERE SupplierName IS NOT NULL`: We only want rows where the "Supplier Name" is not null, as per the problem statement.
4. `GROUP BY Category`: We group the results by the "Category" column.
5. `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ProductName) = ...`: This is a bit tricky. We're counting the number of distinct product names within each category where the supplier name is not null. We want to ensure that all categories have at least one product with a non-null supplier name. To do this, we use a subquery (the inner `SELECT`) to count the total number of distinct product names across all rows where the supplier name is not null. Then, in the outer query, we group by category and check if the count of distinct product names within each category is equal to the total count from the subquery.
6. `ORDER BY Category ASC`: Finally, we sort the results by the "Category" column in ascending order.

This query should return all rows where the supplier name is not null for each distinct category, sorted by category in ascending order.<end>

What is the average income of people from Florida and Texas who have an age greater than 40, grouped by birth month, with a HAVING clause applied to filter out birth months with less than two individuals meeting this condition? The relevant tables and columns are:

Table: People
| Name | Age | Birth Month | City | State | Income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Joann | 38 | August | Cicero | Florida | 485000 |
| Wendell | 49 | June | Moore | Texas | 360000 |
| Christina | 33 | March | Murray | Arizona | 250000 |
| Rick | 49 | September | Gulfport | New Jersey | 145000 |

Note: For simplicity, only four people are listed in the table.<start>To answer this question, we need to filter out the records of individuals aged greater than 40 from Florida and Texas who meet our condition.

Here's how you could query it using SQL:

```sql
SELECT AVG(Income) as AverageIncome 
FROM People 
WHERE Age > 40 AND State IN ('Florida', 'Texas')
GROUP BY BirthMonth 
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
```

However, given the data provided, there is a problem with this query. There are no individuals from Florida or Texas aged greater than 40 with a birth month that meets the conditions for this query.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with a OVER window function:

What is the average duration for each unique end location of the trips, ordered from shortest to longest, along with the row number and percentage of total durations? 

| Trip Name | Start Location | End Location | Distance (miles) | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Highway Odyssey | Denver | Houston | 1129.7 | 59.6 | 60.4 |
| Desert Drive | Houston | Los Angeles | 1654.9 | 7.5 | 87.4 |
| Valley Voyage | Los Angeles | Denver | 371.6 | 2.4 | 26.9 |
| City Explorer | Phoenix | Chicago | 1382.6 | 62.8 | 8.2 |
| Desert Drive | Denver | Los Angeles | 296.6 | 62.2 | 91.1 |
| City Explorer | Houston | Denver | 2199.1 | 15.3 | 60.0 |
| Historic Route | Denver | San Francisco | 2445.4 | 35.3 | 91.1 |
| Mountain Adventure | Los Angeles | Denver | 2175.8 | 53.3 | 96.0 |
| Valley Voyage | Los Angeles | San Francisco | 577.6 | 70.9 | 97.1 |

The required output should include the following columns:
- End Location
- Average Duration (hours)
- Row Number
- Percentage of Total Durations (%)<start>Here is the SQL query that solves this problem:

```sql
SELECT 
    End_Location,
    AVG(Duration) OVER(PARTITION BY End_Location) AS Average_Duration_hours,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(Duration) OVER(PARTITION BY End_Location)) AS Row_Number,
    (AVG(Duration) OVER(PARTITION BY End_Location) / SUM(AVG(Duration)) OVER()) * 100 AS Percentage_of_Total_Durations
FROM 
    Trips
ORDER BY 
    Average_Duration_hours;
```

Explanation:

- The PARTITION BY clause groups the rows by `End Location`, so that each group of rows contains all the trips ending at a particular location.
- The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique number to each row within each partition (group), based on the order specified in the ORDER BY clause. In this case, we're ordering by the average duration for each end location.
- The SUM(AVG(Duration)) OVER() calculates the total sum of durations across all rows.
- The AVG(Duration) OVER(PARTITION BY End_Location) / SUM(AVG(Duration)) OVER() expression computes the percentage of total durations for each group (end location).
- Finally, we're ordering the output by Average_Duration_hours. This will give us the shortest to longest average duration order.

This SQL query assumes that you have a table named "Trips" with columns `End_Location`, `Duration`.<end>

What is the total fuel used and percentage difference between consecutive records in the "Fuel Consumption" table where the distance traveled is greater than 2000 miles, along with the previous record's fuel usage, assuming a consistent speed of 60 mph? 

Table: FuelConsumption
| Distance (miles) | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2789.5 | 52.3 | 15.9 |
| 2274.8 | 19.8 | 78.2 |
| 53.5 | 14.8 | 20.6 |
| 1294.2 | 56.4 | 24.5 |
| 2363.4 | 1.5 | 91.5 |
| 521.2 | 13.4 | 42.6 |
| 746.5 | 48.2 | 84.0 |
| 2747.1 | 5.5 | 93.3 |

Note: Assuming a consistent speed of 60 mph, the time it takes to travel 2000 miles can be calculated as 2000 / 60 = 33.33 hours. So, all records where Distance > 2000 should be considered in the result.<start>To calculate the total fuel used and percentage difference between consecutive records for distances greater than 2000 miles, we need to filter the table based on this condition.

## Step 1: Filter the data
We start by identifying rows from the "Fuel Consumption" table where the distance traveled is greater than 2000 miles. This involves selecting relevant rows based on the given criterion.

## Step 2: Calculate time for 2000 miles at 60 mph
For any record, we need to calculate how long it would take to travel 2000 miles at a constant speed of 60 mph. The formula is Distance / Speed = Time. So, for 2000 miles, it takes 2000 / 60 hours.

## Step 3: Calculate fuel usage per hour
Once we know the time taken to cover 2000 miles (which would be approximately 33.33 hours), we can calculate how much fuel is used on average per hour by dividing the total fuel used in a trip by the duration of that trip. However, since we're looking at distances above 2000 miles and their relation to this standard, our main focus shifts towards understanding the fuel consumption patterns for such trips without necessarily calculating an hourly rate but rather comparing consecutive records.

## Step 4: Analyze the table
Let's analyze each row where Distance > 2000:

1. For 2789.5 miles, with a duration of 52.3 hours and Fuel Used = 15.9 gallons.
2. For 2274.8 miles, with a duration of 19.8 hours and Fuel Used = 78.2 gallons.
3. For 2363.4 miles, with a duration of 1.5 hours and Fuel Used = 91.5 gallons.

## Step 5: Perform percentage difference calculations
Now, we'll calculate the percentage difference in fuel usage for consecutive records where distance is greater than 2000 miles:

- Between 2789.5 and 2274.8 miles:
  - Percentage difference = ((78.2 - 15.9) / 15.9) * 100.
  
- Between 2274.8 and 2363.4 miles:
  - First, note that the distance is not consecutively increasing in a manner expected for consistent speed (60 mph), but since we're looking at fuel consumption as per records provided, let's correct this observation: The record after 2274.8 miles is actually further away than the one before it would be if traveling at 60 mph; however, our task specifically asks for percentage difference between consecutive records where distance > 2000, so focusing on given data:
  - Since we have actual fuel consumption values and not a continuous increase in mileage or time that would naturally align with 60 mph speed (which was used to frame this problem), let's address the direct question: The next record after 2274.8 miles (with 2363.4 miles) shows a significantly higher fuel usage.

## Step 6: Calculate total fuel used
To calculate the total fuel used for distances greater than 2000 miles, we add up the fuel consumption values from relevant records:

- Total Fuel Used = 15.9 + 78.2 + 91.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{185.6}$<end>

Here is an example SQL problem:

What is the average stock quantity of each product across all suppliers that have a supplier name starting with the letter "A", grouped by product and then ordered by this average stock quantity in descending order?<start>To solve this problem, we can use a combination of `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses. Here's how you could do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    P.product_name,
    AVG(SQ.quantity) AS average_stock_quantity
FROM 
    products P
JOIN 
    stock_quantities SQ ON P.product_id = SQ.product_id
WHERE 
    S.supplier_name LIKE 'A%'
GROUP BY 
    P.product_name
ORDER BY 
    average_stock_quantity DESC;
```

This query:

- **Joins** the `products` table with the `stock_quantities` table on their respective `product_id`.
- **Filters** only those rows where the supplier name starts with "A" using a `LIKE` operator.
- **Groups** the results by product name.
- **Calculates** the average stock quantity for each group of products.
- Finally, **orders** the result in descending order based on the average stock quantity.

However, since we need to ensure that we're only considering suppliers whose names start with "A", this query would require knowing which table holds supplier information. Since it was not provided in the prompt, I assumed the existence of a `suppliers` table (S) and used its `supplier_name` column for filtering.

If you don't have a separate `suppliers` table, but rather supplier info is embedded within another table or even the same table as stock quantities, you might need to adjust the query accordingly.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem:

What SQL query would you use to get a list of all trips ordered by their duration in descending order (longest trip first), followed by a secondary sort based on the distance traveled in ascending order?<start>To solve this, we will assume that the table containing information about trips is named `trips`. The columns for duration and distance are assumed to be named `duration` and `distance`, respectively. The SQL query to get the desired output would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM trips
ORDER BY duration DESC,
         distance ASC;
```

This will first sort the rows based on the `duration` in descending order (`DESC`) to prioritize longer trips. If two or more trips have the same duration, then they will be sorted by the `distance` traveled in ascending order (`ASC`).<end>

What SQL query would return the total price of all products in each category, grouping by the product category and only including categories that have a total stock quantity greater than 1000?<start>Here is the SQL query that meets your requirements:
```sql
SELECT 
  p.category,
  SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_price
FROM 
  products p
JOIN 
  orders o ON p.id = o.product_id
GROUP BY 
  p.category
HAVING 
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.category) > 1000;
```
However, this query would only return categories that have at least one order with a quantity of more than 1000.

A better approach is to calculate the total stock quantity for each category separately and then filter the result based on the condition. Here's how you can do it:
```sql
SELECT 
  p.category,
  SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_price
FROM 
  products p
JOIN 
  orders o ON p.id = o.product_id
GROUP BY 
  p.category
HAVING 
  SUM(o.quantity) > 1000;
```
In this query, we're using the `SUM(o.quantity)` expression to calculate the total stock quantity for each category. The `HAVING` clause then filters the result to include only categories with a total stock quantity greater than 1000.

Note: Replace `products`, `orders` and their respective columns with your actual table names and column names.<end>

What SQL command would you use to drop the "Stocks" table from a database where it currently has 10 rows of data and the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Stocks (
    Company VARCHAR(255),
    Sector VARCHAR(100),
    Market_Cap VARCHAR(15),
    Stock_Price DECIMAL(5,2),
    Annual_Revenue_BILLION DECIMAL(7,2),
    Quarter VARCHAR(20)
);

INSERT INTO Stocks (Company, Sector, Market_Cap, Stock_Price, Annual_Revenue_Billion, Quarter) 
VALUES ('AeroSpace', 'Retail', 'Small Cap', 623.73, 174.05, 'Q3'),
('TechCorp', 'Finance', 'Mega Cap', 922.57, 190.38, 'Q2'),
('EcoEnergy', 'Healthcare', 'Mid Cap', 831.7, 360.87, 'Q4'),
('BioPharm', 'Automotive', 'Small Cap', 599.45, 130.99, 'Q4'),
('Foodies', 'Finance', 'Mega Cap', 735.62, 450.25, 'Q4'),
('EcoEnergy', 'Technology', 'Mid Cap', 405.98, 450.25, 'Q4'),
('RetailHub', 'Biotech', 'Small Cap', 335.15, 492.77, 'Q3'),
('EcoEnergy', 'Biotech', 'Large Cap', 352.85, 247.69, 'Q1'),
('AutoDrive', 'Automotive', 'Large Cap', 963.96, 65.81, 'Q1'),
('AeroSpace', 'Finance', 'Mid Cap', 27.06, 173.96, 'Q3');
```

The table needs to be dropped before a new table with the same name can be created to hold updated data from an external source?<start>You would use the `DROP TABLE` SQL command to delete the "Stocks" table and all its contents. Here is how you could do it:

```sql
DROP TABLE Stocks;
```

**Note:** Before dropping a table, make sure that there are no dependent objects (e.g., views, stored procedures, triggers) referencing this table.

To drop a table with rows of data safely, you may want to check the following:

1. Ensure you have write permissions on the database.
2. Verify the name and structure of your table match exactly what's specified in the `DROP TABLE` command.
3. Be aware that dropping a table is permanent and irretrievable; backup your database before proceeding.

To drop the table and then create a new one with the same name, you could chain these two SQL commands:

```sql
DROP TABLE Stocks;
CREATE TABLE Stocks (
    Company VARCHAR(255),
    Sector VARCHAR(100),
    Market_Cap VARCHAR(15),
    Stock_Price DECIMAL(5,2),
    Annual_Revenue_BILLION DECIMAL(7,2),
    Quarter VARCHAR(20)
);
```

After dropping the table and creating a new one with the same name, you can then insert data into this new "Stocks" table from an external source.<end>

What SQL statement would you use to insert a new book into the 'books' table with the following details: title = "The Lost City", author = "Eira Shadowglow", genre = "Fantasy", publication year = 2018, and rating = 3.5? The books table has the following structure:

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

And there are existing records in the 'books' table as shown above.<start>To insert a new book into the `books` table, you would use an INSERT statement that includes all the necessary details (title, author, genre, publication year, and rating). Here's how you can do it:

```sql
INSERT INTO books (Title, Author, Genre, Publication_Year, Rating)
VALUES ('The Lost City', 'Eira Shadowglow', 'Fantasy', 2018, 3.5);
```

This SQL statement directly inserts the specified book into the `books` table with all its details as provided.

Note: The column names (`Title`, `Author`, etc.) are written in uppercase because it seems like the table structure defines them this way (common practice for SQL to avoid confusion between column names and actual values). If your database system uses a different case convention, adjust accordingly.<end>

What SQL query would you use to remove all records from the 'Sensor Readings' table where the 'Device Type' is either a 'Temperature Sensor' in the 'Garage' location, regardless of the battery level, or when the battery level drops below 20% and the 'Reading Value' exceeds 80?<start>You can use the following SQL query to remove all records from the 'Sensor Readings' table that meet either of the specified conditions:

```sql
DELETE FROM Sensor_Readings 
WHERE (Device_Type = 'Temperature Sensor' AND Location = 'Garage') OR 
      ((Battery_Level < 20 AND Reading_Value > 80));
```

This query uses the `OR` operator to combine two separate conditions. The first condition targets records where the device type is a temperature sensor and the location is the garage, regardless of the battery level. The second condition targets records where the battery level drops below 20% and the reading value exceeds 80%.<end>

What SQL query would update the 'Rating' of every book written by author Orion Frostblade to be higher than the average rating of his books? The table in question is called "Books" and has the columns Title (the name of the book), Author (the name of the author who wrote the book), Genre (the type of book), Publication Year (the year the book was published), and Rating (a numerical value representing how well-received the book was).<start>Here is the SQL query that would update the 'Rating' of every book written by author Orion Frostblade to be higher than the average rating of his books:

```sql
UPDATE Books
SET Rating = Rating + 
            (SELECT AVG(Rating) FROM Books WHERE Author = 'Orion Frostblade') * 2 - 1
WHERE Author = 'Orion Frostblade';
```

However, since we're trying to update each book's rating to be higher than the average rating of Orion Frostblade's books, we'll need a bit more logic. Here is how you can modify it:

```sql
UPDATE Books
SET Rating = CASE 
                 WHEN Author = 'Orion Frostblade' THEN 
                     IFNULL((SELECT AVG(Rating) FROM Books WHERE Author = 'Orion Frostblade'), 0) + 1
                 ELSE Rating
               END;
```

This query will update the rating of each book written by Orion Frostblade to be higher than the average rating of his books. If a new average is not found, it uses the current rating + 1 as the updated rating. 

Note: The `IFNULL` function and `CASE` statement used above are MySQL specific. You may need to modify this query according to your SQL dialect's syntax for similar functions.

For more general SQL queries that can be applied across different databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), consider using the following:

```sql
UPDATE Books
SET Rating = CASE 
                 WHEN Author = 'Orion Frostblade' THEN 
                     COALESCE((SELECT AVG(Rating) FROM Books WHERE Author = 'Orion Frostblade'), 0) + 1
                 ELSE Rating
               END;
```

This is a more portable version that can work across different databases.<end>

What is a SQL query that creates a table called "Movies" with columns for "Title", "Genre", and "Rating", where the "Title" column contains unique movie titles, and then inserts the following data into this new table: 

| Title | Genre | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Shining | Horror | 4.9 |
| The Matrix | Science Fiction | 2.2 |
| The Silence of the Lambs | Thriller | 1.9 |
| The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo | Mystery | 3.8 |
| The Martian | Science Fiction | 5.0 |
| The Avengers | Fantasy | 4.2 |
| Inception | Science Fiction | 4.9 |

Note: This data should be used to create a new table, and not update an existing one.<start>**Creating the Movies Table and Inserting Data**

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
-- Create the Movies table with unique titles constraint
CREATE TABLE Movies (
  Title VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  Genre VARCHAR(50),
  Rating DECIMAL(3,2)
);

-- Insert data into the Movies table
INSERT INTO Movies (Title, Genre, Rating)
VALUES 
('The Shining', 'Horror', 4.9),
('The Matrix', 'Science Fiction', 2.2),
('The Silence of the Lambs', 'Thriller', 1.9),
('The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo', 'Mystery', 3.8),
('The Martian', 'Science Fiction', 5.0),
('The Avengers', 'Fantasy', 4.2),
('Inception', 'Science Fiction', 4.9);
```

**Explanation**

*   We start by creating a new table named "Movies". The `Title` column is defined as the primary key, ensuring that each title can only be used once in this table.
*   The `Genre` and `Rating` columns are simply defined with suitable data types (`VARCHAR(50)` for genre and `DECIMAL(3,2)` for rating).
*   Then we insert the specified data into the "Movies" table using the `INSERT INTO` statement. Each row of data is enclosed within parentheses and separated by commas.

**Note**: This query assumes that you are working in a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL that supports SQL syntax similar to this. The specific DBMS being used may require slight variations in syntax.<end>

What SQL command would I use to add a new column 'Device Type' to an existing table named 'Sensor_Readings', which currently contains columns for Device ID, Location, Battery Level (%), Reading Value, and Timestamp? The newly added column should be able to hold either a string value ('Temperature' or 'Humidity') representing the type of device that sent each reading.<start>You can use the following SQL command to add a new column to an existing table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Sensor_Readings
ADD Device_Type VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '';
```

However, it's generally good practice to specify the exact length for string columns in most databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL). The `VARCHAR(255)` is often considered too large and can cause issues if you're not careful. 

Let's assume that 'Temperature' or 'Humidity' are your only options. In this case, it would be better to use a smaller integer column with an enum data type:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Sensor_Readings
ADD Device_Type TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0;
```

But if you're using SQL Server (which doesn't have a built-in `ENUM` type like MySQL or PostgreSQL), then you'd use:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Sensor_Readings
ADD Device_Type INT NOT NULL CHECK (Device_Type IN (0, 1));
```

Or for any database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Sensor_Readings
ADD Device_Type TINYINT;
```

You would also need to insert values into this new column. This is typically done using a `SELECT` statement with a `CASE` expression.

Here's an example of how you might do that in SQL Server or other databases:

```sql
UPDATE Sensor_Readings 
SET Device_Type = 
    CASE 
        WHEN Device_ID IN (/*Temperature ID*/)
            THEN 0
        ELSE 1 
    END;
```

Please note, `Device_ID IN (/*Temperature ID*/)`, replace `(/*Temperature ID*/)` with actual values of temperature device IDs.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all stocks with an annual revenue of more than $200 billion in Q3? 

Stocks table:
- Sector (string)
- Stock Price (float)
- Annual Revenue (B) (float)
- Quarter (string)

Note: The Quarter column only contains the quarters 'Q1', 'Q2', and 'Q3'.<start>Here is a SQL query that will return all stocks with an annual revenue of more than $200 billion in Q3:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Stocks
WHERE Annual Revenue (B) > 200 AND Quarter = 'Q3';
```

However, note that the actual column name `Annual Revenue (B)` might not be enclosed in parentheses. If it's a separate column named `Annual_Revenue_B` or just `AnnualRevenueB`, you should replace it with the correct column name.

Also, since SQL is case-sensitive for most databases, it's generally a good practice to use uppercase for table and column names (if your database doesn't handle them as-is).

This query works by selecting all columns (`*`) from the `Stocks` table where two conditions are met:

1. The annual revenue of each stock must be greater than $200 billion (`Annual Revenue (B) > 200`).
2. The quarter of each stock must be Q3 (`Quarter = 'Q3'`).<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve the restaurant name, cuisine, location, and rating for all restaurants in California along with the total number of customers served by each restaurant in the last month from a table called "california_reviews" that contains the following columns: 
| Date | Restaurant Name | Customers Served |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2022-02-01 | Burger Haven | 100 |
| 2022-02-05 | Taco Town | 200 |
| 2022-02-10 | The Steakhouse | 50 |
| 2022-02-12 | Pasta Palace | 150 |
| 2022-02-20 | Curry Corner | 75 |

The california_reviews table also has a column called "restaurant_id" which is used to identify the restaurant, and it matches the id in another table called "restaurants".<start>To achieve this, you'll need to join the `california_reviews` table with the `restaurants` table based on the `restaurant_id`, then filter for restaurants in California. You can use a subquery or a JOIN to get the total number of customers served by each restaurant in the last month.

However, since your question does not provide information about the "cuisine", "location", and "rating" columns, I'll assume they are present in the `restaurants` table based on their names. If that's not the case, you'll need to adjust the query accordingly.

Here is a sample SQL query using MySQL syntax:

```sql
SELECT 
  r.Name AS Restaurant_Name,
  r.Cuisine,
  l.Location,
  r.Rating,
  cr.Customers_Served,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM california_reviews WHERE restaurant_id = cr.restaurant_id AND Date > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) AS Total_Customers_Last_Month
FROM 
  restaurants r 
  INNER JOIN locations l ON r.id = l.id
  INNER JOIN california_reviews cr ON r.id = cr.restaurant_id
WHERE 
  l.State = 'California';
```

This query will give you the restaurant name, cuisine, location, rating, and total customers served by each restaurant in the last month.

However, since your question is asking to count the number of customers for the last month separately, this can be achieved using a subquery with the COUNT() function. 

Please note that this query assumes that all locations have their own separate row in the `locations` table and there's no ambiguity about which location goes with which restaurant.

Also note, you might need to modify the join conditions or add more joins based on your actual database schema and requirements.

For example, if the "cuisine", "location", and "rating" are directly present in the `california_reviews` table:

```sql
SELECT 
  cr.Restaurant_Name,
  cr.Cuisine,
  l.Location,
  cr.Rating,
  cr.Customers_Served,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM california_reviews WHERE restaurant_id = cr.restaurant_id AND Date > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) AS Total_Customers_Last_Month
FROM 
  california_reviews cr 
  INNER JOIN locations l ON r.id = l.id  -- you need to have the restaurant id in location table
WHERE 
  l.State = 'California';
```

This will also give you the desired result.<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve all devices that have a reading value greater than 50.00 along with their corresponding device types and reading values from the "Device_Reading" table, but also include information about the device's location (device ID) from the "Device_Location" table if there is any matching device type? The Device_Location table has the following structure:

| Device ID | Location |
| --- | --- |
| device-0078 | Warehouse A |
| device-0067 | Factory Floor |
| device-0019 | Warehouse B |
| device-0008 | Storage Room |
| device-0071 | Laboratory |
| device-0042 | Warehouse C |

The Device_Reading table has the following structure:

| Device ID | Device Type | Reading Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| device-0078 | Humidity Sensor | 83.55 |
| device-0067 | Light Sensor | 64.93 |
| device-0019 | Motion Detector | 83.55 |
| device-0008 | Motion Detector | 24.37 |
| device-0071 | Temperature Sensor | 49.43 |
| device-0042 | Motion Detector | 69.37 |<start>To solve this problem, you'll use a SQL query that combines information from the `Device_Reading` table with location details from the `Device_Location` table based on matching device types in a subquery or by joining both tables on the condition of matching device IDs for each device type. The goal is to get all devices where the reading value exceeds 50, their device types, and also include location information if any match is found.

Assuming that you want to retrieve data from `Device_Reading` and join it with `Device_Location` based on the common column (`device ID`), but only consider locations for a specific device type (let's say `Motion Detector`) as an example of how you could filter by device type:

```sql
SELECT 
  dr.Device_ID, 
  dr.Device_Type, 
  dr.Reading_Value, 
  dl.Location 
FROM 
  Device_Reading AS dr 
  LEFT JOIN Device_Location AS dl ON dr.Device_ID = dl.Device_ID AND dl.Location IN (SELECT Location FROM Device_Location WHERE Device_ID IN (SELECT Device_ID FROM Device_Reading WHERE Device_Type = 'Motion Detector'))
WHERE 
  dr.Reading_Value > 50.00;
```

However, the above query might not be perfect in this context because it's using a subquery to filter locations based on device types in `Device_Location`, which could limit or change results without being directly tied to your filtering condition (`Reading Value > 50.00`). A more straightforward and accurate approach would involve joining both tables once, matching the condition you're interested in (device type), and then selecting data from `Device_Reading` that meets the given criteria while including location details if there's a match:

```sql
SELECT 
  dr.Device_ID, 
  dr.Device_Type, 
  dr.Reading_Value, 
  dl.Location 
FROM 
  Device_Reading AS dr 
  LEFT JOIN Device_Location AS dl ON dr.Device_ID = dl.Device_ID AND dr.Device_Type = 'Motion Detector'
WHERE 
  (dr.Device_Type = 'Motion Detector' AND dr.Reading_Value > 50.00) OR (dr.Device_Type != 'Motion Detector' AND dr.Reading_Value > 50.00);
```

This query simply checks for two conditions:
1. If the device type is `Motion Detector`, it selects all readings over 50.
2. For any other device type, if its reading is also over 50.

The above SQL queries are examples of how you could achieve your goal with a focus on filtering by reading value and incorporating location details where the specific condition (in this case, motion detector) matches in `Device_Location`. The actual query might vary slightly based on your database system's specifics and exact requirements.<end>

What is the average rating of each movie genre, including only genres that have at least two movies in the "Movies" table with an INNER JOIN to the "Ratings" table on the condition that the "Title" column matches exactly between both tables? 

Table 1: Movies
| Title | Genre |
| --- | --- |
| Echoes of Eternity | Romance |
| A Journey Through Time | Historical |
| Shadows of Solitude | Fantasy |
| The Crystal Key | Science Fiction |
| The Forgotten World | Horror |
| The Last Sky | Historical |
| A Journey Through Time | Horror |

Table 2: Ratings
| Title | Rating |
| --- | --- |
| Echoes of Eternity | 4.8 |
| A Journey Through Time | 4.4 |
| Shadows of Solitude | 1.7 |
| The Crystal Key | 2.5 |
| The Forgotten World | 2.7 |
| The Last Sky | 3.0 |
| A Journey Through Time | 2.5 |

Note: The Ratings table contains only one rating per movie, and the Movies table does not contain any ratings.<start>Here is how you can calculate the average rating for each movie genre.

```sql
SELECT 
    g.Genre,
    AVG(r.Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM 
    Movies m
INNER JOIN 
    Ratings r ON m.Title = r.Title
GROUP BY 
    g.Genre
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT m.Title) > 1;
```

This query works as follows:

- First, we join the `Movies` table with the `Ratings` table on the condition that the `Title` column matches exactly between both tables.
- Then, we group the results by the `Genre` column from the `Movies` table.
- The `HAVING` clause is used to filter out genres that have less than two movies in the `Movies` table with an INNER JOIN to the `Ratings` table on the condition that the "Title" column matches exactly between both tables.<end>

What SQL query can be used to combine all companies listed in two tables - "stock_info" which contains information about publicly traded companies and their market capitalization, and "quarterly_performance" which lists quarterly performance data for these same companies? The stock_info table has the following columns: Company (string), Market Cap (enum Large, Mid, Small), while the quarterly_performance table has the following columns: Company (string), Quarter (string). 

The query should select the Company name and its corresponding quarter from both tables, even if there is no entry for a company in one or both of the tables.<start>**SQL Query to Combine Companies from Two Tables**

To combine all companies listed in both `stock_info` and `quarterly_performance` tables, we can use a `FULL OUTER JOIN`. This type of join returns all records from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there's no match.

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(si.Company, qp.Company) AS Company,
    COALESCE(qp.Quarter, si.Market_Cap) AS Quarter
FROM 
    stock_info si
FULL OUTER JOIN 
    quarterly_performance qp ON si.Company = qp.Company;
```

**Explanation:**

* `COALESCE` is used to replace NULL values with a default value (in this case, the column from the other table).
* The `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all records from both tables, even if there's no match.
* We join on the `Company` column, which is common in both tables.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose we have the following data:

```sql
-- stock_info table
+---------+-------------+
| Company | Market Cap  |
+---------+-------------+
| Apple   | Large       |
| Google  | Mid         |
| Amazon  | Small       |
| Tesla   | Large       |
+---------+-------------+

-- quarterly_performance table
+---------+--------+
| Company | Quarter|
+---------+--------+
| Apple   | Q1     |
| Apple   | Q2     |
| Google  | Q3     |
| Tesla   | Q4     |
+---------+--------+
```

The query will return:

```sql
+---------+--------+
| Company | Quarter|
+---------+--------+
| Amazon  | NULL   |
| Apple   | Q1     |
| Apple   | Q2     |
| Google  | Q3     |
| Tesla   | Q4     |
+---------+--------+
```

As you can see, the query returns all companies from both tables, even if there's no entry for a company in one or both tables.<end>

What is a SQL query that uses a self JOIN to retrieve all supplier names and their corresponding prices for each product (represented by 'SKU') where at least two suppliers are offering it, excluding products offered by Wonka Industries? Assume we have the following table structure in our database:

**Products Table:**

| SKU | Price | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SKU-1073 | 258.93 | Wayne Enterprises |
| SKU-1098 | 447.31 | Wonka Industries |
| SKU-1029 | 358.2 | Wonka Industries |
| SKU-1077 | 442.11 | Globex |
| SKU-1027 | 312.55 | ACME Corp |

**Products Table (continued):**

| SKU | Price | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SKU-1001 | 258.93 | Wayne Enterprises |
| SKU-1059 | 447.31 | Wonka Industries |
| SKU-1088 | 358.2 | ACME Corp |
| SKU-1035 | 442.11 | Globex |
| SKU-1104 | 312.55 | ACME Corp |

Note: The table has been extended to include additional products and suppliers for clarity in problem presentation, but the actual query should only consider the provided example data.<start>Here's a SQL query that uses a self JOIN to retrieve all supplier names and their corresponding prices for each product (represented by 'SKU') where at least two suppliers are offering it, excluding products offered by Wonka Industries:

```sql
SELECT 
    p1.Supplier Name AS Supplier1,
    p2.Price AS PriceSupplier1,
    p3.Supplier Name AS Supplier2,
    p4.Price AS PriceSupplier2
FROM 
    Products p1
JOIN 
    Products p2 ON (p1.SKU = p2.SKU AND p1.Supplier Name != 'Wonka Industries')
JOIN 
    Products p3 ON (p2.SKU = p3.SKU AND p2.Supplier Name != 'Wonka Industries' AND p2.Price = p4.Price)
WHERE 
    p1.SKU NOT IN (SELECT SKU FROM Products WHERE Supplier Name = 'Wonka Industries')
GROUP BY 
    p1.SKU
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT p3.Supplier Name) > 1;
```

This query works as follows:

- The `JOIN` statement joins the table with itself on two conditions:
  - Both `SKU`s match.
  - Both supplier names are not 'Wonka Industries'.
  
- The third join is also based on matching `SKU`s, and also matches both supplier names which are not 'Wonka Industries' and have the same price.

- The final query filters out products offered by Wonka Industries using a subquery (`WHERE p1.SKU NOT IN ...`).

- To group by SKU only when at least two suppliers offer it, use `GROUP BY p1.SKU`. 

However this query won't return all supplier names for each product because you're grouping by the first occurrence of the supplier name that matches the condition. If you want to get a list of all supplier names and their prices (regardless of whether they match the conditions), consider using an aggregation function like `MIN` or `MAX`.<end>

What SQL query would return all companies from the `stock_data` table where the company name starts with "H" and the stock price is greater than $500? The table includes columns for `Company`, `Sector`, `Market Cap`, `Stock Price`, and `Quarter`.<start>Here is the SQL query that returns all companies from the `stock_data` table where the company name starts with "H" and the stock price is greater than $500:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM stock_data
WHERE Company LIKE 'H%' AND Stock Price > 500;
```

In this query, we're using the `LIKE` operator to match the company names that start with "H". The `%` wildcard character matches any characters after "H", so it's equivalent to saying "starts with H".

Note: We're assuming a numeric type for `Stock Price`. If it's a string (e.g. currency format), we'd need to adjust the condition accordingly.

Alternatively, if you want to use a more SQL-standard way of writing this query without specific syntax for the LIKE operator:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM stock_data
WHERE Company STARTS WITH 'H' AND Stock Price > 500;
```

Note: The `STARTS WITH` keyword is not widely supported in all databases, especially older ones. For most use cases, the first one should be good enough.<end>

What is a SQL query that selects all records from the "device_readings" table where the "Battery Level (%)" is NULL, but excludes records with a "Reading Value" of -10.96? The "device_readings" table has columns for "Device ID", "Location", "Battery Level (%)", "Reading Value", and "Timestamp".<start>Here is a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM device_readings
WHERE Battery_Level IS NULL AND Reading_Value <> -10.96;
```

This query selects all records from the `device_readings` table where the `Battery_Level` column is `NULL`, and excludes any records with a `Reading_Value` of `-10.96`. The `<>` operator is used for inequality, which is equivalent to "not equal" in most SQL databases.

Note: In some SQL dialects (such as MySQL), the syntax would be slightly different:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM device_readings
WHERE Battery_Level IS NULL AND Reading_Value != -10.96;
```

This is because `!=` is used for inequality instead of `<>`. However, in most modern SQL databases (`SQL Server`, `PostgreSQL`, etc.), the original syntax should work fine.

Also note that this assumes that `NULL` values are treated as distinct from other values when comparing using the `IS NULL` operator. This is generally the case, but it's worth verifying if you're working with an older database system or a specific use case where this behavior might be different.<end>

What SQL query would you use to find the names of all customers who have a city listed in the "Customers" table, but for whom there is no corresponding income value in the "Incomes" table? The "Customers" table has columns for "Name", "Age", and "City", while the "Incomes" table has columns for "City", "State", and "Income".<start>To solve this problem, we would use a SQL query that selects names of customers from the "Customers" table where there is no matching income in the "Incomes" table based on city. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.City NOT IN (
    SELECT City 
    FROM Incomes
);
```

However, this approach using `NOT IN` might not be efficient or recommended for larger datasets because subqueries in the `IN` operator are not efficient. Instead, we can use a `LEFT JOIN` to solve this problem more efficiently:

```sql
SELECT c.Name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Incomes i ON c.City = i.City
WHERE i.Income IS NULL;
```

This query does essentially the same thing as the first one but uses a `LEFT JOIN` instead of a subquery with `NOT IN`. Here's how it works:

1. We start by selecting all columns (`*`) from the "Customers" table, because we want to see the customer names.
2. We use a `LEFT JOIN` with the "Incomes" table on the condition that the city in both tables matches.
3. The `LEFT JOIN` will return all customers (from the "Customers" table), and for each one, it will also include the corresponding income (if there is one) from the "Incomes" table.
4. However, since we're looking for cities without any income, we want to keep only those rows where there's no matching income in the "Incomes" table. We do this by filtering out rows with `i.Income IS NOT NULL`, meaning if there is an income (essentially, a match), then exclude it.
5. The result will be a list of customer names for whom there was no corresponding income value based on city.

This second approach using `LEFT JOIN` is generally preferred and more scalable than the first one because `JOIN`s are optimized in SQL for performance, especially compared to subqueries with `NOT IN`.<end>

What is the minimum average rating of locations in each state that have an average rating above 3? Assume we are working with two tables: 'Locations' and 'States', where 'Locations' has a list of locations along with their corresponding ratings, and 'States' contains information about different states including their location. The table 'Locations' is as follows:

| Location | State   | Rating |
| ---      | ---     | ---    |
| Portage  | Michigan| 2       |
| Peachtree Corners | Georgia | 1       |
| Mishawaka | Indiana | 5       |
| Moore    | Oklahoma| 2       |
| Lawton   | Oklahoma| 2       |
| Norwich  | Connecticut| 2       |
| Rohnert Park| California | 1       |

The 'States' table is not needed for this specific problem but can be used to fetch state names in other queries.<start>To find the minimum average rating of locations in each state that have an average rating above 3, we need to calculate the average rating for each state and then filter those states where the average rating is greater than 3.

Here's how you can do it using SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    State, 
    AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM 
    Locations
GROUP BY 
    State
HAVING 
    AVG(Rating) > 3;
```

This query groups the locations by state and calculates the average rating for each group. The HAVING clause then filters these results to only include states where the average rating is greater than 3.

Note: This will return one row per state, with the average rating in the Average_Rating column. If you want to find the minimum average rating across all qualifying states, you can use a subquery or a join:

```sql
SELECT MIN(Average_Rating) AS Min_Avg_Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        State, 
        AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating
    FROM 
        Locations
    GROUP BY 
        State
    HAVING 
        AVG(Rating) > 3
) subquery;
```

This will return the minimum average rating across all qualifying states.<end>

What is the query that would return the timestamp of each row in descending order (newest to oldest), along with the value from the 'Queries per Second' column, and a new column called 'Rank' which shows the rank of this value within its partition (i.e., for each group of rows where the 'Timestamp' is on the same day)? The 'Rank' should be 1 for the highest value within that group.

The data is in the following table:

`performance_data`
| Queries per Second | Cache Hit Ratio (%) | Connection Count | Average Latency (ms) | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4156.66 | 74.83 | 83 | 11.13 | 2023-01-21 14:58:36 |
| 164.7 | 91.85 | 301 | 46.4 | 2022-03-18 20:43:08 |
| 4978.47 | 87.16 | 385 | 64.92 | 2022-02-04 18:21:15 |
| 2704.84 | 92.38 | 333 | 31.65 | 2022-04-13 12:31:56 |
| 1382.43 | 87.07 | 315 | 59.17 | 2021-05-01 08:46:54 |
| 373.59 | 83.66 | 85 | 5.94 | 2023-05-13 05:59:25 |

The table has a 'Timestamp' column which is of date/time type and can be used to partition the data by day.<start>You can use the following SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    Timestamp, 
    `Queries per Second`, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DATE(Timestamp) ORDER BY `Queries per Second` DESC) AS Rank
FROM performance_data
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;
```

However, if you want to get the result with all columns from the original table and have a 'Rank' column only for the highest value within each day, you can use this query:

```sql
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT 
        Timestamp, 
        `Queries per Second`, 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DATE(Timestamp) ORDER BY `Queries per Second` DESC) AS Rank
    FROM performance_data
)
SELECT 
    d.Timestamp, 
    d.`Queries per Second`, 
    r.Rank
FROM ranked r
RIGHT JOIN performance_data d ON r.Timestamp = d.Timestamp AND r.Rank = 1;
```

In the first query, `ROW_NUMBER()` is used to assign a unique number to each row within its partition (i.e., for each group of rows where the 'Timestamp' is on the same day), with the highest value within that partition getting `Rank` = 1.

The second query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `ranked` to first get the ranked data. Then, it joins this data with the original table (`performance_data`) based on the timestamp and rank. This will return only the rows from the original table that have a rank of 1 within their partition.

The result will look something like this:

| Timestamp | Queries per Second | Rank |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-05-13 05:59:25 | 373.59 | 1 |
| 2022-04-13 12:31:56 | 2704.84 | 1 |
| 2022-02-04 18:21:15 | 4978.47 | 1 |
| 2023-01-21 14:58:36 | 4156.66 | 1 |
| 2021-05-01 08:46:54 | 1382.43 | 1 |
| 2022-03-18 20:43:08 | 164.7 | 1 |

Note that the result has all columns from the original table, but only includes rows where the 'Queries per Second' value is the highest within its partition (i.e., where the rank is 1).<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires SELECT with LAG:

What is the average rating of each book in the catalog, including a column that shows whether this rating is higher than the previous one in the sequence? The data is stored in a table called "books" with the following structure:

| Title | Author | Genre | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Crystal Key | Thorne Ironwood | Science Fiction | 2.0 |
| The Silent Grove | Draven Blackthorn | Non-Fiction | 4.3 |
| A Journey Through Time | Kara Firebrand | Thriller | 1.0 |

The desired output should have the following columns: "Title", "Rating", and "Higher Than Previous".<start>**Solution**

You can achieve this using a SQL query with the `LAG` function to compare each rating with the previous one in the sequence. Here's the code:

```sql
SELECT 
  Title,
  Rating,
  CASE
    WHEN Rating > LAG(Rating) OVER (ORDER BY Rating DESC) THEN 'Yes'
    ELSE 'No'
  END AS HigherThanPrevious
FROM books;
```

**Explanation**

* We use `LAG` to access the previous rating in the sequence. The `OVER (ORDER BY Rating DESC)` clause specifies that we want to compare each rating with the one immediately above it in descending order of ratings.
* In the `CASE` statement, we check if the current rating is higher than the previous one. If true, we return 'Yes', otherwise we return 'No'.
* The output will have three columns: "Title", "Rating", and "HigherThanPrevious".

**Note**

The above code assumes that the ratings are compared in descending order because there's no guarantee that the ratings will be in ascending or any specific order. If you want to compare them in ascending order, simply remove `DESC` from the `ORDER BY` clause.

Also note that if there is only one book (or rating) in the catalog, then for this book, there won't be a "Higher Than Previous" value because there's no previous value to compare with. In such cases, you might want to add an additional condition or handling based on your specific requirements.<end>

What SQL query would return a list of restaurants along with their corresponding price range and the price range of the next restaurant in alphabetical order by Restaurant Name, including a note indicating if it's the last restaurant in the list? 

The table name is Restaurants and the relevant columns are:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Restaurant_Name | Varchar(255) | Name of the restaurant |
| Cuisine | Varchar(50) | Cuisine type of the restaurant |
| Price_Range | Char(5) | Price range of the restaurant ($, $$$, etc.) |

Note: The Restaurants table has 6 rows.<start>Here is the SQL query that will return a list of restaurants along with their corresponding price range and the price range of the next restaurant in alphabetical order by Restaurant Name:

```sql
SELECT 
    R1.Restaurant_Name,
    R1.Cuisine,
    R1.Price_Range AS Current_Price_Range,
    (SELECT Price_Range FROM Restaurants R2 WHERE R2.Restaurant_Name = R1.Restaurant_Name + 'A' ORDER BY Restaurant_Name LIMIT 1) AS Next_Price_Range,
    CASE
        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Restaurants R3 WHERE R3.Restaurant_Name > R1.Restaurant_Name AND R3.Restaurant_Name <= R1.Restaurant_Name + 'A') = 0 THEN 'Last restaurant in the list'
        ELSE ''
    END AS Note
FROM 
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT Restaurant_Name, Cuisine, Price_Range,
            (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Restaurants R2 WHERE R2.Restaurant_Name > R1.Restaurant_Name) AS RowNumber
        FROM 
            Restaurants
        ORDER BY 
            Restaurant_Name ASC
    ) R1;
```

This query first calculates the row number of each restaurant in alphabetical order. It then joins this table with itself to get the price range of the next restaurant for each current restaurant, by adding a character ('A' is used here) to the name of the current restaurant and ordering by restaurant name again. The note column checks if there are any restaurants left after the current one to add to it.<end>

What is a SQL query that will list all companies in descending order by Market Cap within their respective sectors for each quarter, and if there are multiple companies with the same highest market cap within a sector for a given quarter, list them together? 

Table: Companies 
Columns: Sector (varchar), Market_Cap (varchar), Quarter (varchar)

Note that this is a sample table with some example data. The actual query should work regardless of any additional columns or rows in the table.

| Sector | Market Cap | Quarter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy | Mega Cap | Q2 |
| Aerospace | Mega Cap | Q4 |
| Technology | Small Cap | Q2 |
| Finance | Small Cap | Q1 |
| Technology | Mega Cap | Q4 |
| Automotive | Mega Cap | Q4 |
| Biotech | Small Cap | Q1 |<start>Here's a SQL query that will achieve the desired output:

```sql
SELECT 
  Sector,
  Quarter,
  Market_Cap AS "Market Cap (descending order within sector)"
FROM (
  SELECT 
    Sector,
    Quarter,
    Market_Cap,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Sector, Quarter ORDER BY CAST(REPLACE(Market_Cap, ' Mega', '') AS DECIMAL(10,2)) DESC) AS Rank
  FROM Companies
) t
GROUP BY Sector, Quarter, Market_Cap, Rank
ORDER BY Sector, Quarter, CAST(REPLACE(Market_Cap, ' Mega', '') AS DECIMAL(10,2)) DESC;
```

This query uses a subquery to assign a rank within each sector and quarter based on the market cap in descending order. The outer query then groups by these columns and the rank, effectively listing all companies with the same highest market cap together.

Here's how it works:

1. The inner query assigns a rank using `DENSE_RANK()` function, which gives a ranking to each row within a partition (in this case, sector and quarter) based on some criteria. If two or more rows have the same rank, they will be assigned the next consecutive integer.

2. Since we want companies with the same highest market cap together, we use `REPLACE(Market_Cap, ' Mega', '')` to remove the word "Mega" from the market cap values (e.g., "Mega Cap") and then cast them as decimal(10, 2). This way, all market caps are treated as numbers for sorting purposes.

3. The outer query groups by sector, quarter, market cap, and rank. This will group all companies with the same highest market cap together within each sector and quarter.

4. Finally, we order the results by sector, quarter, and casted market cap in descending order to get the desired output.

When you run this query on your Companies table, it should list all companies in descending order by Market Cap within their respective sectors for each quarter, with companies having the same highest market cap listed together.<end>

What SQL query would return a list of genres for movies released in each year since 1970, along with the total box office earnings for those genres? The data is stored in a table called "Movies" with the following structure:

| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year | Box Office Earnings (M) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Escape from Earth | Aria Ravenwood | Adventure | 2016 | 676.51 |
| Escape from Earth | Rylan Frostblade | Drama | 1977 | 195.12 |
| Beyond the Veil | Rylan Frostblade | Adventure | 2015 | 449.37 |

The table has no foreign keys or indexes, and only contains data for movies released in the years 1970 to 2022.<start>Here is a SQL query that will return a list of genres for movies released in each year since 1970, along with the total box office earnings for those genres:
```sql
SELECT 
    Release_Year,
    Genre,
    SUM(Box_Office_Earnings) AS Total_Box_Office_Earnings
FROM 
    Movies
WHERE 
    Release_Year >= 1970
GROUP BY 
    Release_Year, 
    Genre;
```
Let me explain how this query works:

1. We select the `Release_Year`, `Genre`, and `Box_Office_Earnings` columns from the `Movies` table.
2. We apply a filter to only include movies released in years 1970 or later using the `WHERE` clause.
3. We use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by both `Release_Year` and `Genre`. This will give us one row per combination of year and genre.
4. For each group, we calculate the total box office earnings for that genre in that year using the `SUM` aggregation function.

This query will return a list of genres for movies released in each year since 1970, along with the total box office earnings for those genres.

Note: If you want to sort the results by release year and/or genre, you can add an `ORDER BY` clause at the end of the query. For example:
```sql
SELECT 
    ...
FROM 
    ...
GROUP BY 
    ...
ORDER BY 
    Release_Year,
    Genre;
```
This will order the results by release year first, and then by genre within each year.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires DROP TABLE:

I have two tables: "Stocks" and "Historical_Prices". The "Stocks" table stores information about various companies, including their name and industry, while the "Historical_Prices" table stores historical price data for these stocks. However, I need to perform an analysis on just one of the companies, but I want to remove all data from both tables that corresponds to this company.

The "Stocks" table has the following columns:

| Company | Industry |
| --- | --- |
| MediaGroup | Media |
| FoodChain | Retail |
| AutoMotive | Auto |
| BioLife | Healthcare |
| AeroSystems | Aerospace |
| RetailWorld | Retail |
| HealthGen | Healthcare |
| FinanceTrust | Finance |
| MediaGroup | Media |

The "Historical_Prices" table has the following columns:

| Company | Date | Open Price | Close Price | High Price | Low Price | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MediaGroup | 2020-02-13 | 285.32 | 986.55 | 986.55 | 285.32 | 7494459 |

| MediaGroup | 2015-01-04 | 1418.45 | 259.91 | 1418.45 | 259.91 | 4397884 |

I want to drop all rows from the "Stocks" and "Historical_Prices" tables where the company name is either "MediaGroup". How can I do this using SQL?<start>You can achieve this by running two separate `DELETE` statements, one for each table. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
-- Drop all rows from the 'Stocks' table where Company = 'MediaGroup'
DELETE FROM Stocks WHERE Company = 'MediaGroup';

-- Drop all rows from the 'Historical_Prices' table where Company = 'MediaGroup'
DELETE FROM Historical_Prices WHERE Company = 'MediaGroup';
```

However, since you mentioned `DROP TABLE`, I assume you're looking for a way to completely remove both tables and then recreate them. This approach is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

If you still want to drop the tables, make sure to back up your data first! Then, you can run:

```sql
-- Drop the 'Stocks' table
DROP TABLE Stocks;

-- Drop the 'Historical_Prices' table
DROP TABLE Historical_Prices;
```

After dropping the tables, if needed, recreate them with their respective structures. Be cautious when dropping and recreating tables, as it might lead to data loss.

Keep in mind that using `DROP` is generally not recommended for daily operations or production environments. Instead, use `DELETE` statements to remove specific rows without affecting the table structure. If you need to drop a table, consider backing up your data first!<end>

What is a SQL query that would insert a new row into the "Flights" table with the following information: End Location = New York, Duration (hours) = 25.3, and Fuel Used (gallons) = 48.1? The table definition for Flights is:

| End Location | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Miami | 20.9 | 22.5 |
| San Francisco | 18.9 | 11.9 |
| Phoenix | 20.9 | 67.8 |
| Los Angeles | 24.2 | 35.6 |

The Flights table has a primary key of "id" which is an auto-incrementing integer, but I only know the id value for one existing row (id = 1).<start>To insert a new row into the `Flights` table with the specified information, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
INSERT INTO Flights (End Location, Duration (hours), Fuel Used (gallons))
VALUES ('New York', 25.3, 48.1);
```

However, since there are spaces in column names, it's more common and safer to enclose them with backticks for SQL queries:

```sql
INSERT INTO Flights (`End Location`, `Duration (hours)`, `Fuel Used (gallons)`)
VALUES ('New York', 25.3, 48.1);
```

Or, if you prefer double quotes which are also valid in some SQL dialects:

```sql
INSERT INTO Flights ("End Location", "Duration (hours)", "Fuel Used (gallons)")
VALUES ('New York', 25.3, 48.1);
```

Each of these queries will insert a new row into the `Flights` table with the specified values for `End Location`, `Duration (hours)`, and `Fuel Used (gallons)`.

Note that since you mentioned an existing row has `id = 1`, if there's any dependency on this column, it might be relevant in your actual database, especially if `id` is a foreign key or part of a unique constraint with other columns. However, for the purpose of inserting new data into the table as described, the provided SQL query should suffice.<end>

What is a SQL query that deletes all rows from the "Trips" table where the duration of the trip is more than 60 hours? The Trips table has the following structure:

| Trip Name | End Location | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| City Explorer | New York | 48.1 | 17.2 |
| Historic Route | San Francisco | 47.9 | 10.9 |
| Lakeside Retreat | Houston | 55.7 | 43.3 |
| Desert Drive | Phoenix | 18.9 | 45.2 |
| Valley Voyage | Los Angeles | 50.5 | 45.6 |
| Desert Drive | Houston | 47.0 | 57.3 |
| City Explorer | Houston | 51.8 | 44.5 |
| Historic Route | San Francisco | 44.9 | 43.3 |
| Valley Voyage | Denver | 9.3 | 14.9 |

Note that this table has only one row where the duration of the trip is more than 60 hours, which is "Lakeside Retreat" with a duration of 55.7 hours.<start>Here is a SQL query that deletes all rows from the "Trips" table where the duration of the trip is more than 60 hours:

```sql
DELETE FROM Trips
WHERE Duration (hours) > 60;
```

However, please note that executing this query will delete one row ("Lakeside Retreat") with a duration of 55.7 hours from your "Trips" table.

If you want to confirm the deletion before proceeding, consider running a `SELECT` query first:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Trips
WHERE Duration (hours) > 60;
```

This will return only the row ("Lakeside Retreat") that matches the condition, allowing you to review it before performing the actual deletion.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires UPDATE:

What SQL statement would you use to update the 'Price' column of all products in the 'Toys' category with a discount of 10% off their current price?

Table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
  Product_Name VARCHAR(255),
  SKU VARCHAR(20),
  Price DECIMAL(10,2),
  Stock_Quantity INT,
  Category VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Sample data:
```sql
INSERT INTO Products (Product_Name, SKU, Price, Stock_Quantity, Category) 
VALUES 
('Gizmo', 'SKU-1009', 456.67, 219, 'Toys'),
('Doohickey', 'SKU-1092', 105.04, 257, 'Household'),
('Thingamajig', 'SKU-1030', 191.32, 451, 'Household'),
('Doohickey', 'SKU-1095', 369.11, 272, 'Automotive'),
('Gadget', 'SKU-1044', 410.55, 114, 'Toys'),
('Gizmo', 'SKU-1012', 471.28, 422, 'Electronics'),
('Gadget', 'SKU-1069', 462.86, 179, 'Toys'),
('Contraption', 'SKU-1074', 298.3, 331, 'Toys'),
('Device', 'SKU-1086', 133.78, 127, 'Toys'),
('Contraption', 'SKU-1012', 39.67, 294, 'Automotive');
```<start>**Updating Product Prices with a Discount**

To update the `Price` column of all products in the `'Toys'` category with a discount of 10% off their current price, we can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
UPDATE Products
SET Price = (Price * 0.9)
WHERE Category = 'Toys';
```

**Explanation:**

* `UPDATE Products`: This clause specifies the table (`Products`) that we want to update.
* `SET Price = (Price * 0.9)`: We're updating the `Price` column by multiplying it with a factor of 0.9, which is equivalent to reducing it by 10%.
* `WHERE Category = 'Toys'`: This clause filters the products in the `'Toys'` category, so only those products will be updated.

**Example Use Case:**

After executing this SQL statement, all products in the `'Toys'` category will have their prices discounted by 10%. For instance, the price of `Gizmo` (SKU-1009) will change from $456.67 to $412.00 (456.67 \* 0.9 = 411.80).

Note that this statement only updates the `Price` column and does not modify any other columns or data in the table.<end>

What is a SQL query that will create a table called "Restaurant_Info" with columns for restaurant name, cuisine, location, rating, and price range, but ensure that there are no duplicate entries in the table when inserting multiple reviews for restaurants that already exist? 

The desired output would be to insert all given data into the table, but if the same restaurant is inserted again (with different information), only the most recent review information should remain.<start>**SQL Query: Create Table and Prevent Duplicate Entries**

Here's a SQL query that creates the `Restaurant_Info` table with the specified columns and ensures no duplicate entries are inserted:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Restaurant_Info (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  cuisine VARCHAR(100),
  location VARCHAR(200),
  rating DECIMAL(2,1),
  price_range VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create an index to enforce uniqueness of restaurant names
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_restaurant_name ON Restaurant_Info (name);
```
However, the above query doesn't prevent duplicate entries in case you want to insert multiple reviews for a single restaurant. To achieve that, we'll need to modify the insertion query.

**SQL Query: Insert Data with No Duplicates**

Here's an example of how to insert data into the `Restaurant_Info` table while preventing duplicate entries:
```sql
INSERT INTO Restaurant_Info (id, name, cuisine, location, rating, price_range)
VALUES
  (1, 'Restaurant A', 'Italian', 'New York', 4.5, '$$'),
  (2, 'Restaurant B', 'Mexican', 'Los Angeles', 3.8, '$$$');

-- To insert a review for an existing restaurant, use the following query:
INSERT INTO Restaurant_Info (id, name, cuisine, location, rating, price_range)
VALUES
  (1, 'Restaurant A', 'Italian', 'New York', 4.7, '$$') -- will update the existing record

-- To prevent inserting duplicate reviews for an existing restaurant,
-- use a query that updates the existing record if it already exists:
INSERT INTO Restaurant_Info (id, name, cuisine, location, rating, price_range)
SELECT
  COALESCE(id, 1) AS id,
  name,
  cuisine,
  location,
  rating,
  price_range
FROM (
  SELECT
    MAX(id) OVER (PARTITION BY name) AS id,
    name,
    cuisine,
    location,
    rating,
    price_range
  FROM Restaurant_Info
) t;
```
**Explanation**

The `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` statement creates a unique index on the `name` column, which prevents duplicate entries in case of inserting multiple reviews for the same restaurant.

To prevent inserting duplicate reviews for an existing restaurant, we use a query that updates the existing record if it already exists. The subquery uses the `MAX` aggregation function with `OVER (PARTITION BY name)` to get the maximum `id` value for each `name`, which represents the most recent review information. This way, when inserting data into the table, we'll either insert a new record or update an existing one.

Note: The `COALESCE(id, 1)` expression in the subquery is used to ensure that if no records exist for a particular restaurant, a new record will be inserted with `id = 1`.

**Example Use Cases**

1. Inserting multiple reviews for an existing restaurant:
```sql
INSERT INTO Restaurant_Info (id, name, cuisine, location, rating, price_range)
VALUES
  (3, 'Restaurant A', 'Italian', 'New York', 4.8, '$$'),
  (4, 'Restaurant B', 'Mexican', 'Los Angeles', 3.9, '$$$');
```
Only the most recent review information for each restaurant will be retained.

2. Inserting data for a new restaurant:
```sql
INSERT INTO Restaurant_Info (id, name, cuisine, location, rating, price_range)
VALUES
  (5, 'Restaurant C', 'Chinese', 'Chicago', 4.0, '$$');
```
A new record with `id = 1` will be inserted.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires ALTER TABLE:

What SQL command would you use to add a new column called "Inventory_Qty" of data type integer to the "SKUs" table, which currently has columns for "SKU", "Price", and "Supplier_Name"? The Inventory_Qty column should be initialized with a default value of 0. The current state of the SKUs table is:

| SKU | Price | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SKU-1058 | 391.31 | Globex |
| SKU-1037 | 258.25 | Umbrella Corp |
| SKU-1016 | 428.72 | Wayne Enterprises |
| SKU-1007 | 492.92 | Wayne Enterprises |

How would you alter the table to add this new column and set its default value?<start>You can use the ALTER TABLE command with the ADD COLUMN clause to add a new column to the "SKUs" table, like so:

```sql
ALTER TABLE SKUs 
ADD Inventory_Qty INT DEFAULT 0;
```

This SQL command adds a new column called "Inventory_Qty" of data type integer to the "SKUs" table. The default value for this column is set to 0.

After executing this command, the structure of the SKUs table would be:

| SKU | Price | Supplier Name | Inventory_Qty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SKU-1058 | 391.31 | Globex | 0 |
| SKU-1037 | 258.25 | Umbrella Corp | 0 |
| SKU-1016 | 428.72 | Wayne Enterprises | 0 |
| SKU-1007 | 492.92 | Wayne Enterprises | 0 |

Note that all existing rows in the table will have a value of `NULL` for the new "Inventory_Qty" column until you populate it with data.<end>

What is the total fuel used by all trips that started and ended in California? 

Table: Trips
| Trip Name | Start Location | End Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| City Explorer | Houston | San Francisco |
| Mountain Adventure | New York | Chicago |
| City Explorer | Los Angeles | Denver |
| City Explorer | Denver | San Francisco |
| Mountain Adventure | Los Angeles | Denver |
| Mountain Adventure | Chicago | New York |

Table: Cities
| City Name | State |
| --- | --- |
| Houston | Texas |
| San Francisco | California |
| New York | New York |
| Chicago | Illinois |
| Los Angeles | California |
| Denver | Colorado<start>To find the total fuel used by all trips that started and ended in California, let's identify those trips first. 

Trips starting and ending in California are: 
1) City Explorer (Los Angeles to Denver is not a CA start and end trip)
2) City Explorer (Denver to San Francisco is a CA start and end trip)
3) Mountain Adventure (Los Angeles to Denver is a CA start and end trip)

Notice the original table did not have fuel usage, so we cannot actually calculate the total fuel used.<end>

Here's a SQL question that requires SELECT with a LEFT JOIN:

What is the average humidity reading for each type of weather condition on the days when it was not rainy? The table 'WeatherData' contains the following columns:
| Location | Condition | Humidity (%) | Day |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia | Rainy | 84 | Tuesday |
| Waco, Texas | Foggy | 79 | Monday |
| Jonesboro, Arkansas | Snowy | 73 | Wednesday |
| Fargo, North Dakota | Snowy | 38 | Thursday |
| Kansas City, Missouri | Rainy | 69 | Thursday |
| Warner Robins, Georgia | Sunny | 80 | Thursday |
| Franklin, Tennessee | Snowy | 76 | Friday |
| Gainesville, Florida | Foggy | 74 | Friday |

The table 'RainfallData' contains the following columns:
| Location | Total Rainfall (in) | Day |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia | 2.5 | Tuesday |
| Kansas City, Missouri | 1.8 | Thursday |
| Gainesville, Florida | 0.9 | Friday |

Can you write a SQL query to retrieve the average humidity reading for each type of weather condition on the days when it was not rainy?<start>Here's a SQL query that uses `LEFT JOIN` to solve the problem:

```sql
SELECT 
    WD.Condition, 
    AVG(WD.Humidity (%)) AS AverageHumidity
FROM 
    WeatherData WD
LEFT JOIN 
    RainfallData RD ON WD.Location = RD.Location AND WD.Day = RD.Day
WHERE 
    WD.Condition NOT IN ('Rainy') 
GROUP BY 
    WD.Condition;
```

Here's how it works:

*   The `LEFT JOIN` combines rows from the `WeatherData` table with the matching rows in the `RainfallData` table based on location and day. If there is no match, the result will still contain all the rows from `WeatherData`.
*   The `WHERE` clause excludes any rows where the condition was 'Rainy'.
*   Finally, we use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the remaining data by weather condition and calculate the average humidity for each group using the `AVG()` function.

Example output:

| Condition | AverageHumidity |
| --- | --- |
| Foggy     | 76.5          |
| Snowy     | 73.0          |
| Sunny     | 80.0          |

This query will return the average humidity for each type of weather condition on the days when it was not rainy, as requested.<end>

What SQL query would return all motion sensor readings from the `sensors` table that occurred on the same day as a light sensor reading from the `light_sensing_system` table in the same location? Assume the relevant columns and tables are:

**sensors**

| Device Type | Location | Reading Value | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motion Detector | Living Room | 62.01 | 2023-02-12 16:09:05 |
| Light Sensor | Living Room | -16.83 | 2021-03-26 04:11:57 |

**light_sensing_system**

| Location | Timestamp |
| --- | --- |
| Living Room | 2023-02-12 10:00:00 |
| Living Room | 2021-03-26 08:00:00 |

Note that the `Timestamp` column in both tables is of type DATE, and we want to join on this date value.<start>Here is the SQL query that will return all motion sensor readings from the `sensors` table that occurred on the same day as a light sensor reading from the `light_sensing_system` table in the same location:
```sql
SELECT s.*
FROM sensors AS s
JOIN light_sensing_system AS l ON DATE(s.Timestamp) = DATE(l.Timestamp)
AND s.Location = l.Location;
```
Let me explain how this query works:

* We're selecting all columns (`s.*`) from the `sensors` table, and we'll alias it as `s`.
* We're joining the `sensors` table with the `light_sensing_system` table on two conditions:
	+ The date part of the `Timestamp` column in both tables must match: `DATE(s.Timestamp) = DATE(l.Timestamp)`. This ensures that we're comparing dates, not times.
	+ The `Location` column must match between both tables: `s.Location = l.Location`.
* By joining on these two conditions, we'll get all rows from the `sensors` table where there is a matching row in the `light_sensing_system` table with the same date and location.

Note that if you want to return only the actual reading values (not all columns), you can modify the query as follows:
```sql
SELECT s.Reading Value AS Motion Reading, l.Timestamp AS Light Timestamp
FROM sensors AS s
JOIN light_sensing_system AS l ON DATE(s.Timestamp) = DATE(l.Timestamp)
AND s.Location = l.Location;
```
This will return a query result with two columns: `Motion Reading` and `Light Timestamp`, containing the reading value from the `sensors` table and the timestamp from the `light_sensing_system` table, respectively.<end>

What SQL query would you use to return all book titles from either a 'Books' table containing information about published books or an 'Upcoming Releases' table with details on upcoming book releases, including titles that exist in both tables and those that only appear in one of the two? 

The 'Books' table has the following structure:
- Title
- Author
- Genre
- Publication Year
- Rating

The 'Upcoming Releases' table is structured as follows:
- Title
- Author
- Genre
- Release Year
- Expected Rating

Example data for both tables would be:
 
'Books' table:
| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Forgotten World | Draven Blackthorn | Horror | 1976 | 4.0 |
| The Last Sky | Elara Moonshadow | Historical | 1990 | 3.1 |
| Tales of the Brave | Rowan Ashborne | Mystery | 1991 | 3.8 |
| The Silent Grove | Isla Windrider | Science Fiction | 2002 | 4.2 |

'Upcoming Releases' table:
| Title | Author | Genre | Release Year | Expected Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shadows of the Night | Arden Greenleaf | Horror | 2023 | 5.0 |
| Beyond the Grave | Lila Darksong | Historical | 2024 | 3.9 |
| Into the Storm | Caleb Stormsurge | Mystery | 2022 | 4.1 |
| The End of Time | Kaida Darkfire | Science Fiction | 2025 | 4.5 |

How would you write an SQL query to return all book titles from either table, including those that exist in both, using a full join?<start>Here is the SQL query that uses a FULL JOIN to return all book titles from either the 'Books' table or the 'Upcoming Releases' table:
```sql
SELECT 
  COALESCE(b.Title, ur.Title) AS Title,
  b.Author, 
  b.Genre,
  IFNULL(b.Publication_Year, ur.Release_Year) AS Release_Year,
  IFNULL(b.Rating, ur.Expected_Rating) AS Rating
FROM 
  Books b
FULL OUTER JOIN 
  Upcoming Releases ur ON b.Title = ur.Title AND b.Author = ur.Author AND b.Genre = ur.Genre;
```
This query will return all book titles from either table, including those that exist in both. The `COALESCE` function is used to select the non-NULL value between `b.Title` and `ur.Title`, while the `IFNULL` function is used to select the non-NULL value between `b.Publication_Year` or `ur.Release_Year` (and similarly for `b.Rating` and `ur.Expected_Rating`). The `FULL OUTER JOIN` clause is used to include rows from both tables, even if there are no matching records.

Note that this query assumes that the join columns (`Title`, `Author`, `Genre`) have the same data type in both tables. If they do not, you may need to use a different approach, such as casting one or more of the columns to a compatible type before joining.

Example output:
| Title | Author | Genre | Release_Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Forgotten World | Draven Blackthorn | Horror | 1976 | 4.0 |
| Shadows of the Night | Arden Greenleaf | Horror | 2023 | 5.0 |
| Tales of the Brave | Rowan Ashborne | Mystery | 1991 | 3.8 |
| Into the Storm | Caleb Stormsurge | Mystery | 2022 | 4.1 |
| The Last Sky | Elara Moonshadow | Historical | 1990 | 3.1 |
| Beyond the Grave | Lila Darksong | Historical | 2024 | 3.9 |
| The Silent Grove | Isla Windrider | Science Fiction | 2002 | 4.2 |
| The End of Time | Kaida Darkfire | Science Fiction | 2025 | 4.5 |

This query will return all book titles from either table, including those that exist in both tables and those that only appear in one or the other table.<end>

What is the SQL query to get the total market capitalization of companies in each sector that have a higher stock price than their average competitor (assuming competitors are other companies within the same sector), grouping by sector? 

The table "Stocks" contains:

| Company | Sector | Market Cap | Stock Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HealthPlus | Finance | Mid Cap | 15.28 |
| FinanceWorks | Aerospace | Large Cap | 806.0 |
| RetailHub | Automotive | Mid Cap | 364.36 |
| GlobalTrade | Biotech | Large Cap | 66.84 |
| TechCorp | Automotive | Mid Cap | 218.44 |
| HealthPlus | Aerospace | Large Cap | 482.77 |
| AutoDrive | Automotive | Small Cap | 561.83 |

Note: The data in the table is fictional and used for illustration purposes only.<start>To solve this problem, you'll need to calculate the average stock price of each company's competitors within the same sector, then compare that with the given company's stock price to identify those with a higher stock price than their average competitor. Finally, sum up the market capitalization of these companies for each sector.

Here is how you could do this in SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Sector,
    SUM(sc.Market_Cap) AS Total_Market_Cap
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Company,
        Sector,
        Market_Cap,
        Stock_Price,
        AVG(Stock_Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Sector EXCLUDE NULLS) AS Avg_Competitor_Price
    FROM Stocks
) sc
WHERE sc.Stock_Price > sc.Avg_Competitor_Price
GROUP BY s.Sector;
```

However, the above query might not work in all SQL implementations due to limitations on window functions within subqueries. Here's an alternative that should work:

```sql
WITH Competitor_Averages AS (
    SELECT 
        Company,
        Sector,
        Market_Cap,
        Stock_Price,
        AVG(Stock_Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Sector EXCLUDE NULLS) AS Avg_Competitor_Price
    FROM Stocks
)
SELECT 
    s.Sector,
    SUM(sc.Market_Cap) AS Total_Market_Cap
FROM Competitor_Averages sc
WHERE sc.Stock_Price > sc.Avg_Competitor_Price
GROUP BY s.Sector;
```

This version uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) which provides more flexibility with window functions. The logic remains the same: calculate average competitor prices, compare them to each company's price, and then sum up market capitalization of those companies that have a higher stock price than their competitors for each sector.

Note that you might need to adjust this query depending on your actual table structure (e.g., if column names differ) and SQL database system being used.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all companies in the "Retail" sector with a market cap of "Mid Cap" and an annual revenue between $200 billion and $500 billion? 

The table involved has the following columns:
- Company (text)
- Sector (text)
- Market Cap (text)
- Annual Revenue (B) (numeric)
- Quarter (text)

Example data is provided above.<start>Here is a SQL query that meets your requirements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table_name  -- replace 'your_table_name' with the actual name of your table
WHERE Sector = 'Retail'
AND Market Cap = 'Mid Cap'
AND Annual Revenue (B) BETWEEN 200 AND 500;
```

This query will return all rows from `your_table_name` that match the specified conditions: 

* The company's sector is "Retail".
* The company's market capitalization is "Mid Cap".
* The company's annual revenue falls within the range of $200 billion and $500 billion.

Note that I've used the exact column names and data types you provided, so be sure to replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table. Also, this assumes that the numeric data type for "Annual Revenue (B)" is suitable for comparing with numbers; if it's not a numeric type, you may need to convert or cast it first.<end>

What SQL query would you use to find all movies released by directors whose name starts with 'T' and who do not have an official website (i.e., the 'Website' column is NULL) in a database table named 'movies', assuming the relevant data is as follows:

| Director | Release Year | Website |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Talon Blackthorn | 1997 | www.blackthornfilms.com |
| Orin Shadowalker | 1974 | null |
| Talon Blackthorn | 1974 | null |
| Drake Nightshade | 1972 | www.nightshadefilms.net |
| Orin Shadowalker | 1980 | www.shadowalkermovies.org |
| Selene Darkwhisper | 1998 | null |

The result should only include movies from directors 'Talons Blackthorns' and possibly other directors whose names start with 'T', but also have a NULL value in the 'Website' column.<start>Here is the SQL query that would find all movies released by directors whose name starts with 'T' and who do not have an official website:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE Director LIKE 'T%' AND Website IS NULL;
```
Let me explain how this works:

* `LIKE 'T%'` matches any string that starts with the letter 'T'. The `%` wildcard character is used to match any characters after the 'T' (hence the 'T%' pattern).
* `AND Website IS NULL` filters out rows where the `Website` column has a value. Since we want only movies from directors without an official website, this condition ensures that only those rows with a NULL value in the `Website` column are included.

Running this query on your sample data would yield:

| Director | Release Year | Website |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Talon Blackthorn | 1974 | null |
| Talon Blackthorn | 1997 | www.blackthornfilms.com (not selected because of the 'T%' LIKE pattern, but I added it for context)
| Selene Darkwhisper | 1998 | null |

Note that this query would return all movies from directors whose name starts with 'T' and have a NULL value in the `Website` column. The result includes only movies from Talon Blackthorn (twice) and also from Selene Darkwhisper, since her name doesn't start with 'T'.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires SELECT with IS NOT NULL in the WHERE clause:

What is the average rating of all books written by authors who have also published non-fiction books, but only consider ratings from books where the publication year is available? 

Book information is stored in the "Books" table. The tables and columns involved are:

| Title | Author | Genre | Publication Year | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Assume that all authors who have published non-fiction books have also written other types of books.<start>Here's how you can solve this problem using SQL.

```sql
SELECT AVG(Rating)
FROM Books
WHERE Genre = 'non-fiction' AND Publication Year IS NOT NULL;
```

In this solution, we're selecting the average rating from all rows in the `Books` table where both conditions are met: 

- The genre is 'non-fiction'. 
- The publication year is not null.<end>

What is the average Box Office Earnings for movies in each Genre that have a Release Year greater than 1999 and earned more than $500 million? 

The Movie database consists of:

Movie
| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year | Box Office Earnings (M) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Great Expedition | Aria Ravenwood | Adventure | 1983 | 336.92 |
| Dreamwalker | Mara Moonshadow | Horror | 2021 | 684.91 |
| The Great Expedition | Mara Moonshadow | Horror | 2010 | 819.58 |
| Escape from Earth | Lira Silverleaf | Horror | 1980 | 407.88 |

Note: The actual table may have additional rows and columns, but the above is a representation of the data relevant to solving this problem.<start>To solve this problem, we need to filter out movies that meet two conditions:

1. Release Year greater than 1999
2. Box Office Earnings more than $500 million

We can then calculate the average box office earnings for each genre.

Here are the filtered results:


| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year | Box Office Earnings (M) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Great Expedition | Mara Moonshadow | Horror | 2010 | 819.58 |
| Dreamwalker | Mara Moonshadow | Horror | 2021 | 684.91 |

We can see that there are only two movies left, both of which belong to the Horror genre.

Since we have two movies in the Horror genre with a box office earnings greater than $500 million and release year more than 1999, the average box office earnings for this genre is:


(819.58 + 684.91) / 2 = 752.245

So, the answer is:

For the Horror genre: **$752.24 million**

Note that this calculation assumes you are looking at a specific time period (movies released after 1999), and if there were no movies in other genres that met these conditions, then the average earnings for those genres would be $0.

If we apply the same logic to the Adventure genre, we can see that:

| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year | Box Office Earnings (M) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Great Expedition | Aria Ravenwood | Adventure | 1983 | 336.92 |

There is only one movie in this genre that meets the conditions, so the average box office earnings would be:


336.92 

So, for the Adventure genre: **$336.92 million**<end>

What SQL query would you use to rank each movie by its Box Office Earnings (in millions) from highest to lowest, but also include a column that shows how many movies have earned more than or equal to this particular movie's earnings? 

Table: Movies 
| Title | Release Year | Box Office Earnings (M) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rise of the Titans | 2020 | 927.37 |
| Mystery of the Depths | 1979 | 823.52 |
| The Endless Horizon | 1988 | 431.45 |
| Guardians of the Galaxy | 2014 | 774.25 |
| Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace | 1999 | 924.76 |

In this example, we would expect a result set that looks like:

| Title | Release Year | Box Office Earnings (M) | Rank | More Than Earning Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace | 1999 | 924.76 | 1 | 2 |
| Rise of the Titans | 2020 | 927.37 | 1 | 2 |
| Mystery of the Depths | 1979 | 823.52 | 3 | 1 |
| Guardians of the Galaxy | 2014 | 774.25 | 4 | 0 |
| The Endless Horizon | 1988 | 431.45 | 5 | 0 |<start>Here is the SQL query that would produce the desired result set:
```sql
SELECT 
  Title,
  Release_Year,
  Box_Office_Earnings_M,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Box_Office_Earnings_M DESC) AS Rank,
  COUNT(*) OVER (ORDER BY Box_Office_Earnings_M DESC ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) - 1 AS MoreThanEarningCount
FROM 
  Movies;
```
Let me explain how this query works:

1. The `DENSE_RANK()` window function is used to assign a rank to each movie based on its Box Office Earnings (in millions), in descending order.
2. The `COUNT(*)` window function with the `ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` clause is used to count the number of movies that have earned more than or equal to the current movie's earnings, up to but not including the current row.
3. By subtracting 1 from this count, we get the correct count of movies that have earned more than or equal to the current movie's earnings.

Note: The `DENSE_RANK()` function is used instead of `RANK()` because we want to assign the same rank to movies with identical Box Office Earnings (in millions). If we used `RANK()`, these movies would receive different ranks.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with LAG:

What is the average price range of each city in the United States where the current city's price range is higher than the previous city's price range? 

Assuming we have a table called `CityPrices` with the following structure and data:
```sql
CREATE TABLE CityPrices (
  Location VARCHAR(255),
  PriceRange VARCHAR(10)
);

INSERT INTO CityPrices (Location, PriceRange) 
VALUES ('Palm Springs, California', '$$'),
       ('Concord, North Carolina', '$$$$$'),
       ('Greenville, South Carolina', '$$$$'),
       ('Bellevue, Nebraska', '$$$$'),
       ('Overland Park, Kansas', '$$$$$'),
       ('Meridian, Idaho', '$$$$'),
       ('La Mesa, California', '$$$$'),
       ('Haltom City, Texas', '$$'),
       ('Grand Rapids, Michigan', '$$$');
```
How can we use the LAG function in a SELECT statement to achieve this?<start>Here's how you can use the `LAG` function with `SELECT` to solve this problem:

```sql
SELECT 
    Location,
    AVG(CAST(REPLACE(PriceRange, '$', '') AS INT)) as Average_Price_Range
FROM (
  SELECT *, LAG(PriceRange) OVER (ORDER BY CAST(REPLACE(PriceRange, '$', '') AS INT) DESC) PREV_PRICE_RANGE
  FROM CityPrices
) subquery
WHERE PriceRange > PREV_PRICE_RANGE
GROUP BY Location;
```

In this query:

- The subquery uses `LAG` to get the price range of the previous city and assigns it the alias `PREV_PRICE_RANGE`.
- Then, we filter the results to only include cities where the current city's price range is higher than the previous city's price range.
- Finally, we group by location (city) and calculate the average price range for each city. The `AVG` function uses a cast to convert the string price ranges into integers, so they can be compared and averaged correctly.

This will return the cities in the United States where the current city's price range is higher than the previous city's price range along with their average price ranges.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires SELECT with LEAD:

What SQL query would you use to calculate the average fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) for each unique trip name, considering only trips where the distance is greater than 1000 miles and including a "next" column that shows the next available trip name, or 'None' if it's the last row? 

Example data can be found in the following table:

| Trip Name | End Location | Distance (miles) | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coast to Coast | Chicago | 1985.3 | 62.4 | 89.6 |
| Valley Voyage | Phoenix | 1611.7 | 2.2 | 76.9 |
| Coast to Coast | Miami | 1406.0 | 5.8 | 91.5 |
| Valley Voyage | Los Angeles | 733.3 | 34.3 | 48.7 |
| City Explorer | New York | 1409.7 | 3.5 | 76.4 |
| Highway Odyssey | Denver | 1626.5 | 69.4 | 15.4 |
| Coast to Coast | New York | 1163.9 | 31.7 | 14.7 |
| Forest Journey | Miami | 2774.9 | 64.3 | 71.5 |
| City Explorer | Chicago | 903.3 | 9.4 | 13.4 |
| Highway Odyssey | New York | 290.4 | 59.4 | 91.3 |

Note that you should assume the table name is "Trips".<start>To solve this problem, you can use a SQL query with the LEAD function to bring the next trip name in for each row, and then filter out trips where the distance is less than or equal to 1000 miles. Finally, group by the unique trip names and calculate the average fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) while excluding any rows that are not part of a valid trip.

Here's how you can achieve this with SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    TripName,
    AVG(MilesPerGallon) AS AvgFuelEfficiency,
    CASE
        WHEN LEAD(TripName, 1, 'None') OVER (ORDER BY Distance DESC) = 'None'
            THEN 'None' -- If it's the last row in the ordered list of distances, indicate this by showing 'None'
        ELSE LEAD(TripName, 1, 'None') OVER (ORDER BY Distance DESC)
    END AS NextTripName
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
        TripName,
        EndLocation,
        Distance,
        Duration,
        FuelUsed,
        CASE 
            WHEN Distance > 1000 THEN Distance / FuelUsed -- Calculate fuel efficiency only for trips over 1000 miles
            ELSE NULL
        END AS MilesPerGallon
    FROM Trips
) AS subquery
WHERE MilesPerGallon IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY TripName;
```

In this SQL query, a subquery is used to first filter out rows where the distance of the trip is less than or equal to 1000 miles and calculate the fuel efficiency for those that remain. The main query then groups by the unique trip names, calculates the average fuel efficiency per group (excluding any rows where it wasn't possible), and brings in the next available trip name using the LEAD function. If it's the last row with a certain distance, 'None' is displayed as there is no "next" trip.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all stock prices for companies where the high price was above $1000 on the day when the open and close prices were closest to each other in terms of difference (i.e., |open - close| < 100), sorted by the company name, then by the absolute value of the difference between the open and close prices?<start>Here is a SQL query that should accomplish what you're looking for:
```sql
SELECT s.*
FROM stock_prices s
JOIN (
  SELECT ticker, DATE as date, MIN(DIFF(open, close)) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker) as min_diff
  FROM stock_prices
) AS subquery ON s.ticker = subquery.ticker AND s.date = subquery.date
WHERE s.high > 1000 AND s.min_diff < 100
ORDER BY s.ticker, ABS(s.min_diff)
```
This query assumes that you have a `stock_prices` table with the following columns:

* `ticker`: The stock ticker symbol (e.g. "AAPL", "GOOG")
* `date`: The date of the price data (in a format that can be compared to other dates, e.g. "2022-01-01")
* `open`, `close`, and `high`: The opening, closing, and high prices for each stock on each trading day

Here's how the query works:

1. The subquery selects the minimum absolute difference between open and close prices for each stock ticker symbol (i.e., the smallest value of |open - close|).
2. The main query joins the `stock_prices` table to this subquery, selecting only rows where:
	* The high price is greater than $1000
	* The absolute difference between open and close prices is less than 100 (i.e., |open - close| < 100)
3. The results are sorted by company name (`ticker`) and then by the absolute value of the difference between open and close prices (`ABS(s.min_diff)`).

Note: This query assumes that you want to match stock prices for each trading day where the condition is met, even if there are multiple such days for a given ticker symbol. If you only want the most recent such day, or some other specific logic for handling multiple matches, please let me know and I can modify the query accordingly!<end>

What is the average fuel used per trip duration (in hours) for trips that occurred in the year 2020, grouped by start location? Assume we have a "Trips" table with the following structure and example data:

| Trip ID | Trip Name | Start Date | End Date | Distance (miles) | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1       | Highway Odyssey   | 2020-01-01    | 2020-05-15     | 1034.9 | 49.8 | 94.3 |
| 2       | City Explorer      | 2020-06-01    | 2020-09-20     | 2261.4 | 65.2 | 10.5 |
| 3       | Valley Voyage      | 2020-10-01    | 2020-11-25     | 2285.9 | 21.2 | 73.8 |

Note: The year of the trip is represented by the "Start Date" column, which includes the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.<start>**Calculating Average Fuel Used per Trip Duration**

To calculate the average fuel used per trip duration for trips that occurred in the year 2020, grouped by start location, we will use a SQL query.

```sql
WITH 
  -- Select the relevant columns and filter the data by the specified conditions
  TripData AS (
    SELECT 
      StartLocation,
      Duration,
      FuelUsed,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY StartDate ORDER BY Duration) AS RowNum
    FROM 
      Trips
    WHERE 
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM StartDate) = 2020
  ),
  
  -- Calculate the average fuel used per trip duration for each start location
  AverageFuel AS (
    SELECT 
      StartLocation,
      AVG(FuelUsed / Duration) AS AvgFuelPerDuration
    FROM 
      TripData
    WHERE 
      RowNum = 1 -- Consider only the first row for each start date and ordered duration
    GROUP BY 
      StartLocation
  )

SELECT * FROM AverageFuel;
```

**How it works**

This query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

- **TripData CTE**: This selects the relevant columns from the `Trips` table, filters the data by trips in the year 2020, and assigns a row number for each start date ordered by duration.
  
- **AverageFuel CTE**: This calculates the average fuel used per trip duration for each start location. It considers only the first row for each start date and ordered duration.

Finally, it selects all columns from the `AverageFuel` CTE to display the results.

**Assumptions**

The query assumes that there is a single start location associated with each trip in the data (since it groups by `StartLocation`). If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the query accordingly. 

Also note that if multiple trips have the same duration for the same start location and year, they will be averaged together.<end>

What is the SQL command to drop the "Customers" table in a database that contains the following information:

Table: Customers
Columns: Name, City, State

Data:
| Name | City | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Henrietta | Bowling Green | Wisconsin |
| Verna | Kannapolis | Tennessee |
| Jody | New Rochelle | Illinois |
| Jude | Lodi | Georgia |

However, the "Customers" table has a constraint that references another table called "Orders", which means it cannot be dropped until the referencing constraint is also deleted. What SQL command should be used to drop this constraint and then subsequently drop the "Customers" table?<start>```python
def drop_table_and_constraint(conn, table_name):
    """
    Drops a table in a database along with any referencing constraints.

    Args:
        conn (sqlite3.Connection): The connection to the SQLite database.
        table_name (str): The name of the table to be dropped.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # First, we need to get the names of all tables that have foreign keys referencing 'Customers'
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # We use PRAGMA foreign_key_list to get a list of tables with foreign key constraints referencing 'Customers'
    cursor.execute(f"PRAGMA foreign_key_list({table_name})")
    
    # Fetch all rows from the result
    references = cursor.fetchall()

    # If there are no referencing tables, we can simply drop 'Customers' table
    if not references:
        # Drop the table itself
        cursor.execute(f"DROP TABLE {table_name};")
        conn.commit()
        return

    # For each referencing table...
    for ref in references:
        # Get its name from the result
        ref_table = ref[0]

        cursor.execute(f"ALTER TABLE {ref_table} DROP CONSTRAINT {ref[1]};")

What SQL query can I use to insert a new record into the "Restaurants" table with columns for "Cuisine", "Rating", and an additional column named "Location" which is a string representing the physical address of the restaurant? The existing data in the table might look something like this:

| Cuisine | Rating |
| --- | --- |
| Mexican | 1 |
| Mexican | 1 |
| Japanese | 3 |
| Italian | 5 |
| Mediterranean | 2 |
| Italian | 3 |

However, I want to insert a new record with a specific cuisine and rating but also specify the location where this restaurant can be found?<start>You can use the following SQL query to insert a new record into the "Restaurants" table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Restaurants (Cuisine, Rating, Location)
VALUES ('Italian', 4, '123 Main St, Anytown USA');
```

In this example, we're specifying that the new restaurant has an Italian cuisine and a rating of 4. The `Location` column is set to `'123 Main St, Anytown USA'`. 

Note: If you don't specify the columns in the INSERT statement, MySQL will automatically fill them in in the order they were created in the table schema, but this can lead to inconsistencies if your table structure changes over time. By specifying the columns explicitly, we ensure that data is inserted into the correct fields.

If you want to insert a new record with some existing values (e.g., one of the cuisines already present) and just change the rating or location for an existing cuisine, then it's better to use an UPDATE statement like this:

```sql
UPDATE Restaurants
SET Rating = 4, Location = '123 Main St, Anytown USA'
WHERE Cuisine = 'Italian';
```

However, if you're always adding a new cuisine and sometimes updating the rating or location of an existing one, then two separate queries might be better. 

This is assuming that your database management system supports SQL, which most do, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.<end>

What is a SQL query to delete all products from the "products" table where the stock quantity is less than 50?<start>**Delete Products with Low Stock Quantity**

To delete all products from the `products` table where the stock quantity is less than 50, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
DELETE FROM products
WHERE stock_quantity < 50;
```

This query targets the `products` table and deletes any rows where the value in the `stock_quantity` column is less than 50. Be sure to run this query with caution, as it will permanently delete data from your database.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose you have a products table with the following data:

| id | name          | stock_quantity |
|----|---------------|----------------|
| 1  | Product A     | 10             |
| 2  | Product B     | 70             |
| 3  | Product C     | 20             |
| 4  | Product D     | 80             |

 Running the above query would delete rows with id = 1 and 3, as their stock_quantity is less than 50.

**Note:** This query assumes that `stock_quantity` is an integer column. If it's a floating-point or decimal column, you might need to adjust the comparison operator accordingly (e.g., `< 49.99`).<end>

What SQL query would update the 'Release Year' column in the 'movies' table to be the current year (2024) for all rows where the 'Box Office Earnings (M)' is greater than 500 million? 

Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  Title VARCHAR(255),
  Director VARCHAR(100),
  Release_Year INT,
  Box_Office_Earnings DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

Example Data:
```sql
INSERT INTO movies (Title, Director, Release_Year, Box_Office_Earnings) 
VALUES 
('Dreamwalker', 'Orin Shadowalker', 2023, 774.56),
('Dreamwalker', 'Orin Shadowalker', 1981, 714.43),
('Starbound Odyssey', 'Aria Ravenwood', 1979, 801.09),
('Dreamwalker', 'Aria Ravenwood', 1976, 185.37),
('Starbound Odyssey', 'Orin Shadowalker', 2005, 809.82),
('Rise of the Titans', 'Drake Nightshade', 1983, 497.11);
```<start>Here is the SQL query that updates the 'Release Year' column in the 'movies' table to be the current year (2024) for all rows where the 'Box Office Earnings (M)' is greater than 500 million:
```sql
UPDATE movies
SET Release_Year = 2024
WHERE Box_Office_Earnings > 500.00;
```
Here's a breakdown of how this query works:

* `UPDATE movies`: specifies that we want to update the 'movies' table.
* `SET Release_Year = 2024`: sets the value of the 'Release_Year' column for all updated rows to be 2024.
* `WHERE Box_Office_Earnings > 500.00`: filters the rows to only include those where the 'Box Office Earnings (M)' is greater than 500 million.

Note that we use the exact numeric value `500.00` in the WHERE clause, since the earnings are stored as decimal numbers with a precision of two decimal places. If you were to simply write `WHERE Box_Office_Earnings > 500`, it would not match any rows because of the decimal part.<end>

What is a SQL query that will create two tables, one for Devices and one for Readings, where the Devices table has columns for Device ID (unique identifier), Location, Battery Level (%), and Timestamp, but also includes a foreign key referencing the Device ID in the Devices table to ensure data consistency in the Readings table?<start>Here is a SQL query that creates two tables as per your requirements:

```sql
-- Create the Devices table
CREATE TABLE Devices (
    DeviceID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Location VARCHAR(255),
    BatteryLevel DECIMAL(3, 2), -- 3 digits total, 2 after the decimal point
    Timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create the Readings table with a foreign key referencing the DeviceID in the Devices table
CREATE TABLE Readings (
    ReadingID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeviceID INT NOT NULL,
    SensorReading DECIMAL(10, 5), -- for example, temperature reading
    Timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeviceID) REFERENCES Devices(DeviceID)
);
```

In this query:

- The `Devices` table has a primary key column named `DeviceID`, and columns for location, battery level, and timestamp.
- The `Readings` table has a foreign key referencing the `DeviceID` in the `Devices` table. This ensures that a reading can only be associated with an existing device, maintaining data consistency.

**Example Use Case:**

To populate these tables with example data:

```sql
INSERT INTO Devices (DeviceID, Location, BatteryLevel)
VALUES
    (1, 'Kitchen', 85),
    (2, 'Bedroom', 90);

-- Insert readings for each device
INSERT INTO Readings (ReadingID, DeviceID, SensorReading)
VALUES
    (1, 1, 23.00), -- temperature reading in the kitchen
    (2, 2, 20.50),
    (3, 1, 82.10); -- low battery warning in the kitchen

SELECT * FROM Devices;
SELECT * FROM Readings;
```

This will create two tables with example data: `Devices` and `Readings`.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem that requires ALTER TABLE:

**Problem:** How can I modify the existing `Products` table to include a new column called `Description` with a maximum length of 200 characters, without losing any existing data?

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
  ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Price DECIMAL(5,2),
  StockQuantity INT,
  Category VARCHAR(50),
  SupplierName VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Current Data:**
| ProductID | Price | StockQuantity | Category | SupplierName |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1         | 103.86 | 117          | Household | ACME Corp    |
| 2         | 17.85   | 92           | Sports     | Globex       |
| 3         | 381.05  | 15           | Electronics| ACME Corp    |
| 4         | 176.09  | 357          | Sports     | Wonka Industries|

**Goal:** Add a new column called `Description` with a maximum length of 200 characters to the existing `Products` table, without losing any existing data.

Can you help me achieve this using SQL?<start>To solve this problem, we'll use the ALTER TABLE statement with the ADD COLUMN clause. Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Add a new column called `Description` with a maximum length of 200 characters to the existing `Products` table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD Description VARCHAR(200);
```

In this query, we're using the ALTER TABLE statement to modify the existing `Products` table. The ADD COLUMN clause is used to add a new column called `Description`. We've specified that this column should be of type VARCHAR with a maximum length of 200 characters.

**Step 2:** Check if the operation was successful and verify the modified table structure.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products;
```

After running this query, you'll see the updated `Products` table structure, which includes the new `Description` column:

| ProductID | Price   | StockQuantity | Category     | SupplierName  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1         | 103.86 | 117          | Household    | ACME Corp     | (null)      |
| 2         | 17.85   | 92           | Sports       | Globex        | (null)      |
| 3         | 381.05  | 15           | Electronics  | ACME Corp     | (null)      |
| 4         | 176.09  | 357          | Sports       | Wonka Industries|(null)      |

As you can see, the new `Description` column has been successfully added to the existing `Products` table with a maximum length of 200 characters.

**Step 3:** Update the existing data by inserting a default value or a placeholder into the new `Description` column for each row.

```sql
UPDATE Products
SET Description = '(No description available)';
```

In this query, we're using the UPDATE statement to set the `Description` column for all existing rows. We've specified that if there's no description available, it should be updated with a placeholder value of `(No description available)`.

After running this query, you'll see the updated data in the `Products` table:

| ProductID | Price   | StockQuantity | Category     | SupplierName  | Description      |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1         | 103.86 | 117          | Household    | ACME Corp     | (No description available)|
| 2         | 17.85   | 92           | Sports       | Globex        | (No description available)|
| 3         | 381.05  | 15           | Electronics  | ACME Corp     | (No description available)|
| 4         | 176.09  | 357          | Sports       | Wonka Industries|(No description available)|

The new `Description` column now contains a default value or placeholder for each existing row, as desired.

That's it! You've successfully modified the existing `Products` table to include a new column called `Description` with a maximum length of 200 characters.<end>

What is the SQL query to select the Cache Hit Ratio (%) and Average Latency (ms) from the 'server_stats' table where the Queries per Second are greater than 3000? 

The server_stats table has the following structure:

| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| id | int |
| queries_per_second | float |
| cache_hit_ratio | float |
| connection_count | int |
| average_latency | float |

Example data for the server_stats table is as follows:
| id | Queries per Second | Cache Hit Ratio (%) | Connection Count | Average Latency (ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2861.29 | 76.47 | 172 | 19.88 |
| 2 | 4023.39 | 95.7 | 81 | 15.59 |
| 3 | 845.18 | 85.02 | 51 | 50.18 |<start>Here is the SQL query to select the `Cache Hit Ratio (%)` and `Average Latency (ms)` from the 'server_stats' table where the `Queries per Second` are greater than 3000:
```sql
SELECT 
  cache_hit_ratio AS Cache_Hit_Ratio,
  average_latency AS Average_Latency_ms
FROM server_stats
WHERE queries_per_second > 3000;
```
Let me explain what's happening:

* We're selecting two columns from the `server_stats` table: `cache_hit_ratio` and `average_latency`.
* We're aliasing these columns to make them easier to read, so we can refer to them as `Cache_Hit_Ratio` and `Average_Latency_ms`.
* The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where `queries_per_second` is greater than 3000.

Running this query on your example data should return:
```markdown
+----------------+---------------+
| Cache_Hit_Ratio | Average_Latency_ms |
+----------------+---------------+
|       95.7      |        15.59     |
+----------------+---------------+
```
Only one row from the `server_stats` table meets the condition, so we see that single row in the results!<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve all movies from the 'Movies' table, including their corresponding ratings from the 'Ratings' table, even if there is no matching rating? The 'Movies' table has columns for 'Genre', 'Publication Year', and a unique identifier 'Movie ID'. The 'Ratings' table has columns for 'Rating' and a foreign key referencing the 'Movie ID'.<start>**SQL Query: Retrieve Movies with Corresponding Ratings**

To achieve this, you can use a `LEFT JOIN` in SQL. This will return all movies from the 'Movies' table, along with their corresponding ratings from the 'Ratings' table if they exist. If there is no matching rating for a movie, it will still be included in the results.

```sql
SELECT 
  M.*,
  R.Rating AS Movie_Rating
FROM 
  Movies M
LEFT JOIN 
  Ratings R ON M.Movie_ID = R.Movie_ID;
```

In this query:

*   We select all columns (`M.*`) from the `Movies` table, and alias it as `M`.
*   We select the `Rating` column from the `Ratings` table, and alias it as `Movie_Rating` for clarity.
*   The `LEFT JOIN` combines rows from both tables based on the condition that the `Movie_ID` in `Movies` matches the `Movie_ID` in `Ratings`. If there's no match, the resulting row will contain NULL values for the columns of the right table (`Ratings`).

This query assumes that you want to include all movies even if they have no ratings. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures this by returning all rows from the left table (`Movies`) and matching rows from the right table (`Ratings`) when available.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose your tables are populated with the following data:

```markdown
# Movies Table

| Movie_ID | Genre     | Publication_Year |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| 1        | Action    | 2015             |
| 2        | Comedy    | 2020             |
| 3        | Drama     | 2018             |

# Ratings Table

| Rating   | Movie_ID |
|----------|----------|
| 4.5      | 1        |
| 3.9      | 2        |
```

Running the provided query will result in:

```markdown
# Resulting Query Output

| Movie_ID | Genre     | Publication_Year | Rating    |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| 1        | Action    | 2015             | 4.5       |
| 2        | Comedy    | 2020             | 3.9       |
| 3        | Drama     | 2018             | NULL      |
```

As expected, the movie with `Movie_ID` = 3 is included in the results even though it has no rating.<end>

What SQL query can be used to retrieve all companies from the 'Companies' table that have a stock price greater than $500 and match with the sector they belong to in the 'SectorDetails' table, even if there is no matching record in the 'SectorDetails' table? The 'Companies' table contains information about various companies including their stock prices, while the 'SectorDetails' table contains sector-specific details. 

The 'Companies' table has the following structure:
- | Company (string) |
- | Sector (string) |

The 'SectorDetails' table has the following structure:
- | Sector (string) |
- | Stock Price Threshold (float) |
- | Additional Details (string) |

Example data in the 'Companies' table is shown above, and example data in the 'SectorDetails' table might look like this:

| Company | Sector | Stock Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AutoDrive | Biotech | 224.26 |
| AutoDrive | Automotive | 836.25 |
| GlobalTrade | Technology | 265.33 |
| EcoEnergy | Energy | 558.99 |
| RetailHub | Finance | 98.07 |
| Foodies | Finance | 878.25 |
| EcoEnergy | Healthcare | 402.55 |
| Foodies | Technology | 170.84 |

The 'SectorDetails' table might contain the following data:

| Sector | Stock Price Threshold | Additional Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Biotech | 300.0 | Highly competitive |
| Automotive | 600.0 | Rapid growth expected |
| Energy | 200.0 | Diversified portfolio |
| Finance | 100.0 | Low volatility sector |
| Healthcare | 500.0 | High demand for services |
| Technology | 400.0 | Innovative products |<start>To retrieve all companies from the 'Companies' table that have a stock price greater than $500 and match with the sector they belong to in the 'SectorDetails' table, even if there is no matching record in the 'SectorDetails' table, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT c.Company 
FROM Companies c 
LEFT JOIN SectorDetails sd ON c.Sector = sd.Sector 
WHERE c.Stock Price > 500.0 AND (sd.Sector IS NULL OR c.Sector = sd.Sector);
```

However, it seems like you don't have the 'Stock Price' column in the 'Companies' table, and only the sector names are mentioned. Let's assume that we're using the 'SectorDetails' 'Stock Price Threshold' as a reference to check against the companies.

If that is the case, then your query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT c.Company 
FROM Companies c 
LEFT JOIN SectorDetails sd ON c.Sector = sd.Sector 
WHERE c.Stock Price > 500.0 AND (sd.Sector IS NULL OR c.Sector = sd.Sector);
```

Or, to make it more clear and assuming that 'Stock Price' is not in the 'Companies' table but rather you want to check against the threshold value from 'SectorDetails':

```sql
SELECT c.Company 
FROM Companies c 
LEFT JOIN SectorDetails sd ON c.Sector = sd.Sector AND c.Stock Price > 500.0 
WHERE (sd.Sector IS NULL OR c.Sector = sd.Sector);
```

However, it seems more intuitive to me to filter the companies first and then apply this condition:

```sql
SELECT Company 
FROM Companies 
WHERE Stock Price > 500.0 
INTERSECT 
SELECT c.Company 
FROM Companies c 
JOIN SectorDetails sd ON c.Sector = sd.Sector;
```

And if you want to include all companies even when there is no matching record in the 'SectorDetails' table:

```sql
SELECT Company 
FROM Companies 
WHERE Stock Price > 500.0 
UNION 
SELECT c.Company 
FROM Companies c 
JOIN SectorDetails sd ON c.Sector = sd.Sector;
```

But keep in mind that these last queries require SQL Server or PostgreSQL which support INTERSECT and UNION operations respectively.

And don't forget to replace the actual column name for 'Stock Price' if it's different from what I used. Also, make sure to adjust table and column names according to your database schema.<end>

What SQL query would you use to select the trip name and end location for all trips that have a duration greater than 40 hours and also include the distance of each trip in the result set? The data is stored in a table called "trips" with columns for Trip Name, End Location, Distance (miles), and Duration (hours). 

| Trip Name | End Location | Distance (miles) | Duration (hours) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forest Journey | Phoenix | 1958.6 | 44.8 |
| Mountain Adventure | San Francisco | 2385.5 | 11.4 |
| Canyon Trek | Chicago | 1304.9 | 16.0 |
| Canyon Trek | Phoenix | 2490.7 | 52.6 |
| Mountain Adventure | Chicago | 842.4 | 45.4 |
| Mountain Adventure | San Francisco | 2490.7 | 23.0 |
| Coast to Coast | San Francisco | 171.0 | 67.4 |
| Lakeside Retreat | Houston | 1951.6 | 70.2 |
| City Explorer | New York | 1958.6 | 63.6 |

The query should use an INNER JOIN to also include the "duration_threshold" table, which has a column for Trip Name and Duration Threshold (hours). The duration threshold is set at 40 hours.

| Trip Name | Duration Threshold (hours) |
| --- | --- |
| Forest Journey | 30 |
| Mountain Adventure | 50 |
| Canyon Trek | 60 |
| Coast to Coast | 35 |
| Lakeside Retreat | 65 |
| City Explorer | 45 |<start>Here is the SQL query that would select the trip name, end location, and distance for all trips with a duration greater than 40 hours:
```sql
SELECT 
  t.Trip_Name,
  t.End_Location,
  t.Distance_miles,
  t.Duration_hours
FROM 
  trips t
INNER JOIN 
  duration_threshold d ON t.Trip_Name = d.Trip_Name
WHERE 
  t.Duration_hours > d.Duration_Threshold_hours;
```
However, since we only need to select trips where the duration is greater than 40 hours (which is not a value present in our "duration_threshold" table), we can simplify this query by using the `d.Duration_Threshold_hours` column only for filtering:
```sql
SELECT 
  t.Trip_Name,
  t.End_Location,
  t.Distance_miles,
  t.Duration_hours
FROM 
  trips t
WHERE 
  t.Duration_hours > 40;
```
The first query will include any matching rows from the "duration_threshold" table, which are not actually needed in this case. The second query is a more straightforward way to achieve the same result.

Note: If there were other tables that we wanted to join with the "trips" table for additional filtering or calculations, we would use an INNER JOIN and include those tables in the `FROM` clause. In this simplified example, however, the second query achieves our goal without needing to join any other tables.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all companies with their highest and lowest open and close prices for a given date range (e.g., '2022-01-01' to '2022-01-31'), including companies that did not trade on certain days within the date range, even if they do not have any matching records in the price history table?

**Tables:**

* **companies**: A table containing information about publicly traded companies.
	+ | id (PK) | name |
	+ | --- | --- |
	+ | 1 | AutoMotive |
	+ | 2 | MediaGroup |
	+ ... |
* **price_history**: A table containing historical open and close prices for each company.
	+ | id (PK) | company_id (FK) | date | open_price | close_price | volume |
	+ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
	+ | 1 | 1 | '2022-01-01' | 1211.92 | 1197.68 | 5100107 |
	+ | 2 | 1 | '2022-01-02' | 1200.00 | 1185.00 | 4000000 |
	+ | 3 | 2 | '2022-01-03' | 209.54 | 122.37 | 6032594 |
	+ ... |

**Expected result:**

A table with all companies, including those without price history for certain days within the date range, and their highest and lowest open and close prices for each day in the date range.

For example:

| company_name | highest_open_price | lowest_close_price | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | ... |
| AutoMotive | 1211.92 | 1197.68 | ... |
| MediaGroup | 209.54 | 122.37 | ... |
| Company XYZ | NULL | NULL | ... |

Note that 'Company XYZ' has no price history within the given date range, so its highest and lowest open and close prices are NULL.<start>Here is a SQL query that should return the expected result:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.name AS company_name,
  MAX(CASE WHEN ph.date = '2022-01-01' THEN ph.open_price END) AS highest_open_price_01,
  MIN(CASE WHEN ph.date = '2022-01-01' THEN ph.close_price END) AS lowest_close_price_01,

  MAX(CASE WHEN ph.date = '2022-01-02' THEN ph.open_price END) AS highest_open_price_02,
  MIN(CASE WHEN ph.date = '2022-01-02' THEN ph.close_price END) AS lowest_close_price_02,

  -- repeat this pattern for each day in the date range

  MAX(CASE WHEN ph.date LIKE '%2022-01-%' THEN ph.open_price END) AS highest_open_price,
  MIN(CASE WHEN ph.date LIKE '%2022-01-%' THEN ph.close_price END) AS lowest_close_price
FROM 
  companies c
  LEFT JOIN price_history ph ON c.id = ph.company_id AND ph.date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-01-31'
GROUP BY 
  c.name;
```
This query uses the `LEFT JOIN` clause to include all companies, even if they do not have any matching records in the `price_history` table. The `CASE WHEN` expressions are used to calculate the highest and lowest open and close prices for each day in the date range.

The `MAX(CASE WHEN ... END)` expression returns the maximum value of the specified column (`open_price` or `close_price`) only when the condition is true (i.e., when there is a match between the company and the date). If there is no match, the expression returns `NULL`.

Note that this query assumes that you want to consider all days in the month of January 2022. If you need to specify a different date range, simply modify the `BETWEEN` clause accordingly.

Example output:
```markdown
| company_name | highest_open_price_01 | lowest_close_price_01 | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | ... |
| AutoMotive | 1211.92 | 1197.68 | ... |
| MediaGroup | 209.54 | 122.37 | ... |
| Company XYZ | NULL | NULL | ... |
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.<end>

What SQL query would you use to find all trips that have a total distance greater than 2000 miles and a matching trip (same start and end locations) in the same direction exists with a fuel used that is within 10% of each other? The table containing the data is named `Trips` and includes columns for `Trip Name`, `Start Location`, `End Location`, `Distance (miles)`, `Duration (hours)`, and `Fuel Used (gallons)`?

| Trip Name | Start Location | End Location | Distance (miles) | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forest Journey | San Francisco | Phoenix | 2467.2 | 33.2 | 17.0 |
| Highway Odyssey | Denver | New York | 120.2 | 41.4 | 92.8 |
| Highway Odyssey | Phoenix | Denver | 1980.7 | 38.1 | 36.1 |
| Lakeside Retreat | Phoenix | San Francisco | 285.0 | 38.1 | 61.8 |
| Canyon Trek | Denver | Phoenix | 1936.5 | 62.6 | 31.3 |

Assuming that each trip is identified by a unique `Trip Name` and the direction of travel does not matter for this query, provide a SELECT statement with self-join to solve this problem.<start>Here's the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT T1.Trip Name AS Trip_Name_1,
       T1.Start Location AS Start_Location_1,
       T1.End Location AS End_Location_1,
       T2.Trip Name AS Trip_Name_2,
       T2.Start Location AS Start_Location_2,
       T2.End Location AS End_Location_2
FROM Trips T1
JOIN Trips T2 ON (T1.Start Location = T2.End Location AND T1.End Location = T2.Start Location)
WHERE T1.Trip Name != T2.Trip Name
AND T1.Distance (miles) > 2000
AND ABS(T1.Fuel Used (gallons) - T2.Fuel Used (gallons)) / 
    ((SELECT MAX(Fuel Used (gallons)) FROM Trips) * 0.1) <= 1;
```

In this query, the `JOIN` clause is used to find matching trips in both directions with the same start and end locations. The `WHERE` clause filters out trip names that are identical, distances that are less than or equal to 2000 miles, and absolute differences between fuel usage that exceed 10% of the maximum fuel usage.

Please note that you may need to adjust column aliases if they contain special characters (e.g., spaces) in your actual database schema.<end>

What SQL query would return all rows where the Battery Level is less than 50% and also contain the string 'low' in the Reading Value column? The data is stored in a table named DeviceReadings with columns Battery Level (%) and Reading Value. 

| Battery Level (%) | Reading Value |
| --- | --- |
| 28.0 | Low reading, 33.1 |
| 13.1 | Normal reading, 62.54 low battery signal present |
| 11.5 | Readings indicating low battery power, -34.87 |

Note: The table only contains two columns for this specific problem to be solvable with SQL using the correct column name.<start>Here is the SQL query that would return all rows where the Battery Level is less than 50% and also contain the string 'low' in the Reading Value column:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM DeviceReadings
WHERE Battery_Level (%) < 50 AND Reading_Value LIKE '%low%';
```
Note:

* The `LIKE` operator is used to match a pattern in the `Reading_Value` column. The `%` wildcard character matches any sequence of characters.
* If you're using a database system that doesn't support percentage signs as column aliases (e.g., MySQL), you may need to use backticks or square brackets to escape them, e.g.: `Battery_Level (%)`.

Assuming the table structure and data are as described in your example, this query would return:
```markdown
| Battery Level (%) | Reading Value |
| --- | --- |
| 28.0 | Low reading, 33.1 |
| 13.1 | Normal reading, 62.54 low battery signal present |
| 11.5 | Readings indicating low battery power, -34.87 |
```<end>

What is a SQL query that returns all book titles where there is no rating for that title in our database? The table "books" has columns Title (the name of the book), Author (the author of the book), Publication Year (the year the book was published), and Rating (the average user rating for the book).<start>**SQL Query: Books with No Rating**
=====================================

To retrieve all book titles where there is no rating, you can use a simple `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause. Since the `Rating` column represents an average user rating, we can consider any value less than or equal to 0 as indicating no rating.

```sql
SELECT Title
FROM books
WHERE Rating <= 0;
```

This query will return all book titles where there is no rating (i.e., the average user rating is either not available or has been removed).

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

Suppose your `books` table contains the following data:

| Title | Author    | Publication Year | Rating |
| ---  | ---      | ---              | ---   |
| Book1 | John Doe  | 2020             | 4.5   |
| Book2 | Jane Smith | 2019             | 0     |

The above SQL query would return:

| Title    |
| ---      |
| Book2    |

Since `Book1` has a rating, but `Book2` does not (with a value of 0 indicating no rating).<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve all rows from the "Device Readings" table where the "Reading Value" column is NOT NULL and the "Battery Level (%)" is greater than or equal to 50? Assume the data is stored in a single table called "readings" with the following columns: Device ID, Device Type, Location, Battery Level (%), Reading Value, Timestamp.<start>To retrieve all rows from the "Device Readings" table (stored in a table named "readings") that meet your conditions, you would use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM readings
WHERE ReadingValue IS NOT NULL
AND BatteryLevel >= 50;
```

This query does the following:

1. `SELECT *`: This selects all columns (`*`) from the table.
2. `FROM readings`: This specifies that we're working with a table named "readings".
3. `WHERE`: This clause filters the results based on conditions.
4. `ReadingValue IS NOT NULL` and `BatteryLevel >= 50`: These are two conditions combined by `AND`. The query will only return rows where both conditions are met.

Note: 

- `IS NOT NULL` checks if a value is not null, which is equivalent to checking for a non-null (or "not-empty") string. If you were comparing against an empty string (`''`), you would use `<> ''`, but since we're looking at numeric values (assuming "Reading Value" column and also the percentages in "Battery Level (%)" are numeric and not strings), this is correct.
- The `>= 50` condition checks that the "Battery Level (%)", a percentage value presumably stored as an integer or decimal, is greater than or equal to 50.<end>

What SQL query would you use to find all companies that have a market capitalization of at least $300 billion in each quarter where their stock price is greater than the average stock price across all sectors for that same quarter? The table structure consists of two tables: `companies` and `sector_market_cap`. The `companies` table contains columns for Company, Sector, Market Cap, Stock Price, and Quarter. The `sector_market_cap` table has columns for Sector, Market Cap Average, and Quarter.

| Company | Sector | Market Cap | Stock Price | Quarter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RetailHub | Energy | Large Cap | 298.32 | Q3 |
| HealthPlus | Retail | Large Cap | 385.85 | Q3 |
| RetailHub | Retail | Small Cap | 28.04 | Q3 |
| GlobalTrade | Automotive | Mid Cap | 511.56 | Q4 |
| RetailHub | Biotech | Mega Cap | 336.79 | Q1 |

The `sector_market_cap` table includes:

| Sector | Market Cap Average | Quarter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy | 500.00 | Q3 |
| Retail | 350.00 | Q3 |
| Automotive | 700.00 | Q4 |
| Biotech | 400.00 | Q1 |

Note: The market capitalization values in the `sector_market_cap` table are averages across each sector for their respective quarters, not individual company market caps.<start>Here is the SQL query that would solve this problem:

```sql
SELECT c.*
FROM companies c
JOIN sector_market_cap sm ON c.Sector = sm.Sector AND c.Quarter = sm.Quarter
WHERE c.Market Cap >= 300000000000 -- $300 billion in billions of dollars
AND c.Stock Price > (SELECT AVG(Market Cap Average) FROM sector_market_cap WHERE Quarter = c.Quarter)
```

This query works as follows:

1. The `JOIN` statement combines rows from the `companies` table with rows from the `sector_market_cap` table where the Sector and Quarter match.

2. The subquery `(SELECT AVG(Market Cap Average) FROM sector_market_cap WHERE Quarter = c.Quarter)` calculates the average market capitalization for each quarter across all sectors.

3. The final two conditions filter the results so that only companies with a Market Cap of at least $300 billion are returned, and also where their Stock Price is greater than the average stock price across all sectors in the same quarter.

However, this query would return duplicate rows if there are multiple companies in the same sector and quarter. If you want to avoid duplicates, consider using `DISTINCT` or aggregating functions like `MAX`, `MIN`, etc., depending on your needs.

If you're working with very large tables, it might be more efficient to calculate the average market capitalization for each quarter in a subquery or Common Table Expression (CTE), and then join this result with the companies table. Here's an example:

```sql
WITH avg_market_cap AS (
  SELECT Quarter, AVG(Market Cap Average) as avg_mc
  FROM sector_market_cap
  GROUP BY Quarter
)
SELECT c.*
FROM companies c
JOIN avg_market_cap amc ON c.Sector = amc.Quarter AND c.Quarter = amc.Quarter
WHERE c.Market Cap >= 300000000000 
AND c.Stock Price > amc.avg_mc;

Here is a SQL problem that requires SELECT with an OVER window function:

What is the total number of students who scored higher than their previous test score in each subject across all schools? The data is stored in two tables: `student_scores` and `school_info`. 

The `student_scores` table has columns for `student_id`, `subject`, `test_date`, `score`, and `previous_score`. The `school_info` table has columns for `school_id`, `name`, and `location`.

| student_id | subject | test_date | score | previous_score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Math | 2022-01-01 | 80 | 70 |
| 1 | Science | 2022-02-01 | 90 | 85 |
| 2 | English | 2022-03-01 | 95 | 92 |

| school_id | name | location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101 | Lincoln High School | New York |
| 102 | Washington Elementary School | California |
| 103 | Springfield Middle School | Illinois |

How can we use the OVER window function in a SELECT statement to calculate this total number of students who scored higher than their previous test score in each subject across all schools?<start>To solve this problem, you'll need to join the `student_scores` and `school_info` tables on `school_id`, then use the `OVER` window function with a conditional statement to count students who scored higher than their previous score. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(s.student_id) AS total_students,
    s.subject, 
    si.name as school_name
FROM 
    student_scores s
JOIN 
    school_info si ON s.school_id = si.school_id
WHERE 
    (s.score > s.previous_score)
GROUP BY 
    s.subject, si.name;
```

However, to get the total number of students who scored higher than their previous score in each subject across all schools, you'll need to remove the `GROUP BY` clause and use a subquery or a window function. Here's how you can modify the query using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(total_students) AS total
FROM (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(s.student_id) AS total_students,
        s.subject, 
        si.name as school_name
    FROM 
        student_scores s
    JOIN 
        school_info si ON s.school_id = si.school_id
    WHERE 
        (s.score > s.previous_score)
    GROUP BY 
        s.subject, si.name
) AS subquery;
```

Or using a window function:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(total_students) AS total
FROM (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY subject) AS total_students,
        subject
    FROM 
        student_scores s
    JOIN 
        school_info si ON s.school_id = si.school_id
    WHERE 
        (s.score > s.previous_score)
) AS subquery;
```

Both of these queries will return the total number of students who scored higher than their previous score in each subject across all schools.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires SELECT with LAG:

What would be the price range of each restaurant if we wanted to increase the price by 10% for restaurants that have the same cuisine as the one before it in alphabetical order? Assume we have a table called "restaurants" with the following columns and data:

| Restaurant Name | Cuisine | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Golden Spoon | Chinese | $$$ |
| Vegan Delight | American | $$$$ |
| Sushi World | French | $ |
| Burger Haven | Italian | $$$ |
| Pizza Planet | Japanese | $$$$ |
| Burger Haven | Mediterranean | $$ |
| Pizza Planet | Japanese | $ |
| Burger Haven | Mexican | $$$$$ |
| The Golden Spoon | Japanese | $$$ |

In other words, we want to add a new column "Price Range (Increased)" that increases the price by 10% if the cuisine is the same as the one before it in alphabetical order. We would then select this new column along with the original columns from the "restaurants" table. How can this be achieved using SQL with LAG?<start>Here's a SQL query that uses the LAG function to achieve the desired result:

```sql
SELECT 
    Restaurant Name,
    Cuisine,
    Price Range,
    CASE 
        WHEN Cuisine = LAG(Cuisine) OVER (ORDER BY Cuisine) THEN CAST(Price Range AS DECIMAL) * 1.10
        ELSE Price Range
    END AS "Price Range (Increased)"
FROM restaurants;
```

This query selects all columns from the "restaurants" table and adds a new column called "Price Range (Increased)". The CASE statement checks if the cuisine is the same as the one before it in alphabetical order, which is determined using the LAG function. If they are the same, then the price range is increased by 10% by multiplying it with 1.10; otherwise, the original price range is used.

Note: This assumes that you're working with a database system that supports window functions like SQL Server or PostgreSQL. If you're using MySQL, you would need to use a different approach since MySQL doesn't support LAG directly.<end>

What SQL query would you use to get the device type from the next reading for each sensor in the table, considering that a device is considered "next" if its timestamp is within one day of the current row's timestamp? The table contains readings for various devices with different types and timestamps.<start>To solve this problem, we'll use a subquery to get the maximum timestamp per sensor within a time window that ends at the current row's timestamp. We then filter the results to include only rows where the current reading is not older than the maximum found for its device type in that same time window.

Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT 
  s1.device_id,
  t2.device_type AS next_device_type
FROM 
  readings s1 -- alias your table as 's1'
JOIN 
  (SELECT 
     device_id, MAX(timestamp) AS max_timestamp
   FROM 
     readings
   WHERE 
     timestamp <= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 day'
   GROUP BY 
     device_id) s2 -- Group by device and take the most recent reading within a day
ON 
  s1.device_id = s2.device_id AND s1.timestamp > s2.max_timestamp
JOIN 
  devices t2 ON s1.device_type = t2.id
ORDER BY 
  s1.device_id;
```

However, since you want to get the next device type for each sensor considering only one day's difference in timestamps, and assuming your table has a timestamp column of datetime or date type, this query can be simplified into getting the next reading for each device if it is within one day.

This query joins the readings table with itself on the condition that the current row's timestamp is within one day of another row's timestamp, which we're considering as the "next" reading. It also joins this result with the devices table to get the type of the next reading for each device.

Here's how you can write it:

```sql
SELECT 
  r1.device_id,
  d.device_type AS next_device_type
FROM 
  readings r1 
JOIN 
  readings r2 ON ABS(DATEDIFF(r1.timestamp, r2.timestamp)) <= 86400 -- one day in seconds
WHERE 
  r1.timestamp > r2.timestamp
JOIN 
  devices d ON r2.device_id = d.id;
```

Note that the second query may not be as efficient as the first one because it joins on every pair of readings that are within a day's time difference, which can result in a lot of unnecessary rows if you have lots of data. However, it does exactly what your question asked for.

Also note that the SQL syntax might vary slightly based on the database management system (DBMS) used. The above query is written assuming MySQL or PostgreSQL but can be adapted to any DBMS by changing the date functions and interval syntax according to their respective documentation.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires ORDER BY:

What is the query to retrieve all rows from the `Books` table, ordered by the `Rating` column in descending order (highest rating first), and then further sorted by the `Genre` column in ascending order (alphabetically)? The output should show each author's name, book genre, and corresponding rating.<start>Here is the SQL query to solve the problem:

```sql
SELECT AuthorName, Genre, Rating 
FROM Books 
ORDER BY Rating DESC, Genre ASC;
```

Explanation:

- We select all columns we want from the `Books` table.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the output in descending order by `Rating`, meaning books with higher ratings are shown first. If two or more books have the same rating, they will be sorted alphabetically by their genre.

Example use case:

Suppose the `Books` table contains the following data:

| AuthorName | Genre | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John Doe | Fantasy | 8 |
| Jane Smith | Science Fiction | 7 |
| Bob Johnson | Romance | 6 |
| Alice Brown | Mystery | 5 |
| Mike Davis | Fantasy | 9 |

Running the above query on this table will return:

| AuthorName | Genre      | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mike Davis | Fantasy    | 9     |
| John Doe   | Fantasy    | 8     |
| Jane Smith | Science Fiction | 7     |
| Bob Johnson | Romance    | 6     |
| Alice Brown | Mystery    | 5     |<end>

Here's a SQL problem that requires GROUP BY:

What is the average temperature in degrees Celsius for each month of the year, considering data from all locations? The temperature data spans several years and we only have access to a table containing daily weather observations.

Assuming we have a table called "weather_data" with the following columns:
- date (DATE): The date of observation
- location (VARCHAR(255)): The city or town where the observation was made
- temperature_c (DECIMAL(4, 1)): The air temperature in degrees Celsius

We can use SQL to find this average monthly temperature.<start>**Average Temperature by Month**

To solve this problem, we'll need to group the data by month and calculate the average temperature for each month across all locations.

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month,
    AVG(temperature_c) AS avg_temperature_c
FROM 
    weather_data
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)
ORDER BY 
    month;
```

**Explanation**

1. We use the `EXTRACT` function to extract the month from each date, so we can group the data by month.
2. The `AVG` aggregation function calculates the average temperature for each month across all locations.
3. We group the data by the extracted month using the `GROUP BY` clause.
4. Finally, we order the results by month for easier interpretation.

This SQL query will return a list of average temperatures in degrees Celsius for each month of the year, aggregated from all locations.<end>

What is the SQL query to DROP a table named "Product_Info" which was created with a PRIMARY KEY constraint on the "SKU" column and contains data like:

| Product Name | SKU | Category |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gadget | SKU-1042 | Sports |
| Thingamajig | SKU-1070 | Toys |
| Gadget | SKU-1059 | Automotive |
| Widget | SKU-1072 | Automotive |

Note that I've assumed the table has been created with an auto-incrementing primary key on the "SKU" column, but this detail is not necessary for dropping the table. However, it might be useful to include in the query if you're planning to recreate the table later.<start>To drop a table named "Product_Info", you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
DROP TABLE Product_Info;
```

This query will delete the entire table and all its data.

Note: Be cautious when using this command, as it permanently deletes all rows in the specified table.

However, if you want to recreate the table with a PRIMARY KEY constraint on the "SKU" column (assuming a specific engine like InnoDB for MySQL), here is an example query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Product_Info (
  SKU INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Product_Name VARCHAR(255),
  Category VARCHAR(255),
  PRIMARY KEY (SKU)
);
```

This will create a new table with the specified columns and primary key constraint on the "SKU" column. If you're using an auto-incrementing ID in your original table, this should help you reproduce it.

Remember to replace `INT` and `VARCHAR(255)` with the actual data types used for each column if they differ from these examples.<end>

What SQL query would be needed to insert a new row into the "Movies" table with the following information: 
Title = "Star Wars", Genre = "Science Fiction", Rating = 3.8, and Release Year = 1977? The Movies table structure is as follows:
| Title | Genre | Rating | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Shawshank Redemption | Drama | 4.6 | 1994 |
| The Godfather | Crime | 4.2 | 1972 |

Note that the "Genre" column already exists in the table and contains duplicate values, so a query to add a new genre with its corresponding rating would also be required: 
| Genre | Rating |
| --- | --- |
| Science Fiction | 2.2 |
| Historical | 3.6 |
| Thriller | 4.5 |<start>To insert a new row into the "Movies" table, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
INSERT INTO Movies (Title, Genre, Rating, Release Year)
VALUES ('Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 3.8, 1977);
```

This query inserts a new row with the specified values.

However, since there's an existing "Genre" in the table and its corresponding rating is not provided in your question, but only in the table structure, you might want to insert a new genre with its rating first before inserting the movie into the Movies table. If that's the case, here's how you could do it:

First, insert the new genre with its rating:

```sql
INSERT INTO Genre (Genre, Rating)
VALUES ('Science Fiction', 3.8);
```

Then, insert the movie with the specified information and the new genre:

```sql
INSERT INTO Movies (Title, Genre, Rating, Release Year)
VALUES ('Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 3.8, 1977);
```

But considering you provided both title and genre of the movie and already have a "Genre" entry in your table structure with a rating of 2.2 for science fiction. If that's the case you can directly insert the movie into the Movies table without inserting it first.

Also note: if there are any dependencies or triggers on these tables that could interfere with this operation, they would need to be considered as well. The above SQL queries assume a simple scenario where no additional constraints are in place. 

However, if we're talking about real-world database schema design and considering relationships between tables (for example, if the Genre table had a primary key referencing itself), then you should probably normalize your data and consider creating a separate "MovieGenre" table to avoid redundancy in data. But that would require a more complex query involving joining or inserting into multiple tables which is not specified here.

The basic SQL syntax provided above assumes an isolated scenario where these considerations do not apply.<end>

What is a SQL query that will delete all instances of duplicate Director entries from the Movies table, leaving only one entry per director in the table? The Movies table has two columns: Director and Genre.<start>**Removing Duplicate Directors from the Movies Table**

To delete duplicate directors from the Movies table while keeping only one instance of each director's name, you can use a SQL query that groups the data by the `Director` column, selects one random row per group (to break ties), and then deletes those rows. Here's how to do it:

```sql
DELETE FROM Movies
WHERE Director IN (
  SELECT Director
  FROM (
    SELECT Director,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Director ORDER BY Genre) AS rn
    FROM Movies
  ) AS subquery
  WHERE rn > 1
);
```

**How the Query Works:**

1. The innermost query, `SELECT Director, ROW_NUMBER()...`, assigns a unique number (`rn`) to each row within groups of rows that have the same `Director` value, using the `PARTITION BY` clause.
2. The outer query selects only the `Director` values from these results where `rn > 1`. This means it selects all director names except those with an `rn` of 1 (i.e., their first appearance).
3. Finally, the outermost query deletes rows from the original `Movies` table where the `Director` is among the ones selected in step 2.

**Note:** This assumes you are using a SQL dialect that supports window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`.<end>

What SQL query would I need to use to increase the rating of all Japanese restaurants in California by 1 point? 

The relevant table is called "Restaurants" with columns:

- Cuisine
- Location (including city and state)
- Rating

For example, a row in this table might look like:
| Cuisine | Location | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Japanese | Carson, California | 2 |<start>To increase the rating of all Japanese restaurants in California by 1 point, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
UPDATE Restaurants
SET Rating = Rating + 1
WHERE Cuisine = 'Japanese' AND Location LIKE '%California%';
```

Here's how this query works:

- `UPDATE` is used to modify existing data.
- `Restaurants` is the name of the table where we want to make changes.
- `SET Rating = Rating + 1` increases each restaurant's rating by 1 point.
- `WHERE Cuisine = 'Japanese'` targets only Japanese restaurants.
- `AND Location LIKE '%California%'` further narrows down the selection to Japanese restaurants located in California. The `%` wildcard is used for a partial match, so this will find any location string containing "California". 

Note that you might want to add some error checking or a backup before running an UPDATE query on your actual database, especially if it's a live one with sensitive data!<end>

Here's an example SQL problem:

Can you create a table named "Device_Readings" to store data from various devices connected to our system? The table should have the following columns: 

- A unique identifier for each device (Device_ID), 
- the type of device (Device_Type) with possible values being 'Pressure Sensor', 'Light Sensor', and 'Humidity Sensor',
- a column to track the battery level of each device, represented as a percentage (Battery_Level). The table should be populated with some example data from existing devices:

| Device ID | Device Type | Battery Level (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| device-0001 | Pressure Sensor | 51.4 |
| device-0045 | Light Sensor | 65.4 |
| device-0017 | Pressure Sensor | 93.7 |
| device-0032 | Light Sensor | 16.9 |
| device-0099 | Humidity Sensor | 90.6 |
| device-0050 | Humidity Sensor | 78.7 |
| device-0012 | Humidity Sensor | 79.1 |

The query should create the "Device_Readings" table with the specified columns and insert the provided example data into it, maintaining the original relationships between the Device_ID, Device_Type, and Battery_Level.<start>Here is a SQL query that creates the `Device_Readings` table and populates it with the example data:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Device_Readings (
  Device_ID VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
  Device_Type VARCHAR(30),
  Battery_Level DECIMAL(5,2)
);

INSERT INTO Device_Readings (Device_ID, Device_Type, Battery_Level)
VALUES 
('device-0001', 'Pressure Sensor', 51.4),
('device-0045', 'Light Sensor', 65.4),
('device-0017', 'Pressure Sensor', 93.7),
('device-0032', 'Light Sensor', 16.9),
('device-0099', 'Humidity Sensor', 90.6),
('device-0050', 'Humidity Sensor', 78.7),
('device-0012', 'Humidity Sensor', 79.1);
```
Here's an explanation of the query:

* The `CREATE TABLE` statement creates a new table named `Device_Readings`.
* The `Device_ID` column is defined as a `VARCHAR(20)` to hold unique identifiers for each device.
* The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is added to ensure that each value in the `Device_ID` column is unique.
* The `Device_Type` column is defined as a `VARCHAR(30)` to hold possible values ('Pressure Sensor', 'Light Sensor', and 'Humidity Sensor').
* The `Battery_Level` column is defined as a `DECIMAL(5,2)` to hold decimal values with up to 5 digits before the decimal point and 2 digits after.
* The `INSERT INTO` statement populates the table with the example data from existing devices.

Note that this query assumes you are using a SQL database system that supports these data types and constraints (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). If you are using a different database system, you may need to modify the query accordingly.<end>

What SQL command would I use to add a new column called "Closing Price" to an existing table named "stock_prices", and populate it with data from another existing table named "daily_closing_prices" where the matching criteria is based on both the Company name and the date (which is not shown in this example but assumed to exist), assuming that "daily_closing_prices" has a column named "date" and the desired closing price for each stock is stored in the table under its respective company?<start>You can use an `UPDATE` statement with a subquery or a `JOIN` clause to add a new column to an existing table and populate it with data from another table. Here's one way to do it:

```sql
ALTER TABLE stock_prices
ADD COLUMN Closing_Price DECIMAL(10, 2);

UPDATE stock_prices sp
SET Closing_Price = (SELECT dc.Closing_Price
                     FROM daily_closing_prices dc
                     WHERE dc.Company = sp.Company AND dc.date = sp.date)
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM daily_closing_prices dc
    WHERE dc.Company = sp.Company AND dc.date = sp.date
);
```

However, be aware that this approach can lead to performance issues and scalability problems if your tables are large. This is because the subquery within the `UPDATE` statement is executed once for each row in the `stock_prices` table.

A better approach would be to use a single `UPDATE` statement with an inner join:

```sql
ALTER TABLE stock_prices
ADD COLUMN Closing_Price DECIMAL(10, 2);

UPDATE sp
SET Closing_Price = dc.Closing_Price
FROM stock_prices sp
INNER JOIN daily_closing_prices dc ON sp.Company = dc.Company AND sp.date = dc.date;
```

This approach is generally faster and more efficient than the subquery method, especially for large datasets.

Please note that this assumes your date column in `stock_prices` table is of a datetime or date type. If not, you should adjust the join accordingly.<end>

What SQL query would you use to select all rows from the 'stock_data' table where either the Market Cap is 'Mega Cap' and the Quarter is 'Q1', or the Stock Price is greater than 800? 

| Stock_ID | Market Cap | Stock Price | Quarter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S001    | Mega Cap   | 865.75     | Q1      |
| S002    | Mid Cap    | 128.58     | Q4      |
| S003    | Large Cap  | 432.27     | Q1      |
| S004    | Mega Cap   | 897.37     | Q1      |
| S005    | Mid Cap    | 637.17     | Q3      |
| S006    | Mega Cap   | 691.73     | Q1      |
| S007    | Mega Cap   | 971.55     | Q4      |
| S008    | Mega Cap   | 865.75     | Q3      |
| S009    | Small Cap  | 733.38     | Q4      |

The 'stock_data' table has the following schema:

- Stock_ID (primary key, integer)
- Market Cap (varchar(15))
- Stock Price (float)
- Quarter (varchar(5))<start>Here is the SQL query that would select all rows from the 'stock_data' table where either the Market Cap is 'Mega Cap' and the Quarter is 'Q1', or the Stock Price is greater than 800:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM stock_data
WHERE (Market Cap = 'Mega Cap' AND Quarter = 'Q1') OR Stock Price > 800;
```
Note that in SQL, we use parentheses to group conditions when using the `OR` operator. This ensures that both conditions must be met for the first part of the condition (`Market Cap = 'Mega Cap' AND Quarter = 'Q1'`) before checking if the second condition (`Stock Price > 800`) is true.

Also, note that we don't need to quote the column names (e.g. `Market Cap` becomes just `MarketCap`) unless they contain special characters or are reserved keywords in SQL. However, I've kept them quoted for clarity and consistency with the original schema definition.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all devices along with their location and battery level, even if there are no readings for them in the "readings" table? The query should include all columns from both tables, but only where the device ID exists in the "devices" table. Assume that the relevant data is stored in two tables:

Devices
| Device ID | Location |
| --- | --- |
| device-0038 | Kitchen |
| device-0098 | Bedroom |
| device-0084 | Garage |
| device-0082 | Bedroom |
| device-0091 | Living Room |
| device-0009 | Living Room |
| device-0005 | Garden |
| device-0057 | Hallway |
| device-0036 | Hallway |
| device-0074 | Garage |

Readings
| Device ID | Reading Value | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- |
| device-0038 | 32.26 | 2021-06-10 20:01:55 |
| device-0098 | -33.03 | 2022-04-21 03:20:56 |
| device-0084 | 51.36 | 2021-02-20 19:33:02 |
| device-0082 | 67.16 | 2022-11-24 03:37:27 |
| device-0091 | 24.31 | 2021-09-18 06:34:08 |
| device-0009 | -6.28 | 2021-10-28 11:13:34 |
| device-0005 | 81.1 | 2021-09-16 01:45:40 |
| device-0057 | 27.04 | 2022-06-27 12:16:40 |
| device-0036 | 46.04 | 2023-06-26 05:51:52 |
| device-0074 | -30.3 | 2022-01-09 21:43:13 |

The desired output should have all columns from both tables, but only where the Device ID exists in the "devices" table.<start>To achieve this, you can use a LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) to include all rows from one table that match rows from another table, and also return all rows from the other table that don't have matches. Here's how you would construct your query:

```sql
SELECT 
    d.Device ID,
    d.Location,
    r.Reading Value AS BatteryLevel,
    r.Timestamp
FROM 
    devices d
LEFT JOIN 
    readings r ON d.Device ID = r.Device ID;
```

This query will include all columns from both tables where the device ID exists in the "devices" table, even if there are no readings for them in the "readings" table.

Explanation:
- The SELECT statement selects all columns (`*`) from the `devices` and `readings` tables.
- The FROM clause specifies that we're working with the `devices` table as `d`.
- The LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) syntax is used to select data from two or more tables. It returns all rows from the left-hand table (`devices`) and the matched rows from the right-hand table (`readings`). If there are no matches, it will return NULL on the right-hand side.
- The ON clause specifies the condition for joining the two tables based on the `Device ID` field.

This query assumes that you want to return all columns. If you only need specific columns, replace `*` with those column names in the SELECT statement.<end>

Here is an example SQL problem that requires a SELECT with a RIGHT JOIN:

What is the most recent publication year for each author in the "Fantasy Authors" database, along with the author's name? The authors table has the following structure:
| Author ID | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | J.T. Gilbert |
| 2 | R.A. Salvatore |
| 3 | Terry Brooks |

The books table has the following structure:
| Book ID | Title | Publication Year | Author ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Crystal Key | 1995 | 1 |
| 2 | The Crystal Key | 1996 | 1 |
| 3 | The Forgotten World | 2006 | 2 |
| 4 | Legends of the Rift | 1987 | 3 |
| 5 | Legends of the Rift | 2008 | 3 |

Note: An author can have multiple books, and a book is always associated with one author. I want to join these two tables using a RIGHT JOIN, where each author's most recent publication year will be displayed along with their name, even if they don't have any books in the database.<start>To solve this problem, we'll use a combination of the `MAX` function and a `RIGHT JOIN`. We want to get the most recent publication year for each author, so we'll first calculate that using a subquery or a CTE (Common Table Expression), then join it with the authors table.

Here's how you can solve this problem in SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    a.Name AS Author,
    MAX(b.Publication_Year) AS Latest_Publication_Year
FROM 
    Authors a
RIGHT JOIN 
    Books b ON a.Author_ID = b.Author_ID
GROUP BY 
    a.Name;
```

In this query, we join the `authors` and `books` tables on their respective `Author ID` fields. The `RIGHT JOIN` ensures that all authors are included in the results, even if they don't have any books.

However, since we want to get the most recent publication year for each author, using a subquery might be more straightforward:

```sql
SELECT 
    Author,
    Latest_Publication_Year
FROM (
    SELECT 
        a.Name AS Author,
        b.Publication_Year,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY a.Author_ID ORDER BY b.Publication_Year DESC) AS RowNum
    FROM 
        Authors a
    JOIN 
        Books b ON a.Author_ID = b.Author_ID
) t
WHERE 
    RowNum = 1;
```

This query uses the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign each book publication year in descending order of its value, so that the most recent one gets assigned '1', and partitions this numbering by author. It then selects only rows where `RowNum` is equal to `1`, which gives us the latest publication year for each author.

Both queries should give you the desired output:

| Author       | Latest_Publication_Year |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| J.T. Gilbert | 1996                     |
| R.A. Salvatore| 2006                     |
| Terry Brooks | 2008                     |

Note that if an author has no books, their latest publication year will be `NULL` in the first query or missing from the results of both queries.<end>

What is a SQL query that selects all restaurant names along with their highest ratings from two tables: "Restaurants" and "Ratings", where Ratings.Restaurant_ID matches Restaurants.ID and includes only restaurants with cuisine type 'Mexican' or 'Italian', ordered by the highest rating in descending order? 

Table details:

- "Restaurants"
  | ID | Restaurant Name | Cuisine |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1   | Pasta Palace   | Japanese|
  | 2   | Sushi World     | Italian |
  | 3   | The Steakhouse | Mexican  |
  | 4   | Vegan Delight  | French   |
  | 5   | Taco Town      | Mexican  |

- "Ratings"
  | ID | Restaurant_ID | Rating |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1  | 3            | 1     |
  | 2  | 3            | 5     |
  | 3  | 4            | 5     |
  | 4  | 5            | 5     |
  | 5  | 7            | 1     |
  | 6  | 10           | 1     |
  | 7  | 10           | 2     |
  | 8  | 13           | 1     |
  | 9  | 13           | 1     |
  | 10 | 13           | 1     |<start>Here is the SQL query that fulfills your request:
```sql
SELECT 
    R.Restaurant_Name, 
    MAX(Ratings.Rating) AS Highest_Rating
FROM 
    Restaurants R 
JOIN 
    Ratings ON R.ID = Ratings.Restaurant_ID
WHERE 
    R.Cuisine IN ('Mexican', 'Italian')
GROUP BY 
    R.Restaurant_Name
ORDER BY 
    Highest_Rating DESC;
```
Let me explain how this query works:

1. We join the "Restaurants" and "Ratings" tables on the condition that `Restaurant_ID` in "Ratings" matches `ID` in "Restaurants".
2. We filter out restaurants with cuisine types other than 'Mexican' or 'Italian'.
3. We group the results by restaurant name, using the `MAX` function to get the highest rating for each restaurant.
4. Finally, we order the results by the highest rating in descending order.

Assuming the input tables are as described above, this query will return:
```markdown
+------------------------+---------------+
| Restaurant_Name         | Highest_Rating |
+------------------------+---------------+
| Taco Town               | 5             |
| Sushi World              | 5             |
| The Steakhouse          | 5             |
| Vegan Delight           | (no matching)  |
| Pasta Palace            | (no matching)  |
+------------------------+---------------+
```
Note that "Vegan Delight" and "Pasta Palace" do not appear in the results because they have cuisine types other than 'Mexican' or 'Italian'.<end>

Here's a SQL problem that requires SELECT with a FULL JOIN:

What is the average latency (in ms) of all queries per second measurements between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, including measurements where there was no query activity during this time period? The data comes from two tables: `query_activity` and `query_inactivity`.

The `query_activity` table contains the actual query measurements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE query_activity (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    queries_per_second DECIMAL(10, 2),
    average_latency DECIMAL(5, 2),
    timestamp DATE
);
```

The `query_inactivity` table contains records of days where there was no query activity:
```sql
CREATE TABLE query_inactivity (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE
);
```

Some example data is provided for both tables:

**query_activity:**
| Queries per Second | Average Latency (ms) | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 275.15 | 74.73 | 2021-09-20 14:04:42 |
| 241.72 | 52.6 | 2022-11-25 00:54:13 |
| 2525.54 | 54.63 | 2022-10-12 23:14:53 |
| 1001.41 | 8.84 | 2021-03-03 15:56:08 |

**query_inactivity:**
| Date |
| --- |
| 2022-01-01 |
| 2022-02-28 |
| 2022-12-31 |
```

Can you write a SQL query that performs a FULL JOIN on these two tables and returns the average latency of all queries per second measurements between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, including measurements where there was no query activity during this time period?<start>You can use a `FULL JOIN` to join the two tables together. Since you're interested in getting the average latency of all queries per second measurements between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, including measurements where there was no query activity during this time period, we'll include both tables in the FULL JOIN.

Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(qa.average_latency, qi.average_latency) AS average_latency,
    COUNT(DISTINCT qa.id) + COUNT(DISTINCT qi.id) AS total_measures
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM query_activity WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' AND timestamp <= '2022-12-31'
) q 
FULL JOIN (
    SELECT id, average_latency FROM query_inactivity
) i ON TRUE
```

However, since there's no `average_latency` column in the `query_inactivity` table, we'll have to use `NULL` as a placeholder for it. If you want to calculate the average latency based on zero queries per second (i.e., assume an average latency of 0), you can do so with this query:

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(qa.average_latency, 0) AS average_latency,
    COUNT(DISTINCT qa.id) + COUNT(DISTINCT qi.id) AS total_measures
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM query_activity WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' AND timestamp <= '2022-12-31'
) q 
FULL JOIN (
    SELECT id, 0 AS average_latency FROM query_inactivity
) i ON TRUE;
```

Note: FULL JOIN is a standard SQL operation (ANSI/ISO 9075-2), but it may not be supported by all databases.<end>

What SQL query can be used to retrieve a list of cuisines that have multiple locations in different states? The table containing this information is named "Restaurants" and has two columns: "Cuisine" and "Location". Assume there are no duplicate entries, but some cuisines may appear more than once if they have restaurants in multiple cities across the same state.<start>To solve this problem, you can use a SQL query that groups the results by cuisine, counts the number of unique states for each cuisine, and then selects those cuisines with more than one unique state.

Here's how you might write such a query:

```sql
SELECT 
    Cuisine,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Location) AS NumLocations
FROM 
    Restaurants
GROUP BY 
    Cuisine
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT Location) > 1;
```

This query works as follows:
- `SELECT Cuisine, COUNT(DISTINCT Location) AS NumLocations` selects the cuisine and counts the number of unique locations (cities or states in this context) for each cuisine. The `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` syntax is used to count distinct values within a column.
- `FROM Restaurants` specifies that the data comes from the "Restaurants" table.
- `GROUP BY Cuisine` groups the rows by cuisine. This means that all restaurants serving the same type of food will be counted together in terms of locations across different states or cities.
- `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Location) > 1` is a filter clause applied to the grouped results. It ensures that only cuisines with more than one unique location are included in the output.

However, if your goal is specifically to find cuisines that have restaurants in multiple locations across different states, you would need to adapt this approach slightly because the current query counts cities rather than states. Assuming "Location" includes the state name as well, or using a separate table with state information if it's not directly available from "Restaurants", you could adjust the query to reflect this:

```sql
SELECT 
    Cuisine,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Location) AS NumStates
FROM 
    Restaurants
GROUP BY 
    Cuisine
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT Location) > 1;
```

Or, if you're considering a scenario where state names are not directly present in the "Restaurants" table:

```sql
SELECT 
    R.Cuisine,
    COUNT(DISTINCT S.State) AS NumStates
FROM 
    Restaurants R
JOIN 
    (SELECT DISTINCT Location FROM Restaurants) L ON LEFT(R.Location, 1) = LEFT(L.Location, 1)
JOIN 
    (SELECT DISTINCT Location FROM Restaurants) S ON RIGHT(R.Location, 3) = RIGHT(S.Location, 3)
GROUP BY 
    R.Cuisine
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT S.State) > 1;
```

In this adjusted query:
- The `Location` is first split into a state and the rest of the string (city name), using `LEFT()` for the state (assuming it's always in the first three characters for simplicity).
- Then, for each restaurant, you match its state with all other states. This way, if there are restaurants in different cities within the same state, they will still be counted together.

Please adjust this approach based on your actual data structure and how states are represented within it.<end>

What SQL query would return all movie titles from the Movies table where the title contains the word 'Starbound' and is either an Adventure or a Thriller?<start>Here is the SQL query that would achieve this:
```sql
SELECT title 
FROM Movies 
WHERE title LIKE '%Starbound%' AND genre IN ('Adventure', 'Thriller');
```
Explanation:

* `LIKE '%Starbound%'` will match any string that contains the word 'Starbound' (the `%` wildcard matches any characters before and after 'Starbound').
* `AND genre IN ('Adventure', 'Thriller')` will filter the results to only include rows where the `genre` column is either 'Adventure' or 'Thriller'.

Note: This query assumes that the `Movies` table has a `title` column for movie titles, a `genre` column with possible values of 'Adventure' and/or 'Thriller', and that the data type of these columns are suitable for string matching (e.g. VARCHAR, CHAR).<end>

What SQL query would you use to select all company names where the "High Price" is NULL on a specific date (e.g., '2019-09-02') from the 'stock_prices' table?<start>You can use the following SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT company_name 
FROM stock_prices 
WHERE high_price IS NULL AND price_date = '2019-09-02';
```

In this query:

*   `SELECT company_name` specifies that we want to retrieve only the company name from the table.
*   `FROM stock_prices` indicates that we are querying the 'stock_prices' table.
*   `WHERE high_price IS NULL` selects rows where the "High Price" is NULL. The `IS NULL` operator checks if a value is NULL, which is different from checking for an empty string using `high_price = ''`.
*   `AND price_date = '2019-09-02'` filters the results to only include rows where the date is '2019-09-02'.

Note that this query assumes that there are no duplicate company names on '2019-09-02'. If you need to handle duplicates (e.g., return multiple rows for a single company), you'll want to modify the query accordingly.<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve all database names from the 'database_metrics' table where the 'cache_hit_ratio' is greater than 85% but the 'queries_per_second' is NULL? 

| Database Name | Queries per Second | Cache Hit Ratio (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OrdersDB | 2227.64 | 87.75 |
| ProfilesDB | 973.77 | 80.22 |
| SessionsDB | 1705.85 | 93.62 |
| MetricsDB | 3272.78 | 70.99 |
| LogsDB | 695.45 | 86.06 |
| OrdersDB | 4916.87 | 77.44 |
| SalesDB | 3861.85 | 77.01 |
| MetricsDB | 105.54 | 90.1 |
| SalesDB | 4159.63 | 81.46 |

Assume the 'database_metrics' table has a schema like this: 

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| database_name | varchar(255) | The name of the database |
| queries_per_second | float | The number of queries per second for the database |
| cache_hit_ratio | float | The cache hit ratio for the database |<start>Here is the SQL query that would retrieve all database names from the 'database_metrics' table where the 'cache_hit_ratio' is greater than 85% but the 'queries_per_second' is NULL:
```sql
SELECT 
    database_name 
FROM 
    database_metrics 
WHERE 
    cache_hit_ratio > 85 AND queries_per_second IS NULL;
```
This query uses the `IS NULL` operator to check for records where the 'queries_per_second' field is null, and also includes a filter on the 'cache_hit_ratio' field being greater than 85.

Note: The `AND` operator is used because we want both conditions (cache hit ratio > 85 and queries per second IS NULL) to be true in order for a record to be included in the result set.<end>

What SQL query would you use to extract the average temperature and humidity values from each location that has an average temperature above 10°C, grouped by city? 

Table: `weather_data`

| Location      | Temperature (C) | Humidity (%) |
| ---           | ---             | ---         |
| Fort Pierce   | 7.5             | 35          |
| Placentia     | 23.2            | 66          |
| Westland      | -0.3            | 55          |
| Aurora        | 26.3            | 55          |
| Pine Bluff    | 13.1            | 54          |
| Oshkosh       | 13.1            | 22          |

This data is based on the following averages:

| Location      | Temperature (C) Average | Humidity (%) Average |
| ---           | ---                     | ---                 |
| Fort Pierce   | 7.5                     | 35                  |
| Placentia     | 23.2                    | 66                  |
| Westland      | -0.3                    | 55                  |
| Aurora        | 26.3                    | 55                  |
| Pine Bluff    | 13.1                    | 54                  |
| Oshkosh       | 13.1                    | 22                  |

Note: The averages are the same as the provided data for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario you would calculate these yourself or have them provided to you.<start>To solve this problem, we can use the `AVG` aggregation function along with the `HAVING` clause to filter out locations with an average temperature below 10°C.

Here's the SQL query that extracts the desired data:
```sql
SELECT 
  Location,
  AVG(Temperature (C)) AS Average_Temperature,
  AVG(Humidity (%)) AS Average_Humidity
FROM weather_data
GROUP BY Location
HAVING AVG(Temperature (C)) > 10;
```
This query:

1. Groups the `weather_data` table by `Location`.
2. Calculates the average temperature and humidity for each location.
3. Filters out locations with an average temperature below 10°C using the `HAVING` clause.

Note that we're grouping by the `Location` column, not the calculated averages. This is because we want to preserve the relationship between the location and its corresponding average values.

When you run this query on your sample data, it will return:
```markdown
+------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
| Location   | Average_Temperature   | Average_Humidity     |
+------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
| Placentia  | 23.2                  | 66                   |
| Aurora      | 26.3                  | 55                   |
| Pine Bluff  | 13.1                  | 54                   |
+------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
```<end>

What SQL query can I use to get a list of movies (assuming "Whispers of the Abyss" appears twice in the ratings table) ordered by their overall average rating across all versions, and then include an additional column that shows the rank of each movie based on its average rating within the same set, from highest to lowest? The ratings data is stored in the following table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Ratings (
  Title VARCHAR(255),
  Rating DECIMAL(3,1)
);
```

| Title | Rating |
| --- | --- |
| Legends of the Rift | 1.9 |
| Whispers of the Abyss | 5.0 |
| The Last Sky | 4.6 |
| Tales of the Brave | 1.6 |
| Echoes of Eternity | 4.7 |
| Whispers of the Abyss | 2.9 |
| Shadows of Solitude | 3.8 |
| A Journey Through Time | 2.6 |
| A Journey Through Time | 1.2 |

I need to calculate the average rating per movie title (ignoring any duplicates) and then rank them accordingly, with the highest overall average getting ranked #1, the next highest #2, etc.<start>You can use a SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT 
  Title,
  AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(Rating) DESC) AS Rank
FROM 
  Ratings
GROUP BY 
  Title;
```

This will return all movie titles, their overall average rating across all versions, and a rank based on that average rating. If two movies have the same average rating, they'll both get the same rank (e.g., if there's a tie for #2 and another movie is ranked #3, then the next highest average will be ranked #4, not #3).

However, keep in mind that SQL doesn't directly support reusing results from subqueries as input to functions like `RANK()`. In this case, we're using the `AVG()` aggregation function directly on the result set.

The query groups by title and then calculates the average rating per group. The ranking is based on these average ratings, ordered in descending order (highest first).

To handle duplicate titles and their corresponding ratings correctly (i.e., ensure the average rating for each unique title doesn't include a movie's multiple ratings), you can simply remove any duplicates from your original Ratings table before running this query, or modify it to group by Title after sorting the ratings in ascending order, which isn't directly relevant here.<end>

What SQL query would return a list of people who have an income greater than their previous year's income (assuming each person's birth month represents the order of years), along with the difference in income? The table "IncomeData" has the following columns: Name, Age, BirthMonth, State, and Income.<start>To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query that involves window functions to compare each person's current income with their previous year's income. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    Name,
    Age AS CurrentAge,
    BirthMonth - 1 AS PreviousYear,
    Income AS CurrentIncome,
    (BirthMonth < 2 AND State != 'State where birth occurs in February') OR (Age = 1) AS IsNewPerson,
    CASE 
        WHEN ((CASE WHEN BirthMonth > 2 THEN Age ELSE Age + 1 END) * 12 + BirthMonth - 1 = BirthMonth)
            AND (BirthMonth < 2 AND State != 'State where birth occurs in February') OR Age = 1
            THEN NULL 
        ELSE Income - (SELECT MAX(Income) FROM IncomeData WHERE Name = i.Name AND BirthMonth > 1 AND BirthMonth <= i.BirthMonth AND (Age = i.Age OR BirthMonth < 2 AND State != 'State where birth occurs in February')) END AS IncomeDifference
FROM 
    IncomeData i
WHERE 
    (CASE WHEN BirthMonth > 2 THEN Age ELSE Age + 1 END) * 12 + BirthMonth - 1 = BirthMonth
    OR (BirthMonth < 2 AND State != 'State where birth occurs in February') OR Age = 1
ORDER BY 
    Name;
```

This query first creates a condition to select only rows for which the birth month equals the year based on their age, and those who are born before March of any given year. It then selects all columns from the "IncomeData" table where this condition is met.

However, for people with ages less than 1 (i.e., they're not yet a year old) or who were born in January or February of any given year, we need to adjust their age and calculate their income difference by comparing it with the maximum income they had in the previous year. The final result will be ordered alphabetically by name.

This query assumes that you want to compare each person's current income with their income from the previous year (i.e., the row just before them based on birth month order). Note that it also accounts for people who are not yet a year old or were born in January/February as per your assumptions. If these conditions don't apply, the query can be simplified.

Here's an alternative approach using window functions like LAG:

```sql
SELECT 
    Name,
    Age AS CurrentAge,
    BirthMonth - 1 AS PreviousYear,
    Income AS CurrentIncome,
    (BirthMonth < 2 AND State != 'State where birth occurs in February') OR (Age = 1) AS IsNewPerson,
    Income - LAG(Income, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY CASE WHEN BirthMonth > 2 THEN Age ELSE Age + 1 END * 12 + BirthMonth - 1) AS IncomeDifference
FROM 
    IncomeData i
WHERE 
    (CASE WHEN BirthMonth > 2 THEN Age ELSE Age + 1 END) * 12 + BirthMonth - 1 = BirthMonth
    OR (BirthMonth < 2 AND State != 'State where birth occurs in February') OR Age = 1
ORDER BY 
    Name;
```

This query does essentially the same thing as the previous one but uses window functions like LAG to compare each person's current income with their previous year's income. The PARTITION BY clause ensures that we're comparing incomes for the same person, and the ORDER BY clause is used to order the rows by the "year" based on birth month. If there are no previous rows (i.e., it's a new person), LAG will return NULL, so we check for that condition in our main query when calculating income difference.

Note: The above queries assume you're using SQL Server or PostgreSQL where window functions like LAG are supported. Other databases might have slightly different syntax or capabilities.<end>

What SQL query would you use to retrieve a list of movies from the "Movies" table along with the next highest Box Office Earnings (in millions) for each movie, assuming that the box office earnings are listed in ascending order by Release Year? 

The Movies table is defined as:
| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year | Box Office Earnings (M) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rise of the Titans | Orin Shadowalker | Sci-Fi | 2011 | 399.83 |
| Mystery of the Depths | Drake Nightshade | Action | 2016 | 940.91 |
| Mystery of the Depths | Aria Ravenwood | Adventure | 1970 | 286.65 |
| Starbound Odyssey | Drake Nightshade | Fantasy | 1994 | 222.68 |
| Edge of Infinity | Zara Stormrider | Sci-Fi | 1980 | 976.97 |
| The Great Expedition | Mara Moonshadow | Adventure | 1982 | 680.72 |
| Rise of the Titans | Lira Silverleaf | Sci-Fi | 2011 | 303.18 |
| Starbound Odyssey | Orin Shadowalker | Comedy | 1992 | 877.79 |
| The Final Voyage | Cade Firebrand | Fantasy | 1986 | 193.04 |

Note: The box office earnings are already listed in ascending order by Release Year.<start>To solve this problem, we can use a subquery to get the next highest Box Office Earnings for each movie. However, since the box office earnings are already sorted by release year, we can take advantage of this fact and simply select the row that is one position ahead in the table.

Here's how you could do it:

```sql
SELECT 
  M1.Title,
  M1.Director,
  M1.Genre,
  M1.Release_Year AS Current_Release_Year,
  M1.Box_Office_Earnings_M AS Current_Box_Office,
  M2.Box_Office_Earnings_M AS Next_Highest_Box_Office
FROM 
  Movies M1
JOIN 
  (SELECT 
     Box_Office_Earnings_M,
     Release_Year
   FROM 
     Movies
   WHERE 
     Rownum <= (SELECT COUNT(*) / 2 + 1 FROM Movies)) M2 ON M1.Release_Year = M2.Release_Year - 1;
```

However, this query assumes the movies are evenly distributed across the years. If that's not the case, we'd need a different approach.

A more general and reliable solution would be to use window functions. Here's how you could do it:

```sql
WITH Ranked_Movies AS (
  SELECT 
    Title,
    Director,
    Genre,
    Release_Year,
    Box_Office_Earnings_M,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Release_Year) AS RowNumber,
    LAG(Box_Office_Earnings_M, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY Release_Year) AS Previous_Box_Office
  FROM 
    Movies
)
SELECT 
  Title,
  Director,
  Genre,
  Release_Year AS Current_Release_Year,
  Box_Office_Earnings_M AS Current_Box_Office,
  CASE
    WHEN RowNumber > 1 THEN LAG(Box_Office_Earnings_M, 1, NULL) OVER (ORDER BY Release_Year)
    ELSE NULL
  END AS Next_Highest_Box_Office
FROM 
  Ranked_Movies;
```

This query works by first ranking each movie in order of release year. Then it uses the lag function to get the previous box office earnings for each movie. If a movie is not the second earliest, then its next highest box office will be null.

Note that this assumes your database management system supports window functions (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server).<end>

What SQL query can be used to retrieve the stock prices of all companies from the `stock_data` table, ordered by their `Close Price` in ascending order?<start>**SQL Query: Retrieving Stock Prices by Close Price**
=====================================================

Here is a SQL query that retrieves the stock prices of all companies from the `stock_data` table, ordered by their `Close Price` in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM stock_data
ORDER BY Close_Price ASC;
```

Let's break down this query:

*   `SELECT *`: This selects all columns (`*`) from the `stock_data` table.
*   `FROM stock_data`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve data, which is `stock_data`.
*   `ORDER BY Close_Price ASC;`: This orders the result set by the `Close Price` column in ascending order (`ASC`).

**Example Use Case:**
--------------------

Suppose you have a `stock_data` table with columns for the company name, stock symbol, trading date, and close price. You want to retrieve all stocks ordered by their closing prices on a specific day.

```markdown
# Example Stock Data Table

| Company_Name | Stock_Symbol | Trading_Date  | Close_Price |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Apple         | AAPL         | 2022-01-01    | 150.23      |
| Microsoft     | MSFT         | 2022-01-01    | 320.19      |
| Google        | GOOGL         | 2022-01-01    | 2900.88     |
```

To retrieve the stocks ordered by their closing prices, you can use the above SQL query.

**Note:** Make sure to replace `Close_Price` with the actual column name in your table if it differs from the example provided.<end>

What SQL query can I use to find the average temperature in each month of the year, grouping by the 'Month' column which is implied from the 'Day' column (where Monday = January, Tuesday = February etc.) and ignoring the 'Wind Speed' column? The data is stored in a table called 'WeatherData'.<start>You can use the following SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DAY) AS Month,
    AVG(TEMPERATURE) AS Average_Temperature
FROM 
    WeatherData
WHERE 
    WIND_SPEED IS NULL -- ignoring rows with non-null 'Wind Speed'
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DAY);
```

However, if the 'Day' column is of type `DATE` or a similar date-related data type, and not just a string representation of the day of the week (in which case you should adjust the EXTRACT to extract the DAY instead), this query will already work fine.

Please note that in SQL Server, you can use `MONTH()` function from the DATEPART() function if the 'Day' column is of type DATETIME:

```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(Day) AS Month,
    AVG(TEMPERATURE) AS Average_Temperature
FROM 
    WeatherData
WHERE 
    WIND_SPEED IS NULL -- ignoring rows with non-null 'Wind Speed'
GROUP BY 
    MONTH(Day);
```

If the `DAY` column represents a string (e.g., "Monday"), you should use this query instead:

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN DAY = 'Monday' THEN 1
          WHEN DAY = 'Tuesday' THEN 2
          -- continue with other days of the week
          ELSE NULL END AS Month,
    AVG(TEMPERATURE) AS Average_Temperature
FROM 
    WeatherData
WHERE 
    WIND_SPEED IS NULL -- ignoring rows with non-null 'Wind Speed'
GROUP BY 
    CASE WHEN DAY = 'Monday' THEN 1
          WHEN DAY = 'Tuesday' THEN 2
          -- continue with other days of the week
          ELSE NULL END;
```<end>

What is the correct SQL query to drop a specific table from a database that contains multiple tables with different structures, including a "Movies" table and an "UpcomingMovies" table that both have a "MovieTitle" column but are defined differently:

Movies table:
```sql
| MovieID | MovieTitle  | ReleaseYear |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
|       1 | Rise of the Titans | 2011        |
|       2 | The Endless Horizon | 1981        |
|       3 | The Final Voyage   | 1970        |
```

UpcomingMovies table:
```sql
| MovieID | MovieTitle  | ReleaseYear | Rating    |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
|      10 | Beyond the Veil| 2015        | PG-13     |
|      11 | Starbound Odyssey| 1986       | G         |
|      12 | The Great Expedition | 1984       | PG        |
```

The programmer wants to drop the "UpcomingMovies" table but is unsure how to do so without affecting the data in the other tables. What SQL query should they use to safely remove this specific table?<start>To safely drop a specific table from a database, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
DROP TABLE UpcomingMovies;
```

This query will delete only the "UpcomingMovies" table and its data without affecting any other tables. 

Note: Before dropping the table, it's always a good practice to check if the table exists first, especially when working with databases that contain multiple tables. You can do this using the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` or `pg_tables` views (depending on your database system). Here is an example query for PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'UpcomingMovies';
```

If you're unsure about dropping a table, it's always better to err on the side of caution and double-check before proceeding.<end>

What SQL query would you use to insert a new restaurant called "Sushi Spot" with Japanese cuisine and a price range of $$$$, while also keeping track of the total number of restaurants in the database? The relevant table is named "Restaurants" with the following structure:

| Restaurant Name | Cuisine      | Price Range |
| ---             | ---          | ---         |
| BBQ Barn        | French       | $$$$$       |
| Taco Town       | Mediterranean| $           |
| Burger Haven    | French       | $$          |
| Pizza Planet    | Italian      | $$          |

The table "Restaurants" has an auto-incrementing ID (Primary Key) column named "ID", a "Restaurant Name" column, a "Cuisine" column, and a "Price Range" column.<start>To insert the new restaurant while also keeping track of the total number of restaurants in the database, you would use an SQL query that updates a separate table or a counter after inserting the record into the main "Restaurants" table. However, since your request is about both inserting and counting, I'll provide two solutions:

1. **Simple Insert:** This approach just inserts the new restaurant without maintaining any external count.
2. **Insert with Counter Update (using an additional table):** To maintain a total count of restaurants in the database, you would typically use another table to keep this information, often named "Counts" or similar. For simplicity, let's assume we're using a separate query to update a counter after the insertion.

Let's start with the straightforward approach first:

### Simple Insert Query

```sql
INSERT INTO Restaurants (Restaurant Name, Cuisine, Price Range)
VALUES ('Sushi Spot', 'Japanese', '$$$$');
```

This insert statement adds a new restaurant named "Sushi Spot" with Japanese cuisine and a price range of $$$$. The auto-incrementing ID will be automatically assigned by the database.

### Insert with Counter Update Query

For this, you would need an additional table (e.g., "RestaurantCounts") to keep track of your total count. Here's how you might structure that:

First, let's assume we have a "RestaurantCounts" table with just one column, "Count", which keeps the current number of restaurants.

```sql
CREATE TABLE RestaurantCounts (
  Count INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
);
```

Then, to insert the new restaurant and update the count in "RestaurantCounts", you would use:

```sql
INSERT INTO Restaurants (Restaurant Name, Cuisine, Price Range)
VALUES ('Sushi Spot', 'Japanese', '$$$$');

UPDATE RestaurantCounts SET Count = COUNT(*) FROM Restaurants;
```

However, directly updating a table with a result of a query is generally not the best approach as it bypasses potential triggers or views. Instead, you can update your count after ensuring the insert was successful:

```sql
SET @NewID = NULL;

INSERT INTO Restaurants (Restaurant Name, Cuisine, Price Range)
VALUES ('Sushi Spot', 'Japanese', '$$$$')
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ID=LAST_INSERT_ID(ID);

UPDATE RestaurantCounts SET Count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Restaurants);
```

The `(ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE)` part is MySQL-specific and might need to be adapted based on your actual SQL dialect if it doesn't support this syntax. This ensures that you're updating the count accurately even after failures or concurrent updates.

Remember, managing counts in a database can get complex with concurrency issues; consider using transactions for atomicity if necessary.

### Important Note:
- Always back up your data before executing any script.
- Ensure you have the correct privileges to create and modify tables and execute queries on them.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires DELETE:

Can you write a SQL query to delete all rows from the "Books" table where the publication year is before 1990, except for books with a title of either "Echoes of Eternity" or "The Forgotten World"? The Books table has columns "Title" and "Publication Year". If multiple rows match these conditions, all matching rows should be deleted.<start>Here's how you can write the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
DELETE 
FROM 
Books
WHERE (Publication_Year < 1990) AND Title NOT IN ('Echoes of Eternity', 'The Forgotten World');
```

In this query, `NOT IN` is used with a list of titles. If a title from the list exists in any row being checked, that row won't be deleted, effectively keeping those specific books even if their publication year is before 1990.<end>

What SQL query can be used to update the 'Income' column in the 'employees_table' table where the 'Birth Month' is either 'March', 'April', or 'December' and set the income to 30% more than what it currently is, but not exceeding $1,000,000?<start>Here's a SQL query that updates the `Income` column based on your conditions:

```sql
UPDATE employees_table 
SET Income = LEAST(Income * 1.3, 1000000) 
WHERE Birth_Month IN ('March', 'April', 'December');
```

Let me explain how this works:

- The `IN` keyword is used to check if the value in a column matches any of the specified values.
- The `LEAST()` function returns the smallest of its arguments, preventing income from exceeding $1,000,000 when updated by 30%.
- The `* 1.3` expression calculates a 30% increase on the current income value.

**Note:** This assumes that there's no need to round or handle decimal places in the income values. If you do have such requirements, additional steps may be necessary.

Before running this query, make sure you have backups of your database and perform the update operation in a test environment first if possible.<end>

What is the correct SQL query to create a table called "Authors" with columns for "Author ID", "Name", and "Birth Year", and another table called "Books" with columns for "Book ID", "Title", "Genre", "Publication Year", and "Rating", assuming that an author can write multiple books but each book has only one author?<start>**SQL Code to Create Tables**
```sql
-- Create the Authors table
CREATE TABLE Authors (
  Author_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  Birth_Year DATE
);

-- Create the Books table with a foreign key referencing the Authors table
CREATE TABLE Books (
  Book_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Title VARCHAR(255),
  Genre VARCHAR(50),
  Publication_Year DATE,
  Rating DECIMAL(3,2),
  Author_ID INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (Author_ID) REFERENCES Authors(Author_ID)
);
```
**Explanation**

In the above SQL code:

* We create two tables: `Authors` and `Books`.
* The `Authors` table has three columns:
	+ `Author_ID`: a unique identifier for each author, which serves as the primary key.
	+ `Name`: the name of the author.
	+ `Birth_Year`: the birth year of the author (optional).
* The `Books` table has five columns:
	+ `Book_ID`: a unique identifier for each book, which serves as the primary key.
	+ `Title`: the title of the book.
	+ `Genre`: the genre of the book.
	+ `Publication_Year`: the publication year of the book.
	+ `Rating`: the rating of the book (optional).
* We establish a foreign key relationship between the `Books` table and the `Authors` table using the `Author_ID` column. This ensures that each book is associated with only one author, while an author can write multiple books.

**Example Use Case**

To insert data into these tables, you would use INSERT statements like this:
```sql
INSERT INTO Authors (Author_ID, Name, Birth_Year)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', '1970-01-01');

INSERT INTO Books (Book_ID, Title, Genre, Publication_Year, Rating, Author_ID)
VALUES (1, 'My Book', 'Fiction', '2022-01-01', 4.5, 1);
```
This example inserts an author named John Doe with a birth year of January 1970 and associates him with a book titled "My Book".<end>

What SQL command can I use to add a new column called "Price" with a data type of decimal(10,2) to the existing table named "Inventory" if there are already 200 rows in the table and the current columns are "Product Name", "SKU", "Stock Quantity", "Category", and "Supplier Name"?<start>You can use the following SQL command to add a new column called "Price" with a data type of decimal(10,2) to the existing table named "Inventory":

```sql
ALTER TABLE Inventory
ADD Price DECIMAL(10, 2);
```

However, if you want to specify a default value for the new column (e.g., NULL), you can use:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Inventory
ADD Price DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT NULL;
```

If you're not sure whether the table has 200 rows or not, you can simply execute this command. If there are fewer than 200 rows in the table when it's created or modified to meet that requirement, this will work fine.

Note: If the table already exists with a different data type for "Price", you'll get an error message like "Cannot add a new column on existing columns". In this case, you should drop and recreate the table (or use a SQL tool where it's easier to manage this).<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires SELECT:

What is the average stock quantity of all products supplied by "Wonka Industries", grouped by category? 

Suppose we have two tables: `products` and `suppliers`. The relevant columns are as follows:
- `products`: `Product Name`, `SKU`, `Stock Quantity`, `Category`
- `suppliers`: `Supplier ID`, `Supplier Name`

The `products` table has the following example data:
| Product Name | SKU | Stock Quantity | Category |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instrument | SKU-1077 | 208 | Household |
| Contraption | SKU-1096 | 440 | Electronics |
| Thingamajig | SKU-1089 | 305 | Electronics |
| Instrument | SKU-1097 | 468 | Automotive |
| Instrument | SKU-1093 | 289 | Toys |
| Gizmo | SKU-1016 | 127 | Electronics |
| Instrument | SKU-1037 | 137 | Electronics |
| Gadget | SKU-1018 | 386 | Sports |

The `suppliers` table has the following example data:
| Supplier ID | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- |
| S001 | Wonka Industries |
| S002 | Globex |<start>Here's a SQL query that should solve this problem:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.Category, 
    AVG(p.Stock_Quantity) AS Average_Stock_Quantity
FROM 
    products p
JOIN 
    suppliers s ON p.SKU = 'SKU-1016'  -- Replace with actual SKU of Wonka Industries or a condition to get supplier name
WHERE 
    s.Supplier_Name = 'Wonka Industries'
GROUP BY 
    p.Category;
```

However, this query won't work because we can't filter products by supplier in the join clause directly. Also, we have multiple SKUs for "Instrument" which belong to different categories.

Here's a correct way to write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.Category, 
    AVG(p.Stock_Quantity) AS Average_Stock_Quantity
FROM 
    products p
JOIN 
    suppliers s ON p.SKU IN ('SKU-1077', 'SKU-1096', 'SKU-1089', 'SKU-1093', 'SKU-1016', 'SKU-1037', 'SKU-1018')  -- Replace with actual SKUs of Wonka Industries
WHERE 
    s.Supplier_Name = 'Wonka Industries'
GROUP BY 
    p.Category;
```

However, this will only work if we know all the SKUs for "Wonka Industries" and they are hardcoded. If there's a dynamic way to get the supplier name or SKU, then you should replace that condition with your actual logic.

A more robust approach would be:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.Category, 
    AVG(p.Stock_Quantity) AS Average_Stock_Quantity
FROM 
    products p
JOIN 
    suppliers s ON p.SKU IN (  -- This is where we need to get the actual SKUs of Wonka Industries dynamically or by joining with another table.
        SELECT SKU 
        FROM products
        JOIN suppliers ON products.SKU = suppliers.Supplier_ID
        WHERE suppliers.Supplier_Name = 'Wonka Industries'
    )
GROUP BY 
    p.Category;
```

This will work if you can get the SKUs of Wonka Industries from `products` and `suppliers`. But please note that it assumes a one-to-one relationship between products and suppliers, which is not usually the case.<end>

Here's an example SQL problem that requires a SELECT with a LEFT JOIN:

Given two tables: "Servers" and "PerformanceMetrics", where:
- The "Servers" table contains information about available servers.
- The "PerformanceMetrics" table contains performance metrics for each server.

The "Servers" table has the following columns:
| Server ID | Name      |
| --- | --- |
| 1       | Server A |
| 2       | Server B |
| 3       | Server C |

The "PerformanceMetrics" table has the following columns:
| Metric ID | Server ID | Queries per Second | Cache Hit Ratio (%) | Average Latency (ms) | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1         | 1       | 4062.97          | 70.93               | 87.06              | 2021-01-15 01:12:53 |
| 2         | 1       | 930.68           | 71.47               | 31.96              | 2023-07-16 15:53:54 |
| 3         | 2       | 3910.61          | 90.89               | 84.7               | 2023-02-23 01:12:36 |
| 4         | 2       | 1001.68          | 80.81               | 8.66               | 2022-08-14 08:47:15 |

What SQL query would you use to get the server name and average queries per second for each server, even if there are no performance metrics available?<start>Here's a SQL query that uses LEFT JOIN to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    S.ServerID,
    S.Name AS ServerName,
    COALESCE(PQPS.QueriesPerSecondAverage, 0) AS AverageQueriesPerSecond
FROM 
    Servers S
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT 
         ServerID,
         AVG(QueriesPerSecond) AS QueriesPerSecondAverage
     FROM 
         PerformanceMetrics
     GROUP BY 
         ServerID) PQPS ON S.ServerID = PQPS.ServerID;
```

Let's break down this query:

1. The subquery in the FROM clause selects the `ServerID` and calculates the average `QueriesPerSecond` for each server from the `PerformanceMetrics` table. It groups by `ServerID`.
2. The main SELECT statement joins the `Servers` table with the subquery on the `ServerID` column.
3. The COALESCE function returns the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions. If there are no performance metrics available for a server, `PQPS.QueriesPerSecondAverage` will be NULL. In that case, COALESCE returns 0.

This query returns the following result:

| Server ID | ServerName    | AverageQueriesPerSecond |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1       | Server A     | 9999.65               |
| 2       | Server B     | 1001.64               |
| 3       | Server C     | 0                     |

As expected, the average queries per second for Server C is 0 because there are no performance metrics available for that server.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all companies from the Companies table with their latest stock prices (Close Price) along with the average High and Low Prices of all stocks traded on the same date in the Stocks table? The Companies table has columns Company, Date, Open Price, Close Price, Low Price, Volume, and StockID. The Stocks table contains columns StockID, StockDate, HighPrice, LowPrice. Assume that there are duplicate dates for multiple companies.<start>Here is a SQL query that should accomplish what you're looking for:
```sql
SELECT 
  C.Company,
  S.ClosePrice AS LatestClosePrice,
  AVG(S.HighPrice) AS AverageHighPrice,
  AVG(S.LowPrice) AS AverageLowPrice
FROM Companies C
JOIN Stocks S ON C.StockID = S.StockID AND C.Date = S.StockDate
GROUP BY C.Company, S.ClosePrice
ORDER BY C.Company;
```
However, this query will not return the latest Close Price for each company. To get that, we need to join the Companies table with a subquery that gets the maximum Date for each StockID:
```sql
SELECT 
  C.Company,
  L.ClosePrice AS LatestClosePrice,
  AVG(S.HighPrice) AS AverageHighPrice,
  AVG(S.LowPrice) AS AverageLowPrice
FROM Companies C
JOIN (
  SELECT StockID, MAX(Date) AS MaxDate
  FROM Companies
  GROUP BY StockID
) D ON C.StockID = D.StockID AND C.Date = D.MaxDate
JOIN Stocks S ON C.StockID = S.StockID AND C.Date = S.StockDate
GROUP BY C.Company, L.ClosePrice
ORDER BY C.Company;
```
But this query will return duplicate rows if there are multiple companies with the same latest Close Price. To avoid that, we can use a subquery to get the maximum Date and Close Price for each StockID:
```sql
SELECT 
  Company,
  LatestClosePrice,
  AverageHighPrice,
  AverageLowPrice
FROM (
  SELECT 
    C.Company,
    S.ClosePrice AS LatestClosePrice,
    AVG(S.HighPrice) AS AverageHighPrice,
    AVG(S.LowPrice) AS AverageLowPrice,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY C.Company ORDER BY C.Date DESC) AS RN
  FROM Companies C
  JOIN Stocks S ON C.StockID = S.StockID AND C.Date = S.StockDate
  GROUP BY C.Company, S.ClosePrice
) T
WHERE T.RN = 1;
```
This query will return the latest Close Price for each company along with the average High and Low Prices of all stocks traded on the same date.

Note: The ROW_NUMBER() function is used to assign a unique row number to each group of rows (i.e., for each company), ordered by Date in descending order. The subquery selects the row where RN = 1, which corresponds to the latest Close Price for each company.

However, this query uses the ROW_NUMBER() function which might not be supported in all SQL databases. Here's a version that uses the MAX() and MIN() functions instead:
```sql
SELECT 
  Company,
  LatestClosePrice,
  AverageHighPrice,
  AverageLowPrice
FROM (
  SELECT 
    C.Company,
    S.ClosePrice AS LatestClosePrice,
    AVG(S.HighPrice) AS AverageHighPrice,
    AVG(S.LowPrice) AS AverageLowPrice,
    CASE WHEN D.MaxClosePrice IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END + 
    CASE WHEN S.ClosePrice = D.MaxClosePrice AND C.Date = D.MaxDate THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS RN
  FROM Companies C
  JOIN Stocks S ON C.StockID = S.StockID AND C.Date = S.StockDate
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT StockID, MAX(Date) AS MaxDate, MAX(ClosePrice) AS MaxClosePrice
    FROM Stocks
    GROUP BY StockID
  ) D ON C.StockID = D.StockID
  GROUP BY C.Company, S.ClosePrice, D.MaxDate, D.MaxClosePrice
) T
GROUP BY Company, LatestClosePrice;
```
This query uses a LEFT JOIN to get the maximum Close Price and Date for each StockID. The CASE statement is used to assign a row number (RN) to each group of rows. The subquery selects only the rows where RN = 1, which corresponds to the latest Close Price for each company.

Please note that this query might not be as efficient as the previous one using ROW_NUMBER(), especially for large tables.<end>

Here is a SQL problem that requires SELECT with an INNER JOIN:

Note that the timestamp is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.<start>Here's a SQL query to solve this problem using an INNER JOIN:

```sql
SELECT 
    d.DeviceType, 
    r.ReadingValue 
FROM 
    Devices d 
INNER JOIN 
    Readings r ON d.DeviceID = r.DeviceID AND 
                    d.Timestamp = r.Timestamp AND 
                    CAST(SUBSTR(r.Timestamp, 1, 10) AS DATE) = '2023-12-26' AND
                    d.Location IN ('Hallway', 'Office') AND
                    d.BatteryLevel > 50
WHERE 
    d.DeviceType LIKE 'Light Sensor';
```

Here's a brief explanation of how the query works:

1. We join the `Devices` table with the `Readings` table on several conditions:
   - The `DeviceID` is the same in both tables.
   - The timestamps are the same, which ensures that we're comparing battery levels at the exact same time for each device.
   - The date part of the timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD) must be December 26th, 2023.
   - Only devices with a location of 'Hallway' or 'Office' and a battery level above 50% are considered.

2. We then select the `DeviceType` and `ReadingValue` columns from the joined tables, where the device type matches our target ('Light Sensor').<end>

What is the SQL query to retrieve a list of all movies from two tables, "Movies" and "Sequels", that includes all columns for each movie, even if there are no matches between the two tables?

The "Movies" table has the following structure:

| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Endless Horizon | Zara Stormrider | Drama | 2001 |
| Beyond the Veil | Talon Blackthorn | Horror | 1994 |

The "Sequels" table has the following structure:

| Title | Director | Genre | Release Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Beyond the Veil | Mara Moonshadow | Action | 1980 |
| Beyond the Veil | Drake Nightshade | Thriller | 1982 |
| Beyond the Veil | Rylan Frostblade | Adventure | 1990 |
| Beyond the Veil | Zara Stormrider | Sci-Fi | 1988 |

Note that "Beyond the Veil" has multiple entries in both tables, representing different sequels. The goal is to return all columns for each movie from both tables, even if there are no matching titles between them.<start>To achieve this, you can use a SQL query with `LEFT JOIN` or `UNION ALL` and then select distinct rows using `DISTINCT` or aggregate functions like `GROUP BY`. However, considering the task, the most straightforward approach is to use `FULL OUTER JOIN` if your database supports it (most modern databases do). If not, you can fall back on a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and another query to pick up any "orphan" rows.

Here's how you might accomplish this using both methods for comparison:

### Using FULL OUTER JOIN

If your SQL implementation supports full outer joins directly (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL 8+), the query would be straightforward:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Movies
FULL OUTER JOIN Sequels ON Title = Title;
```

This will return all rows from both tables, with `NULL` values in the columns of the table that is not present for a particular row.

### Using LEFT JOIN and ORPHANS (for SQL implementations without FULL OUTER JOIN)

If your database doesn't support full outer joins directly, you can simulate this behavior using left joins for one direction and then unioning it with an inverted version:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Movies
LEFT JOIN Sequels ON Title = Title;

UNION ALL

SELECT *, NULL AS Title, NULL AS Director, NULL AS Genre, NULL AS Release Year
FROM Sequels
WHERE Title NOT IN (SELECT Title FROM Movies);
```

In the case where there's a `Title` in "Sequels" but not in "Movies", the `LEFT JOIN` would return `NULL` for "Movie" columns. The second part of the query directly selects such rows from "Sequels".

### Choosing the Method

If your database supports full outer joins, that method is simpler and more efficient. Otherwise, the combination approach works but can be slightly less intuitive due to the need to manually specify `NULL` values for non-matching rows.

**Note:** Be cautious with the second method if there's any possibility of titles in "Sequels" not being in the actual list of movie titles (because it assumes a simple existence check based on the provided data structure).<end>

What SQL query would I use to find the stock prices of all companies in a given sector that have a market capitalization greater than or equal to the average market cap of all companies in that same sector?

Assuming we have two tables:

**Companies**
| Company | Sector | Market Cap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TechCorp | Retail | 5000 |
| FinanceWorks | Automotive | 1000000 |
| GlobalTrade | Healthcare | 20000 |
| Foodies | Retail | 400000 |
| Amazon | Technology | 1500000 |

**MarketCaps**
| Sector | Average Market Cap |
| --- | --- |
| Retail | 30000 |
| Automotive | 750000 |
| Healthcare | 50000 |

I'd like to join these two tables on the sector column and get a list of companies with market caps greater than or equal to their respective average market caps.<start>You can use a SQL query with a JOIN operation and a WHERE clause to solve this problem. Here is an example query:

```sql
SELECT C.Company, C.Market_Cap, MC.Average_Market_Cap
FROM Companies C
JOIN MarketCaps MC ON C.Sector = MC.Sector
WHERE C.Market_Cap >= MC.Average_Market_Cap;
```

This will return the companies with market caps greater than or equal to their respective average market caps. However, this query may not be very efficient if you have a large number of companies and/or sectors because it involves a full table scan.

A more efficient way would be to use a subquery:

```sql
SELECT Company, Market_Cap
FROM Companies C
WHERE Market_Cap >= (
  SELECT Average_Market_Cap
  FROM MarketCaps MC
  WHERE MC.Sector = C.Sector
);
```

This query first calculates the average market cap for each sector using a subquery, and then filters the companies based on whether their market caps are greater than or equal to these averages.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all products from the "Products" table where the product name contains the word 'Doohickey' in any case sensitivity (i.e., 'DOOHICKEY', 'doohickey', etc.) and the category is either 'Household' or 'Electronics'? 

| Product Name | SKU | Price | Stock Quantity | Category | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Doohickey | SKU-1044 | 266.12 | 259 | Household | Wonka Industries |
| Thingamajig | SKU-1097 | 154.85 | 431 | Electronics | Umbrella Corp |
| Apparatus | SKU-1094 | 266.42 | 75 | Sports | Globex |
| Widget | SKU-1085 | 15.23 | 240 | Household | Wonka Industries |
| Doohickey | SKU-1005 | 155.79 | 207 | Household | Wayne Enterprises |
| Doohickey | SKU-1007 | 136.49 | 13 | Automotive | Wayne Enterprises |
| Gadget | SKU-1040 | 13.64 | 439 | Automotive | ACME Corp |
| Doohickey | SKU-1095 | 449.87 | 153 | Electronics | Wayne Enterprises |
| Doohickey | SKU-1076 | 431.58 | 347 | Household | Umbrella Corp |

Note: The table and data provided is for illustration purposes only and may not be comprehensive or accurate in a real-world scenario.<start>Here is the SQL query that will return all products from the "Products" table where the product name contains the word 'Doohickey' in any case sensitivity and the category is either 'Household' or 'Electronics':

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE LOWER(Product_Name) LIKE '%doohickey%' AND Category IN ('Household', 'Electronics');
```

Here's a breakdown of how this query works:

1. `LOWER(Product_Name)` converts the product name to lowercase so that we can search for 'Doohickey' in any case sensitivity.
2. `'%'` is a wildcard character in SQL that matches any characters before or after it, effectively searching for 'Doohickey' anywhere in the product name.
3. `AND Category IN ('Household', 'Electronics')` filters the results to only include products from the 'Household' or 'Electronics' categories.

When you run this query on your sample data, it will return:

| Product Name | SKU | Price | Stock Quantity | Category | Supplier Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Doohickey | SKU-1044 | 266.12 | 259 | Household | Wonka Industries |
| Widget | SKU-1085 | 15.23 | 240 | Household | Wonka Industries |
| Doohickey | SKU-1005 | 155.79 | 207 | Household | Wayne Enterprises |
| Doohickey | SKU-1076 | 431.58 | 347 | Household | Umbrella Corp |
| Doohickey | SKU-1095 | 449.87 | 153 | Electronics | Wayne Enterprises |

Note that this query will return multiple rows for the product 'Doohickey' since it appears in multiple categories.<end>

What is a SQL query that will return all rows from the 'trips' table where the start location is unknown (i.e., NULL), regardless of whether the trip name appears more than once? 

The trips table structure is as follows:
| Trip Name | Start Location | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Example data:
| Trip Name | Start Location | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desert Drive | San Francisco | 15.2 | 32.1 |
| Valley Voyage | Houston | 50.6 | 43.7 |
| Desert Drive | Houston | 25.2 | 82.0 |
| Valley Voyage | New York | 42.9 | 28.2 |
| Forest Journey | San Francisco | 58.6 | 62.3 |

The table has the following columns: Trip Name, Start Location, Duration (hours), and Fuel Used (gallons).<start>Here is a SQL query that will return all rows from the 'trips' table where the start location is unknown (i.e., NULL):
```sql
SELECT *
FROM trips
WHERE Start Location IS NULL;
```
Explanation:

* The `IS NULL` clause checks for null values in the `Start Location` column.
* The `WHERE` clause filters out rows that do not meet this condition.

Alternatively, you can use a more concise syntax:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM trips
WHERE Start_Location = NULL;
```
However, it's worth noting that this syntax is database-specific and may not work in all SQL dialects. The first syntax using `IS NULL` is generally safer and more portable.

Example output:

| Trip Name | Start Location | Duration (hours) | Fuel Used (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desert Drive | NULL | 25.2 | 82.0 |

Assuming the example data you provided, this query will return one row where the start location is unknown.<end>

What SQL query would retrieve all columns from the "Books" table where there is a value in the "Author" column that does not match an author in the "Published Books" table's "Author" column? The "Books" and "Published Books" tables have the following structures:

**Books**
| Title | Author | Genre |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Forgotten World | Thorne Ironwood | Non-Fiction |
| The Last Sky | Galen Starfire | Horror |
| Echoes of Eternity | Luna Silverleaf | Romance |

**Published Books**
| Title | Author | Published Year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Forgotten World | Orion Frostblade | 2016 |
| The Silent Grove | Galen Starfire | 1983 |
| The Crystal Key | Elara Moonshadow | 1996 |

However, the "Author" column in the "Published Books" table contains an incorrect value for one of the books:
| Title | Author | Published Year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Forgotten World | Orion Frostblade | 2016 |
| The Silent Grove | Thorne Ironwood | 1983 |
| The Crystal Key | Elara Moonshadow | 1996 |

Note: In this scenario, the value for "The Silent Grove" in the "Published Books" table is incorrect as it should be Galen Starfire instead of Thorne Ironwood.<start>To retrieve all columns from the "Books" table where there is a value in the "Author" column that does not match an author in the "Published Books" table's "Author" column, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Books b
WHERE b.Author NOT IN (
  SELECT Author
  FROM Published_Books
);
```

However, using `NOT IN` with a subquery can lead to performance issues if the "Published Books" table is very large.

A more efficient approach would be to use a `LEFT JOIN` or an anti-join. Here's how you could rewrite the query:

```sql
SELECT b.*
FROM Books b
LEFT JOIN Published_Books pb ON b.Author = pb.Author AND b.Title = pb.Title
WHERE pb.Title IS NULL;
```

This will return all columns from the "Books" table where there is no matching row in the "Published Books" table. 

However, since you are looking for a match based on author alone (and not title), we can simplify it:

```sql
SELECT b.*
FROM Books b
LEFT JOIN Published_Books pb ON b.Author = pb.Author
WHERE pb.Author IS NULL;
```

This query will be more efficient and also more readable. It joins the two tables on the "Author" column, then selects all columns from the "Books" table where there is no match in the "Published Books" table (i.e., `pb.Author` is null).<end>

What SQL query would you use to find the total number of restaurants in each price range ($, $$, $$, $$$$, and $$$$$) that have an average rating greater than 3 among all locations with at least two restaurants? 

Assuming we have a table "Restaurants" with the following structure:

| Restaurant Name | Cuisine | Location | Rating | Price Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vegan Delight | American | League City, Texas | 2 | $$ |
| The Steakhouse | Chinese | Atlantic City, New Jersey | 4 | $$ |
| BBQ Barn | American | Meridian, Idaho | 4 | $$$$$ |
| Vegan Delight | American | Colorado Springs, Colorado | 5 | $ |
| Pasta Palace | Mediterranean | Baytown, Texas | 4 | $ |
| Sushi World | Italian | Conway, Arkansas | 1 | $$$$$ |
| Sushi World | Mexican | Westerville, Ohio | 3 | $$$$ |
| The Steakhouse | Chinese | Rock Hill, South Carolina | 5 | $$$$ |
| The Steakhouse | Italian | Wilmington, Delaware | 1 | $$$ |
| Sushi World | French | South Jordan, Utah | 4 | $$$$$ |

And we want to group the restaurants by their price range, then select only those groups with an average rating greater than 3 among all locations that have at least two restaurants.<start>Here is the SQL query that would accomplish this:
```sql
SELECT 
    Price_Range,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Restaurants,
    AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Location,
        Price_Range,
        Rating
    FROM Restaurants
    GROUP BY Location, Price_Range
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
) AS Grouped_Restaurants
GROUP BY Price_Range
HAVING MAX(Average_Rating) > 3;
```
Let me explain how this query works:

1. The subquery first groups the restaurants by location and price range, and then filters those groups to only include locations with at least two restaurants (`GROUP BY Location, Price_Range` followed by `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2`).
2. The subquery returns a table with columns for location, price range, and rating.
3. The outer query takes this result set and groups it again by price range (using the `Price_Range` column from the subquery).
4. For each group of restaurants, we count the total number of restaurants (`COUNT(*) AS Total_Restaurants`) and calculate the average rating (`AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating`).
5. Finally, we filter these groups to only include those where the maximum average rating is greater than 3 (`HAVING MAX(Average_Rating) > 3`). This ensures that we only see price ranges with an overall average rating greater than 3 among all locations.

Note that this query assumes that you want to count the total number of restaurants in each price range, even if some individual locations within that price range have fewer than two restaurants. If you want to filter out those price ranges entirely, you can replace the `HAVING MAX(Average_Rating) > 3` clause with a more restrictive condition, such as `HAVING AVG(Rating) > 3`.<end>

What is the SQL query to calculate the ranking of a stock's price within each sector across all quarters, but only consider rows where the stock's price in the current quarter is greater than the stock's price in the previous quarter, without using subqueries? Assume we have two tables: `Stocks` with columns `Sector`, `Stock Price`, and `Quarter`, and a separate table `Previous Prices` containing the sector name and the stock price of each sector in the previous quarter to facilitate this comparison. The `Previous Prices` table has columns `Sector`, `Price Previous Quarter`.<start>To solve this problem without using subqueries, you can perform an INNER JOIN between the `Stocks` and `Previous Prices` tables based on the sector, then compare the current stock price with the previous quarter's stock price. After that, use a window function like ROW_NUMBER() or RANK() to rank each row within sectors across all quarters where the condition is met.

Assuming you are using SQL Server 2012 or later because of the `ROW_NUMBER()` function used here, and based on the description provided, your query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    S.Sector,
    S.`Stock Price`,
    P.`Price Previous Quarter`,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY S.Sector ORDER BY S.Quarter) AS StockPriceRank
INTO #RankedPrices
FROM Stocks S
INNER JOIN PreviousPrices P ON S.Sector = P.Sector
WHERE S.`Stock Price` > P.`Price Previous Quarter`;
```

However, this query does not directly rank the stock price within each sector across all quarters only considering rows where the current quarter's stock price is greater than the previous quarter's. To achieve that, consider joining `PreviousPrices` with a derived table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) from `Stocks` that already filters for the condition you're interested in.

Here's how you could modify the query to rank the prices while considering only the increases:

```sql
WITH RankedIncreases AS (
    SELECT 
        S.Sector,
        S.`Stock Price`,
        P.`Price Previous Quarter`
    FROM Stocks S
    INNER JOIN PreviousPrices P ON S.Sector = P.Sector
    WHERE S.`Stock Price` > P.`Price Previous Quarter`
)
SELECT 
    Sector,
    `Stock Price`,
    `Price Previous Quarter`,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Sector ORDER BY `Stock Price`) AS StockPriceRankWithinSectorIncrease
FROM RankedIncreases;
```

This query first filters the data to include only sectors and quarters where the stock price increased over the previous quarter. Then it ranks these increases within each sector based on their new value.

Remember, you can also use `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()` if you want to handle ties in ranking differently. However, for precise control of how rankings are assigned when there are multiple rows with the same `Stock Price` (e.g., when they all increase from the previous quarter's price), consider using a window function specifically designed for this purpose.

This approach avoids subqueries by using CTEs and window functions, making it more scalable and efficient for larger datasets.<end>
