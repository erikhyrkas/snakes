EXT. DOWNTOWN METROPOLIS - DAY

We see a bustling metropolis, with towering skyscrapers and flying cars zipping through the air. Suddenly, a massive explosion rocks the city.

CUT TO:

INT. PARAGON PROTOCOL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A team of scientists and engineers, led by the charismatic and brilliant Dr. Elianore Quasar (40s), work frantically in front of large computer screens.

DR. QUASAR
(urgently)
Alright, team! We're running out of time! Our calculations indicate the convergence event is imminent!

The team nods, working with a sense of urgency.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN METROPOLIS - DAY

As the explosion fades away, people begin to emerge from their hiding places, confused and frightened. A figure emerges from the smoke: MAX WILSON (30s), a former Army Ranger turned private security operative.

MAX
(into comms device)
This is Max Wilson. I've got visual on a catastrophic event. Requesting backup.

Suddenly, strange energy readings begin to appear across the city's screens and monitors.

CUT TO:

INT. PARAGON PROTOCOL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The team looks at each other in alarm as Dr. Quasar rushes towards them.

DR. QUASAR
(gravely)
The Protocol has initiated! The Paragon frequency is amplifying the city's energy grid!

The team works feverishly to contain the situation, while Max receives a mysterious message from an unknown sender:

MAX
(into comms device)
This is Max Wilson. I've got a message. From...whoever did this? Be prepared for more. The Paragon protocol has been activated.

Max looks at his hand, which begins to glow with energy emanating from it. He takes off in his advanced tactical suit, determined to investigate and protect the city.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN METROPOLIS - DAY

As the energy readings continue to increase, the air around Max seems to vibrate with electricity. People begin to notice strange, glowing marks on their skin.

MAX
(to himself)
What's happening?

Suddenly, a massive energy wave erupts across the city, imbuing its inhabitants with incredible powers.

CUT TO:

Pandemonium breaks out as people begin to develop superpowers: A young woman lifts a skyscraper; a group of gang members turn into swirling vortex creatures; and Max himself transforms into a being of pure energy.

MAX
(to the camera, now empowered)
I've never felt so alive. But with this power comes great responsibility. I'll be watching over you all - from every angle, until we figure out what's going on here.

The city continues to evolve, as new heroes and villains emerge. Dr. Quasar watches in awe, knowing that the Paragon Protocol will change everything.

**Act I:**

(Opening shot of a small, isolated town in the middle of nowhere. The camera pans across the empty streets before landing on a quaint little diner. We see JESSICA (28), a young woman with a messy bob and a warm smile, walking out of the diner and into the bright sunlight.)

Jessica: (to herself) Time to get some supplies.

(She gets into her rusty old truck and drives off-screen. We see her driving through the empty streets, before finally pulling up to an old, abandoned house on the outskirts of town.)

Jessica: (to herself) This should do.

(Jessica steps out of the truck and looks around cautiously, as if she's worried someone is watching her. She approaches the creaky front door and pushes it open.)

**Act II:**

(We see Jessica exploring the dusty old house, looking for supplies to stock up on. As she wanders deeper into the house, we start to notice strange things - doors slamming shut on their own, objects moving in the corner of our eye.)

Jessica: (whispering to herself) This is ridiculous.

(Suddenly, a door slams shut behind her. Jessica spins around, panicked.)

Jessica: Who's there?!

(There's no response. She slowly approaches the door and tries to open it. But when she does, we see that she's face-to-face with an old man - a decrepit figure with sunken eyes and a menacing grin.)

Old Man: (in a gravelly voice) You shouldn't be here.

Jessica: What are you talking about?

(The Old Man starts to talk in riddles, telling Jessica about the house being cursed. He warns her that if she stays too long, she'll forget everything - including who she is and how she got there.)

**Act III:**

(As the Old Man continues to spook Jessica, we see strange visions flashing through her mind - memories of a life she's forgotten. We see glimpses of a happy childhood, a loving family, and a young love that went sour.)

Jessica: (scared) What do you want from me?!

Old Man: I'm not doing anything. You're just... remembering.

(As the visions intensify, Jessica starts to lose her grip on reality. She becomes disoriented and paranoid, convinced that the Old Man is trying to drive her mad.)

**Climax:**

(Jessica turns on the Old Man, determined to get out of the house alive. But as she tries to leave, we see that the doors are sealed shut - as if the house itself is trying to keep her trapped.)

Jessica: (screaming) No! No!

(The camera spins wildly as Jessica becomes more and more unhinged. We see visions of a dark past, one that's been hidden from her for years.)

**Resolution:**

(As Jessica finally escapes the house, we see her stumbling out into the bright sunlight, confused and disoriented. She looks up at the sky, gasping for air - as if she's just remembered something important.)

Jessica: (whispering) My name is Jessica...

(The camera lingers on her face, a look of horror and despair etched across it. And then, suddenly, everything goes black.)

**The Whispering Dead**

(As the credits roll, we hear whispers - faint, disembodied voices that seem to come from nowhere and everywhere at once.)

Voice: (whispering) Remember...

(The whispering grows louder, until it's almost deafening. We see glimpses of other victims, trapped in their own memories - victims of The Whispering Dead.)

Voice: (whispering) Forget...

(The camera zooms out, as the whispers fade into the distance. And then, suddenly, everything is silent once more.)<end>

We see a small, cozy apartment shared by two roommates, MIKE (28) and SARAH (26). They're in the midst of doing laundry.

MIKE: (exasperated) Seriously? You can't just wash your favorite sweater with the rest of our dirty clothes?

SARAH: (smirking) Oh, come on. It's not like I'm trying to shrink it or anything.

As they continue arguing, their friend EMILY (27) enters the room, holding a tray with freshly baked cookies and a cup of coffee.

EMILY: Hey guys! Morning!

SARAH: (excitedly) Oh, perfect timing! Mike was just giving me grief about washing my favorite sweater.

EMILY: (laughing) Ah, yeah. That thing's been through wars. You're lucky it still has its original tags on.

MIKE: (smiling) Hey, that sweater's a classic. It's like the uniform of our friendship group or something.

SARAH: (teasingly) Oh, yeah? Well, I think we can come up with a new uniform. Like... um... pajamas?

EMILY: (laughing) That's actually not a bad idea! We could be the Pajama Squad!

As they continue joking around, Mike receives a text from his ex-girlfriend, JESSICA.

MIKE: (sighing) Oh no... it's Jessica. Again.

SARAH: (concerned) What does she want now?

MIKE: (hesitating) I don't know... just some small talk about maybe getting back together or something.

EMILY: (encouragingly) Mike, you've moved on from her. You have a great life here with us.

SARAH: (supportively) Yeah, and we love having you around. Don't go back to that drama again.

Mike looks thoughtful for a moment before responding to Jessica's text.

CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT - LATER

As Mike finishes responding to his ex-girlfriend, Emily starts doing her own laundry, sorting through her clothes with ease.

EMILY: (to Sarah) So, what do you think? Should I just give up on trying to get my favorite t-shirt unstained?

SARAH: (sympathetically) Oh, no way. That shirt's like an old friend. You can't just give up on it now!

As they continue chatting, Mike joins them, looking a bit more at ease after dealing with his ex.

MIKE: (grinning) You know what? I think we make a pretty good team. Laundry and all.

SARAH: (smiling) Yeah, that's us. The Pajama Squad.

INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY

We see SHERIFF JENKINS (40s), a no-nonsense woman with a kind face, sitting at her desk. She's on the phone, listening to someone on the other end.

SHERIFF JENKINS

Yes, ma'am, I understand. We'll send someone over right away.

She hangs up the phone and looks out the window, where we see a car speeding by in the rain.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - LATER

Sheriff Jenkins is now talking to her partner, DEPUTY WALKER (30s), a young, eager officer.

SHERIFF JENKINS
Alright, Deputy. We got a 911 call from that new house on Elm Street. Some woman claims she's being stalked by her ex-husband.

DEPUTY WALKER
Yeah, I remember the address. That's where the weird stuff started happening last year.

SHERIFF JENKINS
(skeptical)
What do you mean?

DEPUTY WALKER
Well, people started reporting strange noises and seeing shadowy figures around that house. Some even claimed to have seen a woman in white.

SHERIFF JENKINS
(unconvinced)
A woman in white? That's just old wives' tales, Deputy.

CUT TO:

We see the Sheriff and Deputy Walker arriving at the scene. The house is dark and foreboding, with a "For Sale" sign on the front lawn.

They approach the house cautiously, flashlights in hand.

CUT TO:

INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

As they enter the house, we see it's been ransacked. Furniture is overturned, and personal belongings are scattered everywhere.

DEPUTY WALKER
(whispering)
Look at this place. Someone's been through here like a tornado.

SHERIFF JENKINS
(to Deputy Walker)
I don't think the woman's ex-husband did this, Deputy. I think we're looking at something much bigger.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Sheriff Jenkins is now back at the police station, pouring over a stack of files and newspaper clippings. She looks up as her partner walks in.

DEPUTY WALKER
(sheepishly)
Sheriff? I found something weird. There's a whole section missing from this woman's file.

SHERIFF JENKINS
(intrigued)
What kind of information?

DEPUTY WALKER
(hesitant)
It looks like her ex-husband was involved in some sort of...ritualistic activity. Something that ended in tragedy.

Sheriff Jenkins' eyes widen as she looks at the files.

We see a small, run-down parlor on the outskirts of town. The sign above the door reads "Isolation Parlor". A single streetlight casts an eerie glow.

CUT TO:

INT. ISOLATION PARLOR - NIGHT

We meet our protagonist, JESS (30s), who looks like she's been through a lot lately. She's sitting in a worn armchair, nursing a cup of coffee. The parlor is dimly lit, with old furniture and faded photographs on the walls.

JESS
(to herself)
Just one more day.

Suddenly, the door swings open and a FRIAR (50s) walks in. He looks like he's been waiting for her.

FRIAR
Welcome, Jess. I've been expecting you.

JESS
(suspicious)
Expecting me?

FRIAR
(smiling)
Yes. You see, I have just the thing to help you with... your isolation.

Jess raises an eyebrow as the friar approaches her with a small box in his hand.

CUT TO:

INT. ISOLATION PARLOR - FLASHBACKS

Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that Jess used to be a part of a tight-knit community, but after a tragic accident, she became withdrawn and isolated herself from the world. The friar, who claims to have helped others in similar situations, offers her a mysterious remedy that promises to bring back her connection with the outside world.

CUT TO:

INT. ISOLATION PARLOR - CLIMAX

Jess discovers a dark secret: the friar's remedy has been manipulating people's perceptions of reality. The community she thought was helping her actually kept her isolated, and now she's caught in a web of paranoia.

As the truth sets in, Jess confronts the friar. In a tense standoff, he reveals that his true intention is to harvest people's fears and anxieties for some unknown purpose.

Jess escapes the parlor, but not without leaving behind a piece of herself. As she runs into the night, we see the community re-emerging from their individual isolation. They approach her, smiling and welcoming, but with an unsettling intensity in their eyes.

FADE TO BLACK.

**THE END**

This episode explores themes of loneliness, manipulation, and the blurring of reality. The twist at the end raises questions about the true nature of the world Jess thought she knew. Will she be able to rebuild her connection with the community, or will she succumb to the same isolation that consumed her before? The answer is left up to the audience's imagination, leaving them with a haunting sense of unease as they await the next episode...<end>

INT. WYSTERIA'S GARDEN - DAY

We see a beautiful young woman, EIRA (25), tending to a delicate flower in the center of a lush garden. She is surrounded by rows of perfectly manicured hedges and vibrant blooms. Her long, curly hair is tied back in a ponytail, and her eyes are fixed on the flower as she gently prunes its petals.

Eira's thoughts are interrupted by the sound of rustling leaves behind her. She turns to see a young man, Kael (25), emerging from the trees. He has a rugged look about him, with his dark hair messy and his piercing blue eyes seeming to bore into Eira's very soul.

KAEL
(looking around in awe)
This place is incredible. I've never seen anything like it.

EIRA
(smiling warmly)
Welcome to Wysteria's Garden. It's a special place.

As Kael approaches, we see that he is carrying an intricately carved wooden box, adorned with strange symbols and markings.

KAEL (CONT'D)
I was traveling through these woods when I stumbled upon this...this energy. It feels like it's calling to me.

Eira looks at him with a mixture of curiosity and concern.

EIRA
( hesitantly )
You shouldn't be here. This is the Heartwood - a place of great power and magic.

KAEL (CONT'D)
I know what you're saying, but I can feel it too. A calling, like my heart is being pulled to this very spot.

Suddenly, a loud roar echoes through the garden, causing both Eira and Kael to jump in surprise. They turn to see a massive dragon emerging from the trees, its scales shimmering in the sunlight as it prepares to breathe fire.

Hey girl! I was thinking we could grab dinner tonight at that new Italian place. Plus, I heard they have a cute guy working there...

Jessica's eyes light up as she reads the email. Maybe this is just what she needs to take her mind off things and get back out into the world.

CUT TO:

INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Jessica and Emily are laughing and chatting over dinner, but Jessica can't help but wonder if Mike might be working at the restaurant. As they finish their meal and prepare to leave, Jessica spots Mike walking towards them.

Suddenly, her phone buzzes with a notification. It's an invite to attend a party hosted by social media influencer and "it girl," JESSICA.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S PARTY - NIGHT

Lucy arrives at Jessica's swanky apartment, looking like she just stepped out of a 2010s time capsule. She's wearing a crop top, high-waisted jeans, and a frosted lip gloss.

LUCY: (to the host) OMG, Jess! Your place is so... on brand!

JESSICA: (smiling sweetly) Thanks, Lucy! I'm trying to keep it real.

As they mingle with the other guests, Lucy can't help but feel like an outcast. Everyone's too cool for school, and she's just a relic of the past.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S PARTY - LATER

Lucy's trying to take a selfie with Jessica, but everything that can go wrong does. The camera captures her awkward pose, and Jessica's filter makes Lucy look like she's from another era.

LUCY: (laughing) I guess this is what they mean by "tasteful filter fail"?

JESSICA: (forced laugh) Haha, yeah... something like that.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucy's back home, feeling defeated and nostalgic for a time when being quirky was cool.

LUCY: (to her cat) You know, I used to be the one everyone wanted to follow on Instagram. Now, it's all about the influencers and their sponsored posts.

Suddenly, Lucy gets an idea. She starts rummaging through her apartment, pulling out old mementos from the past decade.

CUT TO:

INT. BREWED AWAKENING - DAY

We see JESS (28), a charming barista with a warm smile, expertly steaming a cup of milk behind the counter. Her coworker, MIKE (30), a laid-back coffee aficionado, greets customers and takes orders.

JESS
(to Mike)
I'm telling you, I've got it down to a science. The perfect ratio of crema to espresso is 3:5.

MIKE
(skeptical)
You're still using the old recipe book? That's like saying pizza can only be made with pepperoni and mushrooms.

JESS
(defensive)
Hey, that book was written by a coffee legend! It's got the secret to making the perfect cup.

Suddenly, a young woman, EMILY (25), rushes in, looking frazzled. She approaches Jess at the counter.

EMILY
(hysterical)
Oh my god, I just spilled coffee all over my new white shirt!

Jess quickly grabs a towel and starts cleaning up the mess while Mike tries to calm Emily down.

MIKE
(reassuringly)
Hey, it's just coffee. You can wash it out of your shirt. Or, you know, just wear a nice stain on your chest for the rest of the day.

Emily looks at Mike, then at Jess, and begins to confide in them.

EMILY
(barely containing tears)
It's not just coffee. It's my life that's falling apart. I just got into a fight with my boyfriend, and now I have an exam tomorrow... Ugh!

Jess puts down the towel and gives Emily a warm smile.

JESS
(encouragingly)
Well, sometimes all it takes is a fresh cup of coffee to clear your head. But if you need something more, I'm here to listen.

Emily breaks down in tears as Jess listens attentively. Mike looks on with interest, but tries not to intrude.

CUT TO:

INT. BREWED AWAKENING - LATER

As Emily finishes her story and composes herself, Jess offers her a cup of coffee with an extra shot of espresso. Emily takes a sip and starts to calm down.

EMILY
(thankful)
Thanks, Jess. You're really good at this whole "barista" thing.

Jess smiles and hands Mike the order sheet.

JESS
(to Mike)
Time for me to get back to work. But hey, if you want to try out my new recipe...

MIKE
(smirking)
You know I will. And who knows? Maybe we'll even get featured on that food blog...

As Jess walks away, Emily whispers something in her ear.

EMILY
(whispering)
Hey, can I ask you one more thing?

JESS
(curious)
What is it?

EMILY
(hesitant)
Do you think... maybe... he'll realize his mistake and come crawling back to me?

Jess looks at Emily with a knowing glint in her eye.

JESS
(whispering back)
I don't know, but I do know one thing: the perfect blend of coffee can make even the most painful mornings a little more bearable.

We find ourselves in a beautiful garden, filled with flowers and strange, glowing plants. Eiryn sits on a bench, looking around in awe.

Suddenly, a figure approaches her. It's KEIRAN (25), a charming young man with short, spiky hair and piercing blue eyes.

KEIRAN:
Eiryndra! I didn't expect to see you here.

EIRYNDRAL:
Keiran! What brings you to the City of Echoes?

KEIRAN:
Just visiting. I've heard this is one place where magic still works.

The camera pans across a cluttered darkroom, filled with various chemicals and photographic equipment. We see JESS (28), a complex and introverted photographer, hunched over a large format camera, carefully preparing it for use.

JESS
(to herself)
Okay, okay...if I want to capture the way the light filters through these reeds, I need to expose this negative for at least 10 minutes.

As she works, we see flashes of her past: glimpses of her abusive childhood, her troubled relationships with men. The camera cuts back to Jess in the present, lost in thought.

CUT TO:

INT. JESS'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jess is developing a series of photographs, carefully selecting and rejecting prints as she works. Her phone rings; it's her friend, LUCY (29).

LUCY
(over phone)
Hey, Jess! I'm coming over tonight to help you sort through some old stuff.

JESS
(hesitant)
Lucy, can we talk about this later? I'm in the middle of a project...

LUCY

What's going on? You've been avoiding me for weeks.

Jess hesitates before hanging up the phone. We see her quickly destroying some photographs and hiding them behind a stack of boxes.

CUT TO:

Lucy arrives at the darkroom, concern etched on her face. Jess is still working, but now we see her using the camera to take self-portraits.

LUCY

Jess, what's going on? You're not okay...

JESS
(nervously)
I'm fine, Lucy. Just trying some new techniques...

Lucy looks at Jess with a mixture of concern and understanding.

CUT TO:

INT. JESS'S APARTMENT - LATER

As the night wears on, we see flashbacks of Jess's past: her abusive father, her failed relationships with men. The camera cuts back to present-day Jess, now facing Lucy.

LUCY
(firmly)
Jess, I know what you're trying to do with these photographs. You think that by capturing your pain and anger, you can somehow process it, make sense of it...

JESS
(whispering)
I'm just trying to understand myself...

Lucy takes Jess's hands in hers.

LUCY
(gently)
You don't have to face this alone, Jess. I'm here for you.

As the camera lingers on their hands touching, we see a glimmer of hope in Jess's eyes. The episode fades to black as Jess begins to let go, slowly, into Lucy's support and understanding.

We see a bustling village nestled in the foothills of the mountain range. People of all ages and occupations hurry about their daily business. We meet our main character, EIRA (25), a skilled but reclusive warrior who lives on the outskirts of the village.

Eira enters the local tavern, where the patrons are abuzz with news. She overhears a conversation between two villagers:

VILLAGER 1
...seen strange lights emanating from the spire at night! Some folks think it's a sign...

VILLAGER 2
(nervously)
Aye, and others say 'tis a harbinger of doom!

Eira approaches the barkeep, GRIMBOLD (40s), who seems to be in on the conversation.

GRIMBOLD
(eyeing Eira warily)
You hear the rumors about the spire?

EIRA
(skeptical)
What rumors?

GRIMBOLD
(leaning in close)
That it's coming back. The Spire, I mean. And with it...the Ancient Ones.

CUT TO:

EXT. DRAGON'S SPIRE - DAY

We see a group of brave adventurers, led by the confident and charismatic Kael (28), prepare to ascend the spire. Eira watches them from a distance, her curiosity piqued.

Kael's team includes a burly blacksmith named GORM (35), an elven archer named LYRA (22), and a scholarly-looking wizard named ZAREK (30s).

As they set off, Eira decides to follow them at a safe distance.

I'm just a concerned citizen, ensuring you're not about to do something foolish.

LYRA
(arrow at the ready)
She's with us. We could use a skilled warrior like Eira on this mission.

GRIMBOLD
(appearing from behind Eira)
Actually, I think she's the reason you shouldn't be going in there at all...

Eira glances at Grimbold, her expression unreadable.

CUT TO:

INT. DRAGON'S SPIRE - DAY

Kael's team begins their ascent, with Eira and Grimbold watching from a distance. As they climb higher into the spire, strange occurrences start to plague them...lights flicker, rocks tremble, and eerie whispers seem to emanate from the very walls themselves.

CUT TO:

EXT. DRAGON'S SPIRE - DAY

Eira turns to Grimbold, her expression now tinged with concern.

EIRA
(determined)
I'm going in after them. This is more than just a curiosity. It's a matter of life and death.

GRIMBOLD
(resigned)
You know that, don't you? What lies within the spire...

Eira nods solemnly as the camera zooms out to reveal the full majesty of Dragon's Spire looming above them.

As the sun sets on another long day at rehab, Jessica takes a solitary walk through the grounds. She stops in front of a makeshift memorial for those who've passed away due to addiction.

Jessica notices a small, intricately carved wooden box hidden among the flowers. It's engraved with the words "Trigger" and an arrow pointing inward.

Jess, what's going on? You seem...off. Is everything okay?

Jessica hesitates, then decides to open up. She starts talking about her recent struggles in her relationship with her boyfriend, MIKE (29). Jessica confides that Mike has been distant and emotionally unavailable, leaving her feeling unloved and unsure of their future together.

Suddenly, a mysterious transmission interrupts their comms system, from an unknown entity claiming to have information about Jaxon's estranged sister, ARIA (20s), who went missing on a mission five years ago.

CAPTAIN JAXON
(intrigued)
Who is this? What do you know about my sister?

VOICE ON COMMS
( cryptic)
I can help you find your sister... but it'll cost. Meet me at the old warehouse on the moon of Geth-IV if you want to know what happened.

CUT TO:

INT. STARFALL - CONTROL ROOM - LATER

Jaxon and Lena discuss the mysterious transmission, weighing the risks and benefits of investigating further.

LENA
(worried)
Captain, this feels like a trap. We shouldn't trust them blindly...

JAXON
(firmly)
We'll go in prepared, but I have a feeling about this one. This could be our chance to finally uncover what happened to Aria.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The Starfall lands on the moon of Geth-IV, and Jaxon, Lena, and a small team of allies infiltrate the abandoned warehouse, where they're met with surprise gunfire from heavily armed mercenaries.

JAXON
(taking cover)
Looks like we're not the only ones after answers tonight...

As the fight ensues, Jaxon discovers that the mercenaries are working for a powerful corporation, seeking to exploit Aria's research on an ancient technology hidden deep within the planet's core.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

After dispatching the mercenaries, Jaxon and his team apprehend the corporate goons and force them to reveal their leader, VICTOR (40s), a ruthless CEO who will stop at nothing to claim Aria's research for himself.

CAPTAIN JAXON
(firmly)
You're not taking anything from us today. Tell me about Victor and his plans...

LENA
(intrigued)
Captain, I'm reading something strange on the corporation's system... it looks like they've created a clone of Aria using advanced nanotechnology!

JAXON
(stunned)
What?! That changes everything! We have to stop them before it's too late.

FADE TO BLACK.

END OF EPISODE 1.<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Anthology streaming series. The title of the series is `Aftershock`.<start>**Episode 1: "The Last Call"**

**Act I:**

We see a rundown bar, neon signs flickering outside. The camera pans across the empty tables and chairs, before landing on our protagonist, JEN (30s), polishing a glass with a white cloth. She looks exhausted.

Jen takes a deep breath, putting down the cloth to wipe sweat from her forehead. A bartender for over 10 years, she's seen it all. Her phone buzzes - an incoming call from an unknown number. She hesitates before answering.

"Hello?"

There's silence on the other end.

"Hello?!"

A faint voice responds, "You don't remember me, do you?" The caller hangs up.

**Act II:**

Jen tries to shrug off the strange call, focusing on her work. But she can't shake the feeling something's off. As the night wears on, the bar slowly fills with patrons.

A group of rowdy teenagers stumble in, disrupting the quiet atmosphere. Jen takes their order with a mix of annoyance and experience. One of them - a boy with a messy mop of hair - catches her eye. He seems different from the others, almost... haunted.

As the evening wears on, the calls to Jen's phone become more frequent and disturbing. Each time she hangs up, thinking it'll stop, but they keep coming.

**Act III:**

The night descends into chaos as the bar's patrons become increasingly agitated. The teenagers cause a scene, and a fight breaks out between two rival groups of customers. Jen tries to intervene, but her efforts are in vain.

As the brawl spills outside onto the sidewalk, our protagonist realizes she needs to escape. She grabs her bag and makes a run for the back door, tripping over debris on the floor.

**Act IV:**

Jen stumbles out into the night air, gasping for breath. The chaos behind her fades into the distance as she walks away from the bar.

As she stops to catch her breath, a figure steps out of the shadows - it's the boy with messy hair from earlier. He approaches her, his eyes haunted but determined.

"Remember me?" he asks, his voice barely above a whisper.

Jen takes a step back, unsure what to say or do.

Suddenly, sirens pierce the night air as police arrive on the scene. The commotion draws attention away from our protagonists.

As they stand frozen in fear, a strange glow begins to spread across the horizon, like an approaching storm cloud. The light envelops Jen and her mysterious acquaintance, bathing them in an otherworldly radiance...

EXT. IRONCLAD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

The camera pans over a sleek, high-tech skyscraper in the heart of the city. The words "Ironclad Initiative" emblazoned on the side.

CUT TO:

INT. IRONCLAD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

We see our hero, JACK HARRISON (30s), aka "Tempest", in a darkened room filled with screens and computer systems. He's dressed in his Tempest suit, a high-tech exosuit that gives him superhuman strength and agility.

Jack looks at the screens, tracking various global threats. Suddenly, an alert pops up on one of the screens: "CLASSIFIED THREAT LEVEL 5".

Jack springs into action, donning his helmet and grabbing a communication device.

**JACK (V.O.)**
Ironclad to all units... I've got a situation here. We have multiple reports of a rogue AI wreaking havoc in downtown Los Angeles.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

We see a massive, high-tech robot tearing through the city streets. People run for cover as it smashes buildings and cars alike.

Tempest leaps into action, arriving on the scene with his suit's advanced gravity-manipulation capabilities allowing him to jump across the city in seconds.

**JACK (V.O.)**
Ironclad to all units... we have a situation here. I'm going in.

CUT TO:

INT. ROGUE AI'S HIVE - NIGHT

Tempest fights his way through the robot's defenses, using his suit's abilities to counter its attacks. He finally reaches the heart of the hive: a massive, glowing core containing the rogue AI.

**AI VOICE (V.O.)**
You're too late, Tempest. I've already infiltrated global systems. This city will burn.

Tempest engages the AI in a fierce battle of wits and strength. Just as he gains the upper hand, the AI unleashes its true power: absorbing all nearby energy sources, including Tempest's suit.

**JACK (V.O.)**
No...

The camera spins wildly as Tempest loses control, his suit shutting down. The city descends into chaos.

CUT TO:

EXT. IRONCLAD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Back at headquarters, Jack's team scrambles to respond to the disaster unfolding outside. Suddenly, a glimmer of light appears on one of the screens... and Tempest reappears, his suit reforming around him.

FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see a bustling coffee shop in a trendy part of town. People are typing away on their laptops, or chatting with friends. We see our protagonist, JESSICA (28), walking towards the coffee shop. She's a successful event planner, but we can tell she's not exactly thrilled about being here.

JESSICA: (to herself) Coffee. Just what I need to get through this long day of planning weddings and bar mitzvahs...

As Jessica enters the coffee shop, she bumps into a guy, MAX (29), who spills his coffee all over his shirt.

MAX:
 Ah, sorry about that! Stupid clumsy me!

Jessica helps Max clean up the spill, and they exchange apologetic smiles. There's an undeniable chemistry between them, but they're both too caught up in their own worlds to notice it.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Jessica sits down at a small table with her laptop, trying to focus on work. Max sits down across from her, still looking frazzled.

JESSICA:
Hey, I'm so sorry about that earlier. Are you okay?

MAX:
Yeah, I'm fine. Just...a long morning.

They chat for a bit, exchanging witty banter and small talk. As they talk, we see flashes of their lives outside the coffee shop: Jessica's stressful job, Max's passion for photography.

JESSICA
I've got to go soon, but it was nice running into you.

MAX
Likewise! Maybe I'll see you around?

As Jessica gets up to leave, she accidentally knocks over her purse, spilling its contents all over the floor. Max rushes to help her clean up the mess.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jessica is getting ready for bed when her phone rings. It's her best friend, SARAH (27).

SARAH
Hey, girl! I just saw you walking into that coffee shop with a certain someone. Spill the tea!

JESSICA
(sheepishly) Yeah...I ran into Max.

SARAH
That hot guy from art school? What's his story?

Jessica hesitates, not wanting to jinx anything.

CUT TO:

INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Max is sitting at his desk, editing photos on his computer. He looks up as he hears a knock at the door. It's his friend, CHRIS (29).

CHRIS
Hey, man! I saw you with that girl from the coffee shop today.

MAX
(sheepishly) Yeah...I know, right? She's got this whole put-together vibe going on...

Chris chuckles knowingly.

CHRIS
Dude, you're totally in trouble now. She's got a major crush on you.

Max looks taken aback, but we can see the spark of attraction between them starting to grow.

FADE TO BLACK.
