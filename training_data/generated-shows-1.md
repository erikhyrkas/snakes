CUT TO:

INT. SPACESHIP - MESS HALL - DAY

We see CAPTAIN JENKINS (40s), a seasoned space traveler with a no-nonsense attitude, sitting at a table sipping coffee with her trusted second-in-command, LIEUTENANT TOMLINSON (30s).

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(serious)
Tom, we're not going to make it. The navigation system is malfunctioning and we're off course.

LIEUTENANT TOMLINSON
(frustrated)
But captain, I've run the diagnostics a hundred times. We'll get there eventually.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
( grim)
Not if we don't change course now, we won't. This ship is not designed for deep space travel. We're playing with fire here.

Suddenly, the ship's alarm blares to life and the captain jumps up from her seat.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(into comms device)
What is it?

VOICE ON COMMS DEVICE (V.O.)
Captain, we're detecting an anomalous energy signature ahead. It's unlike anything in our database.

CUT TO:

EXT. SPACESHIP - DAY

The ship hurtles through the void as the captain and Tomlinson stand on the bridge, scanning the viewscreen with concern.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(whispering)
What if this energy signature is not of this universe?

LIEUTENANT TOMLINSON
(nervously)
Captain, we need to change course. Now.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(firmly)
Hold steady, Tom. We have to see what's on the other side of that anomaly.

As they continue to scan the viewscreen, a massive energy vortex erupts before them, causing the ship to shudder violently.

CUT TO:

EXT. SPACESHIP - VORTEX - DAY

The camera shows the ship being pulled into the heart of the vortex as stars and galaxies blur by in a dizzying whirlwind. The captain and Tomlinson cling to the viewscreen as their world is turned upside down.

CUT TO:

INT. SPACESHIP - CORRIDOR - DAY

The captain and Tomlinson stumble through the ship, disoriented and dazed from the intense energy vortex.

(calling out)
We need to find a way to stabilize the ship!

LIEUTENANT TOMLINSON
(terrified)
What's happening? Where are we?

CUT TO:

EXT. SPACESHIP - DAY

The camera shows the ship emerging from the energy vortex, battered and scarred but still intact.

CAPTAIN JENKINS

CUT TO:

INT. SUNNY SIDE UP - NIGHT

Jess slides into a booth and takes out her phone. She's met by the owner, Vinnie, an affable Italian-American man in his 50s.

Coffee, black.

Vinnie nods and pours Jess a cup as she scrolls through her phone.

Jess gets out of the diner and walks to her car, a sleek black sedan. She's on her way to meet with a potential client.

CUT TO:

INT. MARIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Maria, a frantic-looking woman in her 30s, opens the door to Jess. Maria ushers Jess into her apartment, where a plate of pasta sits uneaten on the kitchen counter.

MARIA
(pleading)
Oh God, you have to help me! They're after me!

JESS
( calm and detached)
Who's after you?

Maria glances around nervously before leaning in close.

MARIA
My sister, Sophia. She went missing five years ago. The cops said she was dead, but I know it wasn't true. And now...

Maria looks at Jess with a hint of desperation.

MARIA (CONT'D)
...now, the same people who took her are after me.

Jess scribbles some notes on her pad and nods thoughtfully.

CUT TO:

INT. JESS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jess paces around her office, phone pressed against her ear. She's talking to an old friend and former cop, TOM.

TOM (V.O)
I've got connections with the Red Hook PD, Jess. I can dig up some info for you.

JESS
( into phone)
That would be great, Tom. I need any information I can get on Sophia and her disappearance five years ago.

Tom's voice is reassuring as Jess hangs up the phone and turns to her computer.

CUT TO:

INT. RED HOOK PD - NIGHT

Jess arrives at the precinct and asks for Detective KELLY, a by-the-book detective in his 40s. Kelly looks Jess up and down before ushering her into his office.

DETECTIVE KELLY
(skeptical)
What do you want?

JESS
( unfazed)
I'm looking for information on Sophia LaRosa's disappearance five years ago.

Kelly leans back in his chair, eyes narrowing.

KELLY (CONT'D)
That's a closed case, Miss... ?

Jess smiles coldly as she hands him her card.

CUT TO:

EXT. RED HOOK - NIGHT

As Jess leaves the precinct, she takes a call from Tom on her phone.

TOM (V.O)
Jess, I dug up something interesting. Looks like Sophia might have been involved with some shady characters before she disappeared.

Jess's eyes narrow as she listens to Tom's voice on the other end of the line.

CUT TO:

INT. TEMPLE OF THE ANCIENTS - DAY

We see DR. SOPHIA PATEL (40s), an archaeologist with a look of wonder on her face, as she examines ancient artifacts. She's accompanied by her partner, JACK MURPHY (30s).

JACK
(whispering)
Sophia, this is incredible. The artifacts are from an era we thought was lost to time.

SOPHIA
(awed)
The symbols etched on these stones... it's the language of a long-lost civilization.

Suddenly, they hear a strange rumbling noise, like thunder in the distance. But there's no storm.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOST CITY - DAY

The camera shows us a sprawling metropolis, hidden deep within the jungle. Towering structures made of a glittering white stone seem to defy gravity, as if they're being supported by invisible columns.

CUT TO:

INT. TEMPLE OF THE ANCIENTS - DAY

Sophia and Jack find themselves face-to-face with an ancient text etched into the wall. The symbols begin to glow with a soft blue light.

SOPHIA
(whispering)
This is it... this is the prophecy we've been searching for.

JACK
(skeptical)
A prophecy? What does it say?

Sophia carefully translates the text, her eyes widening in amazement as she reads on.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOST CITY - DAY

As Sophia finishes translating, a group of shadowy figures emerges from the jungle, their faces obscured by masks.

SOPHIA
(alarmed)
We have to get out of here... now!

Jack nods, and together they make a frantic dash for the exit.

CUT TO:

INT. TEMPLE OF THE ANCIENTS - DAY

The temple begins to shake violently, as if it's being torn apart from within. The symbols on the walls blaze with an intense light, illuminating the figures in the shadows.

JACK

What's happening?!

Sophia grabs Jack's arm and pulls him toward the exit.

CUT TO:

The temple collapses behind them, sending dust and debris flying everywhere. They stumble through the chaos, finally emerging into bright sunlight.

INT. ASHOKA'S THRONE ROOM - DAY

King Ashoka (30s), a powerful and imposing figure, sits on his throne, surrounded by his advisors and courtiers. He listens intently as his chief advisor, CHANDASVA (40s), speaks to him in hushed tones.

CHANDASVA
Your Majesty, the situation in Kalinga grows more dire by the hour. The war with the Magadha Empire has reached a boiling point.

ASHOKA
(sternly)
What news of my brother, Vimala?

CHANDASVA
(pained expression)
I'm afraid he was killed in battle, sire. His army is in disarray...

Ashoka's face darkens, and for a moment, we see the toll this war has taken on him.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

We see the chaos of war unfolding before us: soldiers clashing, horses screaming, and bodies scattered across the ground. Ashoka rides into the fray, his battle-standard held high above his head.

CUT TO:

INT. ASHOKA'S THRONE ROOM - LATER

The room is empty, except for a young woman, KALI (20s), who stands before Ashoka's throne. She holds a small, intricately carved stone statue in her hand.

KALI
(hesitantly)
Your Majesty... I come bearing news of my own...

Ashoka looks at her with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

ASHOKA
( gesturing for her to speak)
Speak, girl. What is it that you bring me?

CUT TO:

EXT. PALATIAL GARDENS - LATER

Ashoka walks alone through the gardens, lost in thought. Kali appears beside him, holding out the stone statue.

KALI
(nervously)
I found this on the battlefield... I believe it's a token from my father...

Ashoka takes the statue and examines it. A look of recognition crosses his face.

ASHOKA
(whispering to himself)
This was my brother's seal...

CUT TO:

INT. ASHOKA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

The room is filled with advisors, courtiers, and soldiers, all gathered around Ashoka as he speaks from his throne.

No, I'm telling you, we need to move now. The timeline is unraveling...

Suddenly, the lab around her begins to distort and ripple, like the surface of water.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW EDEN - DAY (LATER)

Sophia stands in the middle of a deserted street, surrounded by ruins. She looks up at a massive, crystal-like structure that seems to be pulsing with energy.

MIKE (30s, wearing a worn-out "I'm with Stupid" t-shirt) plops down on the couch, holding a script.

MIKE
(to himself)
Okay, let's get this thing written...

Suddenly, his phone buzzes. He picks it up to reveal a text from his boss, JEN (40s, wearing a "Wack Pack Productions" lanyard).

JEN
Hey Mike! Just got word that we're getting a feature film deal... from someone who saw our YouTube channel.

MIKE

Oh my god, this is it! We made it!

INT. WACK PACK PRODUCTIONS - LATER

Mike's coworkers start to arrive for the big meeting.

There's KAREN (20s, with a messy bob and a penchant for making weird faces), who's always coming up with new, terrible ideas.

KAREN
I've got it! We're going to make a film about... a chicken in space!

And there's STEVE (40s, wearing a "I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right" expression), the resident grump and skeptic.

STEVE
(sarcastically)
Oh boy, because nothing says "box office smash" like a chicken in space...

The group gathers around Mike as he reads from the script. It's... not good.

MIKE
(nervously)
Okay, so the chicken is on a mission to save Earth from an alien invasion...

JEN
(excitedly)
And we're going to make it a musical!

KAREN
(ignoring Jen)
Can I play the chicken?

STEVE
(sighing)
I'll play the straight man... because that's exactly what this script needs.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET - DAY

The Wack Pack Productions team arrives on set, ready to film their big-budget feature film. Chaos ensues as they struggle to get the scene just right.

There are arguments over who gets to wear the chicken costume, and whether or not Karen's dance moves are "on brand."

STEVE
(exasperated)
This is a disaster.

MIKE
(calmly)
It'll be fine. We've got this.

KAREN
(defensively)
Hey, my dancing is great! You're just not used to seeing it on a 40-foot screen!

She finds an old CB radio on a shelf and begins to fiddle with it. Suddenly, she hears a faint voice coming from the speakers.

Jessica is painting a vibrant seascape, her brushstrokes bold and expressive. Her phone rings, breaking her concentration. She answers, and we see her expression change to one of concern.

Jessica rushes into the hospital, looking worried. She enters a room where we see her sister, EMILY (30), lying in bed, surrounded by machines and medical equipment. Emily's face is pale, but she smiles weakly when Jessica arrives.

EMILY
(weakly)
Hey, sis. Thanks for coming.

JESSICA
(concerned)
What happened? The doctor said you were doing okay...

EMILY
(pained)
I had an accident. I was surfing and got caught in a riptide. But it's just a concussion. I'll be fine.

Jessica looks relieved, but also guilty for not being there to support Emily earlier.

CUT TO:

EXT. COASTAL TOWN - DAY

As Jessica is leaving the hospital with Emily, they run into MIKE (32), a handsome and charming fisherman who has recently moved back to the town. Mike and Jessica exchange awkward pleasantries, but it's clear there's a spark between them.

MIKE
(smiling)
Hey, you're the artist, right? I've seen your work around town.

JESSICA
(laughing)
That's me! How did you know?

MIKE
(teasingly)
Small town, everyone knows each other's business. (he winks)

Jessica blushes, feeling a flutter in her chest.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S STUDIO - LATER

As Jessica continues to paint, she can't shake off the memory of Mike's charming smile. She starts to feel drawn to him, but also worried about getting involved with someone new while dealing with Emily's accident.

Jessica puts down her brush and begins to write in a journal, reflecting on her feelings.

JESSICA
(to herself)
What am I doing? I'm not even sure if I'm ready for this...

Jaxson stops in front of a security console and leans in close.

JAXSON

Vega? I need to talk to you.

The camera cuts to VEGA (20s), Jaxson's tech-savvy friend, who's hunched over a holographic interface. Vega looks up, concerned.

VEGA
(concerned)
Jax, what is it? You look like you've seen something.

JAXSON
(nervously)
I have. I had a vision...a dream. And I think I'm starting to remember something. Something that happened before the Nexus...

Vega's expression turns from concern to alarm.

VEGA

Jax, no. Don't talk about that stuff here. Not on the station...

Jaxson paces back and forth in his small living space, trying to process what's happening to him. Vega enters, carrying a tablet.

Listen, I've accessed some encrypted files for you. Information about your past...and something called "The Event".

As Vega hands Jaxson the tablet, he sees images of himself as a younger man, in a mysterious facility on a remote planet.

JAXSON

This is real, isn't it? The memories I had...they're not just dreams?

I'll take a look around.

As Jason begins to survey the crime scene, Kate hands him a photo of the victim.

Jason pours over evidence from the crime scene, trying to piece together what happened to Sophia. Kate calls to check in on his progress.

INT. JAIL - DAY

We see a sign on the wall that reads "Welcome to Sunnyville Jail". We hear the sound of inmates chatting and laughing in the background.

CUT TO:

A group of prisoners sitting in the common area, playing cards and talking. One of them, a tall, lanky man with a goofy grin, stands up.

JOHNNY (played by a comedic actor like Adam Devine)
Hey guys, I'm Johnny! The new guy!

The other inmates stare at him, unimpressed.

BOBBY (played by someone like Rob Riggle)
Oh great, another one. What's your crime?

JOHNNY
Uh, attempted robbery? No, wait, it was just a prank gone wrong... and then I got caught.

TOMMY (played by a character actor like Brian Posehn)
A prank gone wrong? That's not even a crime!

BOBBY
(sarcastically)
No, no, Johnny's an expert at getting arrested. He'll teach us all how to get in trouble without actually doing anything wrong.

The group of inmates laughs and teases Johnny.

CUT TO:

INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

Johnny is sitting on his bunk, looking dejected. Suddenly, there's a knock at the door.

SHERIFF (played by someone like Nick Offerman)
Hey, new guy! I heard you're quite the jokester.

JOHNNY
(sarcastically)
Oh boy, this should be good.

The Sheriff enters the cell and sits down next to Johnny.

SHERIFF
I've been watching you guys from the control room. You've got potential.

JOHNNY
(incredulous)
What? Me?

SHERIFF
Yeah! I want to turn your "joking offenders" club into a legitimate comedy troupe... with my supervision, of course.

Johnny looks excited but also terrified.

CUT TO:

INT. JAIL COMMON AREA - DAY

The inmates are gathered around the Sheriff and Johnny.

BOBBY
(skeptical)
Dude, you can't turn this place into a comedy club! We're in jail!

JOHNNY
(excitedly)
But think about it! It'll be like "Comedy Central" meets "Ozark"!

TOMMY
(teasingly)
Yeah, and they'll let us out early for good behavior... as long as we make them laugh.

The group of inmates laughs and teases each other.

CUT TO:

INT. JAIL CELL - LATER

Johnny is pacing back and forth in his cell, excitedly talking to himself.

JOHNNY
(to himself)
This could be it! The chance to turn our lives around... with comedy!

Suddenly, he stops pacing and looks up at the camera.

JOHNNY
(sarcastically)
Yeah, because nothing says "redemption" like a bunch of prisoners in orange jumpsuits trying to make each other laugh.

We see a small, picturesque town nestled between rolling hills and dense forests. The camera pans across the quaint streets, showing residents going about their daily business.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Detective JESSICA WALKER (35) sits at her desk, sipping coffee and staring at a photo of a young woman on her phone. Her partner, DETECTIVE MIKE HARRISON (40), enters the room.

MIKE
Hey, Jess. What's got you so deep in thought?

JESSICA
(hesitating)
Just going over some case files from when I was with the Seattle PD.

MIKE
(skeptical)
You're not thinking of leaving us, are you? We just got used to having you around.

Jessica gives Mike a wry smile.

JESSICA
No, nothing like that. Just...old habits die hard, I guess.

Mike nods understandingly and they begin discussing their current case: the disappearance of 17-year-old SARAH JENKINS.

CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheriff TOM HARRIS (50), Mike's father, is speaking with a local resident, MRS. GIBBS (60).

TOM
...and we're doing everything we can to find Sarah.

MRS. GIBBS
(concerned)
You'll find her, Sheriff. This town looks out for its own.

The camera lingers on Mrs. Gibbs's face as she speaks, and we notice a hint of something unsettling in her tone.

CUT TO:

EXT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

Jessica is shown walking through the department's parking lot when she notices a small, discreetly parked car with tinted windows.

JESSICA
(to Mike)
Hey, what's that car doing here?

MIKE
(looking around)
I have no idea.

Jessica approaches the car and notices it has a "Visitor" pass on the windshield. She takes out her phone to snap a photo of the license plate number when...

CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Mike walks into his father's office, followed by Jessica.

MIKE
Dad, we need to talk about this car in the parking lot.

TOM
(surprised)
Oh? What about it?

JESSICA
(pulling up the photo on her phone)
It doesn't belong here. And look at the plate number...it's registered to a company called "Redstone Security".

Tom looks uneasy, and Mike seems confused.

MIKE
Dad, what do you know about Redstone Security?

TOM
(stammering)
Uh, just that they're a consulting firm...nothing more.

Jessica raises an eyebrow.

JESSICA

Save it for the interview, Sheriff. We'll get to the bottom of this.

CUT TO:

INT. ADEL'S RED KEEP - DAY

Lord Arinthal, a battle-hardened warrior with an unyielding gaze, stands atop the fortress's ramparts, surveying the devastation below.

ARINTHAL:
(to his lieutenant)
This city is as good as lost. The enemy's superior numbers have us penned in. We'll not last another fortnight without relief from the outside world.

His lieutenant, a brooding figure with an air of desperation, nods grimly.

LIEUTENANT
(sarcastically)
Oh, I'm sure the gods themselves will see fit to send our salvation. After all, we've been praying for rescue for years now...

Suddenly, a gusty wind sweeps through the keep's halls, extinguishing torches and plunging the fortress into darkness.

CUT TO:

EXT. SIEGE LINES - DAY

Outside the city walls, an army of twisted, mutated soldiers - their bodies grotesquely distorted from dark magic - continue their relentless onslaught against Adel's defenses. They are led by a figure clad in tattered black armor, eyes blazing with malevolent intent.

CUT TO:

INT. ADEL'S RED KEEP - NIGHT

In the dead of night, as the sounds of war rage on outside, Lord Arinthal convenes an emergency council within his fortress. The city's nobles and clergy are summoned to discuss a desperate plan: to send their last remaining champion, Lyra - a skilled warrior with a penchant for darkness - into the fray against their enemies.

LYRA:
(skeptical)
You want me to fight alongside these... creatures? They're no better than beasts. What could possibly make them think twice about destroying this city?

ARINTHAL
(sternly)
They are not what they were, Lyra. I've seen it with my own eyes: some of the siege line's soldiers possess... something more.

The camera lingers on a hooded figure in the shadows, whose gaze seems to follow Lyra like a whispered threat.

CUT TO:

EXT. SIEGE LINES - NIGHT

Amidst the chaos and screams of war-torn Adel, Lyra stands at the edge of the battlefield, readying herself for her fateful confrontation with their twisted foes.

The camera pans up to reveal the dark figure from the council chamber watching from the shadows - an air of calculation, even admiration, upon his face.

As Lyra readies for battle, the sky above darkens further still. An eerie glow begins to build on the horizon...

The camera pans over a serene suburban street, before zooming in on a modest two-story house with a "For Sale by Owner" sign in the front yard.

Narrator (Voiceover): "Welcome to Oakwood Hills, where everyone knows each other's business. But sometimes, the truth can be deadly."

Cut to:

**INT. POLICE STATION - DAY**

Detective JENNY TAYLOR, a no-nonsense woman in her mid-40s with a sharp mind and piercing gaze, sits at her desk, sipping coffee.

Jenny (to her partner): "Another case of 'I didn't do it' and 'You're just harassing me.' You think this one's going to be a cakewalk?"

Partner, Detective TOM HARRIS: "Actually, Jenny, this one might be different. The victim was Emily Wilson, a 35-year-old wife and mother who had her share of enemies."

Jenny: "Enemies? What kind of enemies?"

Tom: "Well, rumor has it she was having an affair with the husband of her best friend... and he's got a history of violence."

Cut to:

**INT. WILSON HOUSE - DAY**

The police search the house, taking notes and collecting evidence.

Jenny (to Tom): "So, let's get this straight. The wife's dead, and the 'husband' was having an affair with his friend's wife... but his alibi checks out."

Tom: "That's right. He says he was at a business conference in LA when Emily died. We need to verify that."

Jenny: "And what about the best friend? What's her story?"

Tom: "Her name is Sarah Johnson. She's been cooperative, but I got the feeling she's hiding something."

**Act II:**

Cut to:

**INT. SARAH JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY**

Sarah, a petite woman in her mid-30s with a tight smile, answers the door.

Jenny (to Tom): "You think Sarah knows more than she's letting on?"

Tom: "I do. And I think we need to push her."

Sarah: "What are you doing here? You already talked to me yesterday."

Jenny: "We're just following up on some new leads, Sarah. Can we come in for a minute?"

As the detectives enter, they notice a faint bruise above Sarah's left eyebrow.

Tom (whispering): "Look at that bruise. She's got a story to tell, all right."

**Act III:**

Cut to:

**INT. EMILY WILSON'S JOURNAL - DAY**

Jenny discovers Emily's journal while searching her house.

( Voiceover ) Jenny reads from the journal:

"'I'm trapped in this marriage. I feel suffocated by my husband's lies and infidelity... I've been planning an escape for months, but it won't be easy...'"

Jenny (to Tom): "This changes everything."

Tom: "What do you mean?"

Jenny: "Emily wasn't who we thought she was. She had secrets of her own."

Cut to:

**EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY**

As the sun sets, Jenny turns to Tom with a determined look.

Jenny: "We've just begun to scratch the surface of this case. Get me more on Emily's husband and his alibi."

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

We meet JEN (35), a harried and overwhelmed wife, trying to fix a leaky pipe with her husband MIKE's (38) help.

MIKE
(frustrated)
This is ridiculous. We've been meaning to get this fixed for years.

JEN
(exasperated)
I know, I know. But we've got so much on our plate right now.

Suddenly, a loud CRACKING sound echoes through the house.

CUT TO:

EXT. 1424 MAPLE STREET - DAY

The family's son, TYLER (16), is outside playing basketball with his friends. He looks up to see his mom and dad rushing out of the front door, looking frantic.

TYLER
(concerned)
What's going on?

JEN
(panicked)
The house! It's... it's cracking!

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Jen and Mike try to assess the situation, they realize that a significant crack has formed in one of the walls.

MIKE
(calmly)
Okay, let's not panic. We'll get someone out here to look at it.

JEN
(fearful)
But what if...what if it's worse than we think?

CUT TO:

EXT. 1424 MAPLE STREET - DAY

As the family tries to process this new development, we see a flashback of Jen and Mike's perfect suburban life: their son playing sports, their daughter performing in school plays, them hosting dinner parties...

The camera pans out, showing that beneath the surface of their idyllic facade lies a complex web of secrets, desires, and fears.

Act II:

As the family deals with the aftermath of the crack, we see glimpses of their individual struggles:

* Tyler's struggling to cope with his parents' impending divorce.
* Jen's trying to hold everything together, despite her own feelings of despair.
* Mike's battling his own demons: a failing business and an affair that threatens to destroy their marriage.

As tensions rise and the family's world begins to unravel, we realize that the crack in the wall is just a symptom of a larger problem - the crumbling foundations of their relationships and their very way of life.

FADE TO BLACK.

Act III:

The episode ends with Jen standing alone in the living room, staring at the cracked wall. She takes a deep breath, and for a moment, we see a glimmer of hope in her eyes.

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a sprawling cityscape before zooming in on a small, rundown diner on the outskirts of town. We see JESS (28), a worn-out waitress with a perpetual scowl, expertly flipping pancakes behind the counter.

As Jess takes an order from a gruff old man, we meet our protagonist, LUCAS (30), who saunters into the diner, looking every bit the lost soul he is. He orders coffee and sits at the counter, eyeing Jess with a mixture of curiosity and desperation.

Jess tries to ignore Lucas, but their mutual disinterest only fuels his persistence. They engage in small talk, exchanging pleasantries that feel forced and rehearsed.

**Act II:**

As the diner fills with an assortment of eccentric characters – a chatty old lady, a pair of rowdy teenagers, and a haggard businessman on his lunch break – Lucas begins to open up to Jess. He shares tales of his failed relationships, his lackluster job prospects, and his all-consuming desire for freedom.

Jess listens intently, her expression softening ever so slightly as she relates to Lucas's sense of hopelessness. Despite their differences, they form a tenuous bond, united by their collective disillusionment with life.

As the lunch rush subsides, Lucas reveals he's planning to leave town – and possibly even leave his past behind. Jess, sensing an opportunity for escape herself, begins to ponder joining him on his journey.

**Act III:**

The diner closes, and the patrons disperse. Lucas and Jess engage in a charged conversation, their words hanging heavy with unspoken meaning.

As night falls, they step outside into the crisp evening air. The city stretches out before them like a vast, twinkling expanse of possibility.

Lucas takes Jess's hand, his eyes shining with an unshakeable optimism. For a moment, it seems as though anything can happen – that together, they might just defy gravity and soar.

The camera lingers on their entwined hands as the city lights blur around them, creating an illusion of weightlessness. It's a fleeting glimpse into a world where freedom is within reach... if only for a little while longer.

**Closing shot:**

As Lucas and Jess disappear into the night, the diner re-emerges from the shadows – a faded sign creaking in the wind. The camera lingers on the "Open" sign, its flickering neon light an apt metaphor for the terminal velocity of our dreams.

Okay, T-Bone, what's the play?

T-BONE

T-BONE
(shrugging)
Some guy's body, apparently. Looks like he was tossed onto the floor from up high.

Suddenly, the sheet is pulled back to reveal a young man in his mid-20s, dressed in a suit and tie. He's been beaten badly and has several visible injuries.

JENNY

We're looking for information about one of your employees. His name was...

James "Jimmy" Lee. He used to work in security.

VALENTINE
(suddenly serious)
Oh, you mean Jimmy? Yes...yes, I knew him. He's been gone since last night.

JENNY
(raising an eyebrow)
Gone?

VALENTINE
(nervously)
Yes. I'm afraid he didn't show up for his shift this morning. Must have gotten himself lost in the city or something.

T-BONE
(skeptical)
You think Jimmy Lee just decided to take a vacation without telling anyone? That's not exactly what I'd call a "gut instinct".

VALENTINE

Look, detectives. I'm sure you'll find out everything you need to know about Jimmy and the events of last night. But for now...let's just say we're all very concerned.

Blackjack orders a whiskey at the bar as Georgy eyes him warily. Lucy, a beautiful young woman in her early 20s with long, curly brown hair, looks on with interest.

I've got news for you boys: I'm not lookin' to get mixed up in no man's game. I'm just tryin' to find this Flynn fella and collect a debt.

The cowboys exchange skeptical glances before nodding, seeming to accept Blackjack's story.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED MINE SHAFT - DAY

Blackjack navigates the dusty mine shaft on horseback, searching for any sign of Billy Flynn. As he rounds a corner, he finds a makeshift camp set up amidst the rocks.

BLACKJACK:
(approaching cautiously)
Flynn? That you?

Billy Flynn (played by actor MARC FORREST) emerges from behind a boulder, a rifle at his side.

BILLY FLYNN:
(sneering)
And who might you be?

BLACKJACK:
(smiling coldly)
You know exactly who I am. And I'm here to collect.

Flynn eyes Blackjack warily as the tension between them builds.

FADE TO BLACK.

Thanks, Dad. I'm just trying to keep everyone happy.

Jack, I've been getting reports about a string of burglaries in Rainier. Your tavern has been hit twice already this month. We need to figure out who's behind these break-ins.

JACK
(nervously)
I had no idea. I thought we were just experiencing a bad streak of... unfortunate events.

JENNY
(skeptical)
Unfortunate events? Come on, Jack. You know something. I can see it in your eyes.

Jack hesitates before speaking up.

JACK
(calmly)
Okay, fine. There was one guy who came in here a few weeks ago. He was tall, about six foot two, with short dark hair and a scar above his left eyebrow. He looked out of place but seemed friendly enough.

CUT TO:

INT. RANSOM'S TAVERN - NIGHT

EMILY
(to her sister, LUCINDA)
I swear, Lucinda, I'm suffocating under this gilded cage of societal expectations. Can't you see? They're all just pretending to be something they're not.

LUCINDA (22)
Emily, please. You know the rules. As a Wynton, we have a certain...reputation to uphold.

Reputation? You mean our family's history of marrying well and playing the part of perfect society ladies?

The evening has come full circle. The charity gala has ended, but for Emily, the real ball has just begun. She stands outside with Max, looking out at the city they both call home.

EMILY
(whispering)
What if I told you that I want more? More than this life? More than what's expected of me?

MAX
(surprised and intrigued)
You're talking about running away?

EMILY
(determined)
Not just from the city, but from all the things that have been holding me back. From being trapped in a cage of our own making.

The camera pans out as Emily and Max share a knowing look - they've crossed a threshold from which there's no turning back. The gilded cage may have seemed solid up until now, but it's about to get a whole lot more interesting.
