EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

We see a large, sprawling house on the outskirts of town. It's been years since we've seen it in disrepair.

CUT TO:

INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The room is cluttered and worn down from time. A young woman, JESSICA (28), sits huddled on a couch, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. Her mother, CAROL (55), stands opposite her, arms crossed.

CAROL
( firm but sad )
Jessica, you can't stay here. It's not safe for you or the kids.

JESSICA
(defensive)
What are you talking about? This is our home.

CAROL
(sighs)
It was your father's dream, not mine. And now that he's gone... (she glances around the room) it's just a reminder of everything we lost.

Jessica's face falls as she realizes the truth. Her father died in a car accident six months ago. The weight of his absence still lingers in the air.

CUT TO:

INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Jessica's two children, EMILY (10) and JASON (12), sit at the kitchen table, eating cereal. Emily looks up at her mother with pleading eyes.

EMILY
(whispering)
Mommy, can we go see Grandma? She said she'd take care of us.

JESSICA
(hesitates, then nods)
Okay, sweetie. I'll call Grandma and we'll talk about it later.

Jessica's phone rings and she quickly answers, her voice hushed as she speaks to... someone on the other end.

Jessica stands outside, looking out at the backyard where her children are playing with their grandfather, GEORGE (60). She takes a deep breath and heads back inside to face whatever is eating away at her.

CUT TO:

INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Jessica enters, she sees Carol sitting on the couch, holding a folder full of papers. Jessica's eyes widen as she realizes what's in there.

CAROL
( firm but with love )
Jessica, I've been doing some research and... (she takes a deep breath) it looks like your father didn't die in that car accident six months ago...

JESSICA
(stunned)
What are you talking about? Of course he did.

CAROL
(hesitates, then nods)
No, sweetie. He faked his own death. There's evidence to suggest... (she glances around the room, ensuring they're alone) ...he might still be alive.

Jessica's face turns white as she tries to process this revelation.

KHADIJA
(to her brother, ABBAS)
Father says we'll be here for only a week. We must make the most of it.

ABBAS
(skeptical)
You know Father will try to find you another husband while we're here. You need to keep your wits about you.

Khadija's expression turns serious as she looks out at the crowded streets.

We see Khadija's mother, AZIZA, expertly weaving a beautiful silk fabric as she talks to her daughter.

AZIZA
(smiling)
You know, child, I used to travel with your father on the Silk Road when we were young. The stories he'd tell me about the places and people... they ignited something within me.

KHADIJA
(laughing)
And what became of that spark?

AZIZA
(sadly)
It was extinguished when I had you, my dear. But your father always encouraged me to keep exploring, even if it's just through stories and memories.

Khadija looks at her mother with a deep affection.

KHADIJA
(smiling)
I'll carry on that legacy, Mother. I promise.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAMARKAND - DAY

We see Khadija walking through the bustling marketplaces of Samarkand, taking in the sights and sounds of the thriving trade center. She stops at a stall where a charming merchant, JAFAR (30), is selling exquisite silk fabrics.

JAFAR
(smirking)
Ah, welcome to my humble abode. I have just the thing for you, lovely lady.

Khadija eyes sparkle as she examines the beautiful fabrics on display.

KHADIJA
(laughing)
You're a charmer, aren't you?

JAFAR
(charmingly)
Only when it comes to finding the perfect silk for my customers. What do you think of this one? It's said to be from the finest looms in China.

Khadija's eyes light up as she touches the fabric with reverence.

KHADIJA
(awed)
This is exquisite! I must have it for my mother.

JAFAR
(smiling)
Ah, your mother, then. Well, let me see what else we can find...

As Jafar shows Khadija more fabrics, they engage in witty banter and lively conversation, their connection growing with every passing moment.

As they move to leave, Jack bursts in, taking down several mercenaries with ease.

JACK
(to Victor)
I'm afraid you're not going anywhere, Victor.

Victor sneers at Jack.

VICTOR
(sneering)
You think you can take on me and my team? We've got the upper hand here.

Jack smiles, unfazed.

JACK
(grinning)
Not when I've got Nova watching our backs.

Suddenly, a high-tech drone appears above the factory, hovering over the mercenaries.

We see Nova's face on a computer screen as she monitors the situation from her secret headquarters.

The final showdown takes place between Jack and Victor. They exchange blows, but ultimately, Jack gains the upper hand, defeating Victor with a swift kick.

Victor, you're not even worth the Shadow Agency's time.

As Jack stands victorious, we see a figure watching from the shadows - a woman named LILA, who looks eerily familiar to Jack.

Nova's face appears on the computer screen once more.

NOVA

Tyler rolls his eyes good-naturedly.

TYLER: Yeah, yeah... I know. But can you do me a favor? Help me brainstorm some ideas to get more young people involved?

Jessica grins mischievously.

Jessica and Tyler huddle together at the craft table, surrounded by their colleagues. They're all throwing around ideas and laughing.

(The camera pans over a lush, green jungle landscape as we hear the sound of drums beating in the distance.)

Narrator (Voiceover): In the heart of Southeast Asia, where the mighty Mekong River flows, lies the forgotten kingdom of Angkor. A place of ancient secrets and hidden treasures, waiting to be unearthed.

(The camera follows a young Khmer prince, Jayavarman II, as he makes his way through the jungle, surrounded by his loyal guards.)

Jayavarman II: (to his advisor) Our people are suffering, Lord Neng. The droughts and famine have decimated our crops. We must find a way to bring water and prosperity back to our kingdom.

Lord Neng: (wise and aged) Ah, Prince Jayavarman, the gods themselves have forsaken us. But perhaps...there is one who can guide us towards salvation.

(Jayavarman II nods, intrigued.)

**Act II:**

(The camera cuts to a group of Cham monks, led by the enigmatic and powerful High Priest, Javan.)

High Priest Javan: (to Jayavarman II) I sense that you are not merely a prince, but a leader chosen by the gods themselves. Come, let us speak in private.

(Jayavarman II and Lord Neng follow the monks to a secluded temple deep within the jungle.)

High Priest Javan: (whispering) The ancient arts of magic and diplomacy can help restore our kingdom's fortunes...but at a price, one that only the gods themselves may dictate.

Jayavarman II: (hesitant but determined) I will do whatever it takes to save my people. What must we do?

High Priest Javan: (eyes glinting with knowledge) The ancient Temple of Preah Pisnulok holds secrets and treasures beyond your wildest imagination...but first, you must prove yourself worthy.

(Jayavarman II nods resolutely, ready for the challenge ahead.)

(The camera shows Jayavarman II and his guards approaching the mysterious temple. As they draw near, a group of fierce warriors emerges from the jungle, armed to the teeth.)

Warlord Kambu: (sneering) Ah, Prince Jayavarman...or should I say...the would-be usurper? You think you can reclaim our rightful place on the throne?

Jayavarman II: (undaunted) We come in peace...and seeking wisdom. Leave us be and we will not harm you.

Warlord Kambu: (sneering) Wisdom? Ha! The only thing you'll find here is death!

(The camera shows a fierce battle between Jayavarman's guards and Warlord Kambu's warriors, with the outcome hanging precariously in the balance.)

(As the dust settles, Jayavarman II stands victorious but battered. He approaches High Priest Javan, who awaits him at the temple entrance.)

High Priest Javan: (impressed) Well done, Prince Jayavarman. You have proven your courage and strength. Now...are you ready to face the trials of the ancient Temple of Preah Pisnulok?

Jayavarman II: (eager) I am prepared.

Spark, you're not just a superhero, you're our best hope for saving humanity from the impending energy crisis.

JESSICA

What makes you think I'm the one to save the day?

EIRA
Korvah! I've come to hear your words!

KORVAH

You should not have come here, child. The Reckoning... it's not safe...

EIRA
What do you mean? I'm searching for answers.

KORVAH

Behold! This is the Oracle of the Ancients. It shows me visions of what lies ahead. And this one...

Eira takes the orb and sees a dark figure looming over the land.

THORGRIM
You shouldn't be asking so many questions, young one. The Reckoning is a bad business.

ELRIC

And what of my sister, Aria? I've come seeking her, not to be swayed by the whims of politics.

LYRA

Aria's fate is sealed. Her sacrifice will restore balance to our world. You must choose: join me in this new endeavor or forever bear the weight of what could have been.

Elric looks up at Queen Lyra, his expression unreadable. Suddenly, a commotion erupts outside the palace gates. People are rushing towards the throne room, frightened whispers spreading like wildfire.

I've come to speak on behalf of those you've forsaken. The working class, denied their rights and resources for too long. We will not be silenced or ignored.

LYRA
(firmly)
You will leave now. This is a matter between the crown and Elric.

ZAREK
(smiling)
Ah, but it's more than that, isn't it? It's about power and what we're willing to sacrifice for its sake.

The crowd murmurs in agreement, sensing an uprising. Queen Lyra raises her hand, signaling the guards to stand down.

We see Jessica walking down a street, looking stressed and distracted as she scrolls through her phone. She collides with MAX (32), a handsome but rough-around-the-edges man who is carrying a large box.

Jessica: Oh no, I'm so sorry!

Max: No worries, I'm the one who should be apologizing. You look like you've got more on your mind than just walking down the street.

Jessica: Yeah...just work stuff. What's in the box?

Sarah: You need to focus on your love life. Remember what happened last time we went out together? You came home early, looking like a hot mess.

Jessica: (laughs) Yeah...I remember. But that was ages ago!

Sarah: (whispers) See, Jess? Told you it was just what you needed!

The episode ends with a shot of Jessica walking home alone, feeling hopeful and excited about the unexpected encounter that has changed everything for her.

EXT. ABANDONED ASYLUM - NIGHT

The camera pans over the crumbling walls and broken windows of an abandoned asylum, the once-majestic building now a testament to neglect and decay.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED ASYLUM - NIGHT

We see JEN (28), a determined and resourceful young woman, making her way through the dark and dusty corridors. She carries a flashlight and a small backpack, her eyes scanning the space with a mixture of caution and curiosity.

Jen stops in front of a door marked "Ward 13". The sign creaks in the wind, and she hesitates for a moment before pushing it open.

INT. WARD 13 - NIGHT

The room is a maze of narrow beds and rusty medical equipment. In the center of the space stands an old hospital bed, surrounded by scattered papers and broken machinery. Jen approaches the bed, her eyes locked on something on the wall opposite.

Suddenly, she hears a faint whispering in her ear. "Get out while you still can."

Jen spins around, but there's no one there. She looks around nervously, feeling a shiver run down her spine.

CUT TO:

INT. JEN'S FLAT - DAY

We see Jen sitting on the couch, staring at a newspaper clipping in her hand. The headline reads "Local Asylum to Be Demolished". Below it is a photo of herself, taken years ago when she was a patient at that very asylum.

Jen looks up, lost in thought, as we hear the sound of her phone ringing. It's her friend and former nurse, SARAH (32).

SARAH
(over the phone)
Hey, Jen. I know you're still researching the asylum. But trust me, it's not worth it. There are some things that are better left alone.

JEN
(into the phone)
You don't understand, Sarah. This is about my sister, Emily. She died in Ward 13 when we were kids. And I'm convinced there was something... unnatural about her death.

SARAH
(over the phone)
I'm not sure you should be poking around in this, Jen. It's a bad idea.

Jen looks up at the camera with a resolute expression.

FADE OUT.

FADE OUT.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED ASYLUM - NIGHT

Jen confronts Emily in Ward 13. But as she tries to talk to her sister, it becomes clear that Emily is not what she seems. She's changed, twisted by some dark force within the asylum.

As they argue, we see flashes of their past, of the abuse and neglect Jen suffered at the hands of the very people who ran this asylum. The camera spins out of control, reflecting the chaos in Jen's mind.

Suddenly, Emily disappears into thin air, leaving Jen shaken and confused.

FADE OUT.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED ASYLUM - NIGHT

Jen emerges from the asylum, looking more determined than ever. As she walks away from the crumbling building, we see the camera follow her. But as it pans out further, we realize that this isn't just about Jen. This is about a whole system of secrets and lies.

Jack is driving through the streets of New Orleans, looking at the map in front of him. He's headed to a small bar on the outskirts of town.

Jack walks into the bar, looking around at the patrons. He spots a woman, SARAH (30s), sitting alone at the end of the bar. She looks up and sees Jack approaching.

SARAH
(whispering)
You must be Jack McGuire.

JACK
(sitting down next to her)
That's me. What can I do for you?

SARAH
(tearfully)
My sister, Emily... she was murdered last night. The police say it was a robbery gone wrong, but I know that's not true.

JACK

SARAH
(leaning in close)
Emily was investigating something before she died. She told me about it just the other day. And then... and then she was dead.

CUT TO:

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jack is interviewing Sarah, asking her questions about Emily's investigation.

JACK

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S CAR - NIGHT

Jack is driving through the streets of New Orleans again, this time with Sarah riding shotgun.

(serious)
This is a note from Emily. It says... (he clears his throat) 'Look into the Redemptor case'.

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jack and Sarah are sitting in Jack's office, looking over some papers. Jack is on the phone with someone.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jack and Sarah are sneaking into an abandoned warehouse, looking for clues.

JACE
(whispering to himself)
Dry Gulch. The last place I wanted to be.

As Jace rides into town, the camera follows him through the dusty main street. We see a few rough-looking men standing outside the local saloon, eyeing Jace with suspicion.

JACE
(to one of the men)
Mind if I tie up my horse here?

MAN 1
(sneering)
You can't just leave your horse tied up out here. That's my property.

JACE
(calmly)
I'm payin' for a drink inside, friend. You don't need to worry about my horse.

The man scowls but steps aside, allowing Jace to tie up his horse and enter the saloon.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

Jace enters the dimly lit saloon, scanning the room for a familiar face. He spots SARAH (20s), a beautiful young woman with piercing green eyes, sitting at a table by the window. She catches his eye and smiles, but Jace looks away, his expression guarded.

SARAH
(to the bartender)
Give me another whiskey, Joe. And make it quick.

JAC E
(to Sarah)
You look like you could use some company.

SARAH
(softly)
I'm doin' just fine, thanks for askin'.

Jace hesitates, then takes a seat across from her.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - LATER

As Jace and Sarah talk, we see flashes of their pasts: Jace fighting in the Civil War, Sarah running away from an abusive husband. The camera cuts back to them in the present, where they're growing closer.

JACE
(serious)
You can't stay here, Sarah. It's not safe for you.

SARAH

I know. I just...I don't have anywhere else to go.

CUT TO:

EXT. DRY GULCH - LATER

As night falls, Jace and Sarah are walking out of town together. Suddenly, they hear the sound of gunfire echoing through the desert. A group of rough-lookin' men emerge from the darkness, led by a scar-faced outlaw named HECTOR.

HECTOR
(sneering)
Well, well, well. Look what we got here.

JACE
(firmly)
You boys just passing through?

HECTOR
(laughing)
We're lookin' for someone. A man with a price on his head. You might know him, cowboy.

Jack arrives at the clock tower, a towering structure in the middle of the city. He sees a figure, SARAH (30s), waiting for him.

Thank God you're here, Jack. I've been sent to retrieve you.

JACK

I'm with a new organization. One that wants to make things right for people like you.

Jack eyes her warily.

CUT TO:

INT. CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT

Sarah reveals that Jack's former handler, ROGERS (50s), has been using him as a pawn in a larger game. Rogers wanted to use Jack's skills to infiltrate and sabotage various countries' governments.

We're here to put an end to it. We have proof of Rogers' crimes, and we need your help to take him down.

Jack is torn between his loyalty to Rogers and his desire for redemption.

Dad used me too. I'm the reason you were pulled back in, Jack.

We're inside Maeve's Tavern, where a group of locals are huddled around the bar, talking in hushed tones. The camera pans across the room, showing a mix of regulars and newcomers.

JENNY (28), a determined-looking detective with a sharp jawline, is standing at the edge of the room, surveying the scene. She's been investigating a string of unsolved murders in the area for weeks.

Suddenly, the door bursts open and SHERIFF TOM O'CONNOR (50s) enters, flanked by two burly deputies.

SHERIFF
(to Jenny)
We got another body, Detective. Male victim, early twenties. Looks like he was strangled to death.

JENNY
(nodding)
Get me the details, Sheriff. I want to know where this happened and what witnesses we have.

The Sheriff nods and turns to leave, but not before catching Jenny's eye.

SHERIFF

You be careful with this one, Detective. This is getting personal.

JENNY

I'll do my job, Sheriff.

We're at the scene of the latest murder: a dark alleyway behind an abandoned warehouse. The police are cordoning off the area and collecting evidence.

As Jenny examines the body, her eyes land on something that makes her pause. A piece of paper is clutched in the victim's hand, with some scribbled notes:

"...the truth...it's all about the fracture point..."

Jenny looks up at one of her team members, detective MIKE HARRIS (30s), a cocky and street-smart cop.

MIKE
(whispering)
You think this is connected to the other murders?

JENNY
(hesitant)
I don't know what it means yet, but I do know we're looking at something big here. This "fracture point" might be more than just a phrase.

CUT TO:

INT. JENNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jenny is pouring over the case files and notes from the crime scene, trying to make sense of the fragmented clues. Mike enters, holding a stack of papers.

MIKE

I managed to get some background on our victim, Detective. His name was Alex, and he had some connections with a local gang.

JENNY
(skeptical)
A gang? How does this fit into the bigger picture?

MIKE
(hesitant)
From what I can tell, this gang might be linked to an even bigger conspiracy...

Suddenly, Jenny's phone rings. It's her boss, Captain Lee (40s).

Jenny, we got a breakthrough on the other case files. There's evidence that our suspect is hiding in plain sight.

JENNY

JESSIE
What brings you to Red Rock, stranger?

JACK
Just passing through. I'm looking for a place to rest my horse and get some information on a... situation that's been botherin' me.

Jessie raises an eyebrow as Jack orders a whiskey from the bartender.

INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

Jack meets with the town sheriff, TOM (50s), who fills him in on the recent troubles plaguing Red Rock. A notorious outlaw named BUDDY ROBINSON has been terrorizing the townspeople, and Tom's men are unable to stop him.

JACK
(frowning)
That don't sound like Buddy Robinson I knew.

(grinning)
That's just peachy.

The camera zooms in on Jason's determined face as he readies his gun for the final confrontation.

INT. CASTLE DRAGON'S BANE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

King Arin, a middle-aged man with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, sits on his throne, looking troubled. His wife, Queen Lirien, stands beside him, her face etched with concern.

KING ARIN
(frustrated)
I don't care about the politics of it all, Lirien. Our daughter, Aethera, is still missing after three days. We need to do something.

QUEEN LIRIEN
(calmly)
We'll find her, Arin. I promise you that.

Suddenly, a commotion erupts outside as the castle's guards rush in.

GUARD 1
(panicked)
Your Majesty! The dark sorcerer, Malakar, has been spotted on the outskirts of the kingdom!

KING ARIN
(springing into action)
Summon the Royal Guard. We'll prepare to defend ourselves against this...this evil.

CUT TO:

EXT. DRAGON'S BANE - DAY

Aethera, a young woman with long, curly brown hair and piercing green eyes, runs through the forest, her feet pounding against the earth. She's being pursued by a group of armed men.

ATHERA
(desperate)
No! You'll never take me alive!

The camera follows Aethera as she leaps over rocks and dodges low-hanging branches, finally reaching a small clearing where she stops to catch her breath.

ATHERA
(whispering to herself)
How did Malakar's men find me so quickly? I was supposed to be safe...

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the trees. It's Kael, Aethera's childhood friend and one of the most skilled warriors in the kingdom.

KAEL
(smiling)
Aeth! What are you doing out here?

ATHERA
(relieved)
I was trying to escape. Malakar's men are after me!

KAEL
(grimly)
We need to get you back to the castle. Now.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE DRAGON'S BANE - THRONE ROOM - LATER

Kael and Aethera stand before King Arin, who looks relieved but also angry.

KING ARIN
(fuming)
What happened? How did Malakar's men find you?

ATHERA
(hesitantly)
I...I was trying to escape. I wanted to get away from all of this...

KAEL
(protectively)
Your Majesty, Aethera didn't betray us. She was just trying to protect herself.

KING ARIN
(skeptical)
Protect herself? From what?

ATHERA
(tearfully)
From my own destiny...I have a feeling that I'm not who everyone thinks I am...

CUT TO:

EXT. DRAGON'S BANE - DAY

As Aethera speaks, the camera pans out to reveal a hidden passage behind her, and a mysterious figure watching from the shadows.

We see JACK "BLACKJACK" McCARTHY (40s), a rugged and weathered man with a scar above his left eyebrow, walk into the local saloon. Blackjack is accompanied by two tough-looking men, JOE and TOM. The patrons of the saloon stare at Blackjack in a mix of awe and fear.

BLACKJACK
(to Joe and Tom)
Alright boys, we're here for the money. We've got a score to settle with the banker.

JOE
(nodding)
And with the sheriff too, I reckon.

TOM
(whispering)
Yeah, but don't let him get his hands on that cash.

The bartender, a gruff-looking man named JASPER, looks at Blackjack with a mixture of hatred and respect.

JASPER
(to the patrons)
Well, well. Looks like Blackj... um, Mr. McCarthy has returned to Red Rock.

BLACKJACK
(smirking)
That's me. And I'm back for good this time.

CUT TO:

EXT. RED ROCK - DAY

As Blackjack and his men make their way through town, they're met with hostility from the townsfolk. The sheriff, a stern-looking man named JEB, steps out of his office to confront Blackjack.

JEB
(firmly)
Blackjack McCarty, you've been wanted for years. I've got a price on your head.

BLACKJACK
(smirking)
You think a little thing like the law can keep me from getting what's mine?

The tension between Blackjack and Jeb is palpable as they engage in a verbal sparring match.

CUT TO:

INT. BANK - DAY

Blackjack and his men storm into the bank, where they confront the banker, MR. HENRY. The scene erupts into chaos as Blackjack demands the cash from the teller's drawer.

BLACKJACK
(to Henry)
Now, now. Let's not make a scene in front of all these fine folks.

HANK
(backing away)
Okay, okay! Take it!

As Blackjack's men scoop up the money, Jeb and his deputies arrive at the bank to apprehend them.

CUT TO:

INT. LOST CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

We meet our protagonist, DR. EMILY WARD (35), a determined and compassionate psychologist who specializes in working with children who have experienced trauma.

Dr. Ward sits across from 8-year-old JESSICA, who is staring blankly ahead, her eyes vacant. Jessica's mother, CAROLYN, sits beside her, holding her hand.

DR. WARD
(concerned)
Jessica, can you tell me what happened to you? You've been having some very disturbing nightmares lately.

JESSICA
(hesitates)
I... I don't remember.

CAROLYN
(nervously)
It's okay, sweetie. It's going to be alright.

Dr. Ward exchanges a concerned glance with Carolyn.

We see a dilapidated cabin nestled deep within the woods. The camera lingers on the cabin as we hear a faint whispering in the wind, almost imperceptible.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. WARD'S OFFICE - LATER

Dr. Ward sits at her desk, reviewing Jessica's case files. Her colleague and friend, DETECTIVE JASON "JAX" JACKSON (40), enters the office, looking grave.

DETECTIVE JACKSON
(serious)
Emily, I think you need to hear this. We've got a situation out in these woods. A little girl went missing yesterday afternoon. We're still searching for her.

DR. WARD
(concerned)
What's the situation?

DETECTIVE JACKSON
(somberly)
She was playing near an old cabin on the outskirts of town when she vanished. No signs of foul play, but... there are some pretty weird reports coming in from witnesses who claim to have seen things moving around that cabin.

Dr. Ward's expression darkens as she realizes a connection between the missing girl and Jessica's nightmares.

DR. WARD
(intently)
Jax, I think I can help you find this little girl.

DETECTIVE JACKSON
(nodding)
Let's get to work then.

CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - DAY

Dr. Ward and Detective Jackson arrive at the cabin, surrounded by an eerie silence. As they approach the entrance, they notice something strange: a series of seemingly random symbols etched into the doorframe.

DETECTIVE JACKSON
(confused)
What's this? Looks like some kind of code.

DR. WARD
(calmly)
No, Jax. I think it's more than that.

Dr. Ward reaches out and touches one of the symbols. Suddenly, the camera lingers on her hand as a vision begins to form before our eyes...

EXT. ABANDONED MINE - DAY

We see an old, abandoned mine on the outskirts of a small town. The camera pans across the entrance, showing two figures approaching.

CUT TO:

JAX (35), a rugged and charismatic ex-special forces operative, and LENA (28), a brilliant and feisty engineer, making their way towards the mine entrance.

LENA
(looking around cautiously)
Alright, let's move. We don't have much time before they realize we're here.

JAX
(checking his watch)
We've got 30 minutes before the extraction team arrives.

Lena hands Jax a pair of gloves and goggles.

LENA
(distributing equipment)
Put these on. It's not going to be pretty in there.

As they put on their gear, we hear a rumble coming from inside the mine.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED MINE - DAY

Jax and Lena make their way deeper into the mine, following a narrow tunnel. The ground beneath them begins to shake, and dust starts to fall from the ceiling.

LENA
(grabbing Jax's arm)
What is this?

JAX
(looking around frantically)
We need to get out of here, now!

Suddenly, a massive explosion rocks the mine, sending rocks and debris crashing down around them. Lena is caught beneath a pile-up, while Jax manages to grab her hand.

LENA
(panicked)
Get me out! Get me out!

JAX
(grunting with effort)
Hold on!

With a Herculean effort, Jax lifts the rubble off Lena and pulls her to safety.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED MINE - LATER

As they catch their breath, Lena begins to examine her equipment.

LENA
(examining the wreckage of an advanced surveillance device)
This is what we've been searching for. A revolutionary new comms system that could change the face of global espionage.

JAX
(looking around cautiously)
But it's not going anywhere without us.

Suddenly, they hear footsteps coming from deeper in the mine.

LENA
(grabbing Jax's arm)
The extraction team must have arrived early.

CUT TO:

With the mercs defeated, Jax and Lena emerge from the mine, ready to make their escape.

JAX
(glancing around)
Time to get out of here before more reinforcements arrive.

LENA
(hacking into a nearby satellite phone)
I've got the extraction team on their way. We just need to hold on for 10 more minutes.

As they wait, we see a massive convoy of black SUVs arriving at the outskirts of town, carrying even more heavily armed mercenaries.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED MINE - LATER

Jax and Lena are met with a surprise - an old flame of Jax's, SOPHIE (32), emerges from one of the SUVs.

SOPHIE
(smirking)
Looks like you're in a bit of a spot, Jax.

JAX
(confused)
Sophie? What are you doing here?

SOPHIE
(smiling sweetly)
Just here to help. You know how that is.

As they exchange words, Lena looks on suspiciously, sensing something is off.
