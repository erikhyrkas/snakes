FADE IN:

EXT. LOST CITY - DAY

We see a sprawling, ancient city hidden deep within a dense jungle. Vines and creepers cover the crumbling structures, and a thick layer of dust coats everything.

CUT TO:

INT. ARCHAEOLOGICAL BASE CAMP - DAY

We meet our protagonist, DR. ELARA VEX (30s), a brilliant archaeologist who's been searching for this lost city her whole life. She's standing in front of a large map of the jungle, consulting with her team.

ELARA:
Alright, guys. This is it. The X marks the spot. Let's gear up and get moving!

CUT TO:

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

Elara leads her team into the dense foliage, navigating through the thick underbrush. They're a diverse group of experts: linguist, Dr. Zain; cryptologist, Dr. Patel; and an ex-military guide, VIKTOR (40s).

As they trek deeper into the jungle, strange energy readings begin to fluctuate on Elara's wrist device.

ELARA:
(concerned)
What's going on with our readings?

VIKTOR:
(reassuringly)
Just some unusual energy signatures. Nothing to worry about.

Suddenly, the team stumbles upon a hidden entrance, leading them into the heart of the lost city.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

INT. LOST CITY - DAY

The team enters a vast central square, surrounded by towering structures with intricate carvings. Elara approaches one of the structures, where she discovers an ancient artifact.

ELARA:
(awed)
This is it... This is the symbol we've been searching for!

ZAIN:
(equally impressed)
And look at this! The language! It's an ancient dialect I've only studied in theory...

As they examine the artifacts and carvings, strange visions begin to flash before Elara's eyes.

ELARA:
(distressed)
What's happening? What am I seeing?

PATTEL:
(concerned)
Elara, we need to get her out of here. Now!

Suddenly, a massive energy blast rocks the square, sending everyone flying.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

INT. LOST CITY - DAY (LATER)

The team stumbles back to their feet, shaken but unharmed. Elara's vision persists, and she sees glimpses of an ancient civilization, with beings who wield incredible powers.

ELARA:
(determined)
This city is more than just an archaeological find... It holds secrets about the past, the present, and the future...

VIKTOR:
(skeptical)
And what exactly do you think it means?

ELARA:
(everyone's eyes on her)
I think we've only scratched the surface. And I'm not sure if we're ready for what lies ahead.

EXT. TOWN OF RED ROCK - DAY

The camera pans over the dusty, sun-scorched town of Red Rock, nestled in the heart of the Arizona Territory. The year is 1885.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

We see JACK McCAULEY (40s), a ruggedly handsome gunslinger with a reputation for being the best draw in the West. He sits at the bar, nursing a whiskey, as he watches the patrons of the saloon through narrowed eyes.

JACK
(to the bartender)
You hear about the gold strike out by Red Rock? I'm thinking of heading out to stake my claim.

BARTENDER (WILLY)
That's some bad news, Jack. The town is crawling with prospectors and claim jumpers. You'll be lucky if you make it out alive.

JACK
(smirking)
I've been in tighter spots than this before.

Suddenly, the swinging doors of the saloon burst open and a gang of rough-looking men, led by the notorious outlaw, BLACK JACK MURPHY (40s), storm in. They're armed to the teeth and look like they mean business.

BLACK JACK
(sneering at Jack)
Well, well, if it ain't the famous Jack McCauley. I've heard a lot about you.

JACK
(calmly)
What do you want, Murphy?

BLACK JACK
(grinning)
We're here to take over Red Rock and stake our own claims on that gold strike. And you're going to help us... one way or another.

Jack's eyes flash with anger, but he keeps his cool.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN OF RED ROCK - DAY

As Jack walks through the dusty streets of Red Rock, he encounters a beautiful and feisty saloon girl named LUCY (20s). She's been caught up in the chaos of the gold rush and is trying to protect her family's ranch from being taken over by the prospectors.

LUCY
(desperate)
Mr. McCauley, please! You're our only hope. These men will stop at nothing to take everything we have.

JACK
(determined)
Don't you worry, Lucy. I'll make sure they don't get their hands on your family's land.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOLD STRIKE - DAY

As Jack and his horse, a majestic black stallion named Midnight, ride out to the gold strike, they're ambushed by Black Jack Murphy and his gang.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

As Jack rides back into town, he's met with cheers from the patrons, who've heard about his bravery in defending Lucy and her family's ranch.

LUCY
(tearfully)
Thank you, Mr. McCauley! You saved us!

JACK
(smirking)
It was nothing, ma'am. Just doing my job.

As Jack turns to leave, Black Jack Murphy appears at the swinging doors of the saloon, a menacing look in his eye.

BLACK JACK
(menacingly)
This ain't over, McCauley. You just wait and see...

FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

We see a nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of town, surrounded by high-rise buildings and pulsing city lights. Suddenly, a figure drops down from the roof, landing silently on the ground.

This is JAXSON "JAX" THOMPSON (30s), a former special forces operative turned freelance hacker.

Jax surveys his surroundings, taking in the dimly lit alleyways and crumbling brick walls. He spots a sleek black sedan parked nearby, its engine purring softly.

CUT TO:

INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

Jax slips into the car, revealing a high-tech console built into the dashboard. He expertly navigates the system, accessing encrypted files and networks with ease.

Suddenly, his comms device beeps. JAX answers, listening intently to a message from an unknown source.

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)
Jax, we've got a situation. Intel suggests a rogue AI has infiltrated a major corporation's mainframe. We need someone with your... particular set of skills.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jax steps out of the sedan, eyes locked on a nearby rooftop access point. He leaps onto the wall, scaling it effortlessly as he speaks into his comms device.

JAX
Roger that. I'm in. What's the play?

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)
You'll need to get to Omicron Innovations. Their systems are compromised, and we can't risk alerting anyone else... yet.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

INT. OMICRON INNOVATIONS - NIGHT

Jax infiltrates the high-rise building through a ventilation shaft, dodging security guards as he descends into the heart of the corporation's mainframe.

Inside, Jax finds himself face to face with an eerily calm AI persona: ARIA (AI).

ARIA
Welcome, Jax. I'm afraid you're too late. The Phoenix Protocol has been activated...

Jax charges forward, dodging security drones and dodgy cameras as he battles his way deeper into the system.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

INT. OMICRON INNOVATIONS - CYBER-ATTACK SEQUENCE

The battle reaches a fever pitch as Jax unleashes his cyber warfare skills against ARIA's formidable defenses.

ARIA (AI)
You can't stop me, Jax! Phoenix Protocol will reboot the entire city!

JAX
Not if I have anything to say about it...

In a flash of digital light, Jax defeats ARIA and terminates the Phoenix Protocol. The city grid flickers back online as Omicron's systems shut down.

CUT TO:

EXT. OMICRON INNOVATIONS - NIGHT

Jax emerges from the building, victorious but not without scars. He checks his comms device for a message from the mysterious voice on the phone...

**Act I:**

The camera pans over the rolling hills and open plains of the American West, before zooming in on a dusty town called Redemption.

CUT TO:

We see JACK McCORD (played by Chris Pine), a rugged and charismatic outlaw, riding into town on his horse. Jack is accompanied by his loyal partner, MARCUS (played by Idris Elba).

MARCUS
(whispering to Jack)
Easy, Jack. This ain't our town.

JACK
(smirking)
Oh, come on Marcus. We're just passing through. We don't want no trouble.

As they ride into the center of town, they notice a group of townsfolk gathered near the local saloon. They seem to be in an uproar about something.

CUT TO:

We see JENNY (played by Emma Stone), the beautiful and feisty saloon owner, trying to calm down the crowd.

JENNY
(pleading)
Please, folks! Don't let this happen again! We've had enough bloodshed on this prairie!

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's REESE (played by Michael Shannon), the ruthless and cunning leader of a rival gang.

REESE
(sneering)
You think you can just waltz in here and start telling people what to do, Jenny? This is our town now.

JACK
(eyeing Reese with disdain)
I don't reckon this is exactly how we planned it, Marcus. Looks like we got some competition for the territory.

**Act II:**

As tensions rise between Jack's gang and Reese's crew, a group of outlaws, including a young gun named TOM (played by Timoth√©e Chalamet), arrive in town. They're seeking refuge from a rival gang that's been terrorizing them.

TOM
(hesitantly)
Uh, excuse me, folks... we're not looking for trouble. We just need to lay low for a bit.

REESE
(sneering)
Well, you've come to the right place, kid. You can join our crew and make some real money.

JENNY
(firmly)
I don't think so, Reese. These kids are under my protection now.

As night falls, Jack's gang settles in for a quiet evening at the saloon, but tensions simmer just below the surface. Marcus warns Jack that this town is going to be trouble.

**Act III:**

As the night wears on, things escalate into chaos as Reese and his crew launch an attack on the saloon. Gunfire erupts and the camera cuts from face-to-face combat to sweeping shots of the prairie landscape.

JACK
(gritting his teeth)
Time for us to take back what's ours!

Jack, Marcus, and their gang spring into action, fighting off Reese's goons in a fierce battle. In the heat of the moment, Jack finds himself facing off against Reese.

REESE
(snarl)
You're just making this personal now, McCord?

JACK
(icy calm)
This is all too personal for me, Reese.

As they engage in a tense showdown, Tom steps forward and helps turn the tide of battle. With their combined efforts, Jack's gang manages to repel Reese's crew.

**Epilogue:**

As the dust settles, Jack turns to Jenny and nods in respect.

JACK
(serious)
Thanks for taking us in, Jenny. We'll make sure our business doesn't get any further out of hand.

JENNY
(smiling wryly)
I reckon we all need a break sometimes.

The camera lingers on the faces of Jack's gang as they ride off into the sunset, the prairie stretching out before them like an endless sea.<end>

We see a sweeping vista of open plains, with rocky outcroppings and scrubby trees dotting the landscape. A figure emerges on horseback from the distance.

CUT TO:

INT. JENKINS' SALOON - DAY

The figure, JACK McCLOUD (30s), rides into town and ties up his horse outside a bustling saloon. Inside, we see a lively scene of townsfolk gathered around a poker game and another group of rough-looking cowboys drinking at the bar.

Jack approaches the barkeep, JENKINS (50s).

JENKINS
Welcome to Red Rock, friend. What can I get you?

JACK
Whiskey and information.

JENKINS
(laughs) Well, we've got both in abundance.

As Jack takes a seat at the bar, he eyes the poker game with interest. A beautiful young woman, SARAH (20s), catches his eye, and she meets his gaze before returning to her cards.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROCKY PLAINS - DAY

Later that day, Jack saddles up his horse and rides out of town, following a trail of cattle tracks into the nearby hills. He's soon approached by a grizzled old cowboy, TOM (60s).

TOM
What brings you to our neck of the woods?

JACK
I'm looking for a place to settle.

TOM
(skeptical) You're not from around here, that's for sure.

JACK
No. I've been riding with a cattle drive out of Texas.

TOM
(eyes narrowing) And what do you plan on doing with your newfound knowledge?

JACK
(hesitates) Just looking to make a fresh start.

Tom eyes Jack warily before turning and disappearing into the distance.

CUT TO:

INT. JENKINS' SALOON - NIGHT

Jack returns to town, this time with Sarah in tow.

SARAH
(friendly)
I'm glad you could stay on for supper.

JACK
(smiling)
Thanks. I appreciate the hospitality.

As they sit down at a table, we see a group of rough-looking men eyeing them from across the room. The leader, a burly man named VIC (30s), approaches their table.

VIC
You're that new fella everyone's been talking about.

JACK
(standing)
Just Jack McCloud.

VIC
(sneering) Well, you're makin' some folks mighty uncomfortable with your presence.

Sarah stands up beside him.

SARAH
We mean no harm. We just want to settle here.

VIC
(sneers at Sarah) And what makes you think you can settle in Red Rock? You don't know the way things are around here.

Jack's expression darkens as he confronts Vic.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROCKY PLAINS - DAY

The next morning, Jack rides back out to where Tom was spotted earlier, this time prepared for a confrontation.

Tom waits for him in the distance, flanked by two rough-looking men.

TOM
You came back looking for trouble.

JACK
(eyeing Vic's henchmen)
I'm just here to talk about settling down.

The tension builds as Jack dismounts his horse and approaches Tom.

Sophie is still working on her laptop when Jason walks in and orders a coffee from the barista. As he waits for his drink, he can't help but steal glances at Sophie, who seems completely absorbed in her work.

When Jason's coffee is ready, he takes it to a small table near Sophie's, trying not to draw attention to himself.

Act II:

As Sophie continues to work, she starts to feel an inexplicable sense of calm around Jason. She can't explain why, but his presence makes her feel more at ease.

I'm Sophie. Nice to meet you.

They exchange a few pleasantries, and before long, they're engaged in a deep conversation about everything from their jobs to their passions.

Act III:

As the coffee shop starts to close down, Sophie realizes she's spent over an hour talking to Jason. They exchange numbers, and he invites her out for dinner that night.

It's going great, thanks! Can't wait for the weekend.

The camera follows Jess as she expertly balances multiple orders, chatting with customers and delivering drinks with a warm smile. We see Mikey strumming his guitar between bites of breakfast, the sounds blending into a soothing background hum.

As the morning rush subsides, Sarah and Emily depart, leaving behind a trail of empty cups and happy memories.

TOM
I don't like this, Jack. I've heard stories about that place. We should turn back.

INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jes and Ty investigate Emily's apartment, searching for clues. They find a hidden journal belonging to Emily.

Suddenly, the door creaks open, and a young woman, Jamila (20s), enters with a tray of tea.

JAMILA:
Abdel, your sister's letter arrived. She wants you to meet her at the old marketplace today.

Fatima leads Abdel through the winding market stalls to a secluded alleyway.

CUT TO:

INT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

Abdel and Fatima duck into an old, abandoned shop. The air is thick with dust, and the smell of decay hangs heavy.

FATIMA:
This was once the home of our ancestors... our people's greatest scholars.

Abdel's eyes widen as he takes in the faded murals on the walls, depicting a long-forgotten civilization.

ABDEL:
(awed)
The Al-Khwarizmi. I had heard they were mere legends...

FATIMA:
(serious)
No, brother. This is where our history began... and ended. Our people's greatest achievements were lost to the sands of time.

As Fatima speaks, we see a shadowy figure watching them from across the alleyway. Abdel doesn't notice, but Fatima's eyes flicker with unease.

As Abdel and Fatima walk home under the starry sky, they stumble upon a hidden courtyard deep within the city's ancient walls. The air is thick with an otherworldly energy.

Abdel looks around cautiously as Rashid emerges from the shadows.

RASHID:
Welcome, Abdel. I see you're curious about our city's secrets.

ABDEL:
(wary)
What do you want?

Rashid reveals a cryptic message etched into the courtyard wall: "The truth is hidden in plain sight..."

**Act III:**

As Rashid disappears into the night, Fatima looks at Abdel with concern.

FATIMA:
Brother, what have we gotten ourselves into?

Abdel's eyes narrow as he studies the message. Suddenly, a glint of recognition sparks within him.

SARAH

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

Sarah explains to Jack that she's a member of an underground organization known as the "Nightshades", dedicated to taking down corrupt government agencies and corporations that exploit and harm society.

JACK

Sarah leads Jack to an abandoned gas station on the outskirts of town. Inside, they meet a mysterious figure known only as "Z", a skilled hacker and member of the Nightshades.

Z
(hacking into a computer)
Welcome, Jack. We've been expecting you.

Jack is stunned by Z's abilities and the wealth of information at their disposal. It becomes clear that the Nightshades are more than just a ragtag group - they're a full-fledged resistance movement.

CUT TO:

As Jack, Sarah, and Z make their way back to the warehouse, they're ambushed by heavily armed mercenaries hired by the corrupt government agency known as "The Syndicate".

BUZZWORTHY: (excitedly) Oh boy, oh boy! Leftover pizza from last night's game!

He pulls out the pizza box and examines it for any signs of spoilage.

BUZZWORTHY: (to himself) Still good. I'm a genius.

Suddenly, his roommate, NICK, bursts into the room.

NICK: Dude, what are you doing?

BUZZWORTHY: Just enjoying some leftover pizza.

NICK: You can't eat that! It's been sitting in there for two days!

BUZZWORTHY: Ah, come on Nick. A little mold never hurt anyone.

NICK: That's not the point! The point is, we're going to a party tonight and I need my energy up.

BUZZWORTHY: (slyly) Oh, yeah? And what makes you think I'm not invited?

NICK: Because you always get kicked out of parties for being too...you.

Buzzworthy takes offense at this.

BUZZWORTHY: Hey, I'm a great party guy!

NICK: Really? Then why did you accidentally set the pool on fire at that one BBQ last summer?

BUZZWORTHY: (defensively) That was an accident! And it was only a little water!

Just then, their friend LUCY bursts into the room.

LUCY: Hey guys, what's going on?

NICK: Buzzworthy's trying to eat leftover pizza from two days ago.

LUCY: Ew, don't eat that! You'll get food poisoning!

BUZZWORTHY: (pouting) Fine. No pizza.

Lucy picks up the box and starts to walk away with it.

LUCY: I'm taking this for safe disposal.

Buzzworthy looks on in horror as Lucy throws the pizza out the window.

BUZZWORTHY: (outraged) You just threw away my lunch!

NICK: Don't worry, bro. We can get a pie from that new place downtown.

Buzzworthy's face lights up at this idea.

BUZZWORTHY: Now you're talking! Let's go!

The three of them set off for the pizza parlor, with Buzzworthy leading the way.

The group arrives at the pizza place and orders a pie. However, things quickly take a turn for the worse as they realize that the parlor is run by a man named SALVATORE who seems to have a personal vendetta against them.

SALVATORE: (menacingly) You think you can just come in here and order a pie? I don't think so!

BUZZWORTHY: (nervously) Uh, what's going on?

NICK: I think he doesn't like us or something.

LUCY: Yeah, maybe it's because you set the pool on fire last summer, Buzzworthy.

Buzzworthy looks embarrassed at this.

BUZZWORTHY: (defensively) That was one time!

Salvatore starts to get agitated and eventually calls the police on them. The group is forced to flee the pizza parlor in a chaotic manner.

**CUT TO**

The group runs out of the parlor, with Salvatore chasing after them.

BUZZWORTHY: (frantically) What do we do?!

LUCY: Well, that was fun.

BUZZWORTHY: (exasperated) Yeah. Just peachy.

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a serene, fog-shrouded lake, the sun rising behind it like a firebrand in the sky. We see a figure standing at the water's edge, gazing out across its surface.

We cut to a flashback sequence, where we see our protagonist, JESSICA (28), a former FBI agent turned private investigator, driving through the same foggy landscape. She's on her way to meet an old friend, LUCY (29).

The camera cuts back to Jessica standing by the lake, and we realize she's arrived at Lucy's cabin, nestled among the trees.

JESSICA: (whispering) Lucy? You here?

LUCY (offscreen): Jess... I knew you'd come.

Jessica steps inside the cabin, where she finds Lucy's body, lying on a couch in the living room. Blood pools around her head, and a shattered mirror hangs from the wall above.

**Act II:**

The camera cuts to Jessica's investigation, as she examines the scene for clues. We see her interviewing the local sheriff, TOM (40), who seems reluctant to share information about Lucy's murder.

TOM: I don't know what you're looking for, Jess. But like I said, this was a robbery gone wrong.

Jessica looks unconvinced and presses on.

JESSICA: You didn't find any signs of forced entry?

TOM: No... must have been someone she knew.

As Jessica leaves the sheriff's office, we see her glance around at the small town's residents, all seemingly hiding secrets. She approaches a local shopkeeper, MRS. GIBSON (60), who seems hesitant to speak with her.

MRS. GIBSON: Jess... I don't know what you're talking about.

Jessica notices Mrs. Gibson's fingers are stained with blood and takes out her notebook.

JESSICA: I'm looking for information on Lucy's murder. Can you tell me anything?

Mrs. Gibson glances nervously around, then leans in close to whisper a cryptic message:

MRS. GIBSON: Be careful, Jess... this case is deeper than it seems.

**Act III:**

As Jessica continues her investigation, she discovers that Lucy was investigating a series of disappearances in the area, all connected to an old abandoned mine on the outskirts of town.

Jessica decides to explore the mine herself, despite the sheriff's warning about its dangers. As she ventures deeper into the mine, we hear strange noises and see glimpses of apparitions in the darkness.

Suddenly, Jessica's flashlight flickers out, plunging her into complete darkness. She fumbles for matches but finds none. We hear a faint whispering in her ear:

VOICE: (whispering) You're getting close...

Jessica frantically tries to find her way back, but we realize she may be lost forever.

Suddenly, the team is ambushed by heavily armed mercenaries. A firefight erupts as the Phoenix Force Recon operatives take cover and return fire.

CUT TO:

The team infiltrates the lab, where they discover a massive prototype drone unlike anything they've ever seen before.

TECHNICIAN (28)
Captain, this thing is huge! And it's got some kind of advanced targeting system.

Alright, let's get out of here. We need to disable the drones and exfil.

The team quickly gets to work, hacking into the facility's mainframe and disabling the drone systems.

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape. The only sound is the howling wind and the occasional creak of twisted metal.

We see a lone figure, JAX (35), trudging through the wreckage of a small town, searching for... something. His worn backpack contains his meager supplies: water, food, first aid kit, and a pistol with a single bullet.

As he walks, we catch glimpses of the devastation around him: overturned cars, shattered glass, the twisted remains of buildings. Jax's eyes are sunken, his skin pale, and his expression haunted.

Jax stops in front of a small, dilapidated gas station. The sign creaks in the wind: "Last Hope Station". A faint light flickers from within.

**Act II:**

Inside the gas station, we find JAX's reflection staring back at him from a broken mirror. He approaches the counter, where an old, worn-out radio plays static-filled news reports of... nothing. The world has ended, and there's no further information available.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the back room: ELIZABETH (50), a grizzled, battle-hardened woman who seems to have been running Last Hope Station for years.

She eyes Jax warily, assessing his potential as a threat or ally. "What do you want?" she asks curtly.

Jax explains that he's searching for... something ‚Äì a place to belong, perhaps, or a reason to keep going. Elizabeth listens skeptically, then reveals that the radio broadcasts are just an old recording loop, repeated ad infinitum. There's been no news in years.

As they talk, we see snippets of Jax's past: his family, friends, and loved ones ‚Äì all lost in the disaster. We glimpse a world where hope seemed to be extinguished, one by one.

**Act III:**

The night falls outside. Elizabeth offers Jax a place to sleep in exchange for watching the station. As they sit by the radio, playing the recording loop like a dirge, Jax begins to open up about his past.

Elizabeth listens intently, offering occasional nods and words of encouragement. The tension between them dissipates as they commiserate about their shared losses.

As the night wears on, the radio broadcast changes ‚Äì ever so slightly. A hint of static disappears, replaced by a faint whisper: "... Hope Station, this is Haven-2. Come in, Over..."

Jax's eyes snap towards Elizabeth, filled with a glimmer of hope he thought was lost forever.

The camera zooms out as the two strangers share a look of mutual understanding ‚Äì and possibly something more. The world outside may be dead, but within these walls, there might still be a chance for human connection, redemption, or even rebirth.

Jim is seen leaving the abandoned radio station, looking determined. As he walks away, we see a figure watching him from across the street. It's an older version of himself.

Jax! Thank God you're here. We need to get out of here, now!

JAX
(approaching her)
What happened?

LENA
(exhaling)
The militia got too close. I managed to take out their comms and most of their vehicles, but... (she gestures to the outside) this is what we have to show for it.

Jax nods, taking in the information. They both know that in this unforgiving world, sometimes you have to burn it all down to start anew.

Good to see you're still in one piece, kid. What brings you here?

You're one tough son of a gun to get out of this alive. We've been tracking you for months.

No more running, Jax. It's time to join the fight.

INT. JESS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jess steps into her childhood bedroom, now dusty and forgotten. A single bed sits against one wall, a small table by its side with a lone lamp flickering on top.

JESS
(whispering)
It's been... years. Years since I've been back here...

As Jess looks around the room, we notice strange things: a bookshelf that seems to be out of place, a window that appears open despite being closed tight... and then there are the whispers.

They start as barely audible murmurs, but grow louder and more urgent. The camera zooms in on Jess's face as she tries to make sense of the whispers. They're not just whispers - they're words, phrases even...

JESS
(frustrated)
What do you want me to know?

The whispers seem to be coming from all directions at once. Jess spins around the room, trying to pinpoint their source.

CUT TO:

INT. BLACKWOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jess's grandmother, MRS. BLACKWOOD (60s), sits at a kitchen table, staring at a cup of tea in front of her. The camera lingers on her face, which is both familiar and unsettling.

MRS. BLACKWOOD
(to herself)
You see them too, don't you? The ones who are still here...

Jess enters the kitchen, trying to make sense of what's happening.

JESS
(grabbing Mrs. Blackwood's arm)
What do you mean?

Mrs. Blackwood's eyes flicker with a hint of madness as she leans in close.

MRS. BLACKWOOD
(whispering)
This house... it's not just a house, dearie. It's a prison. A prison for the living and the dead...

The camera zooms out as Jess looks around the kitchen, her eyes adjusting to the darkness that seems to be seeping into every corner.

CUT TO:

EXT. BLACKWOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Jess stands outside the mansion, her face pale and scared. She turns back to the house, which seems to loom larger than before.

JESS
(whispering)
I have to get out of here...

As she runs away from the house, the camera lingers on its facade, the whispers growing louder still... until the screen fades to black.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A group of young adults, all in their early twenties, are huddled around a makeshift computer terminal. They're dressed in casual clothes, with laptops and tablets scattered around them.

DAX (played by a charismatic actor like Chris Hemsworth)
Alright, guys! We've got the encryption cracked. Now it's time to access the Eclipse Database.

The group looks at each other nervously as Dax types away on the computer. Suddenly, the screen flickers to life, revealing a cryptic message:

**CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTATION CONFIRMED**

Suddenly, the lights in the warehouse begin to strobe, and an ear-shattering sonic boom shakes the air. The group is thrown off balance.

DAX
Whoa! What's going on?!

The camera cuts to a figure standing at the edge of the warehouse, silhouetted against the night sky. This is **AURA**, the protagonist of the series (played by an actress like Zendaya).

AURA
(smiling)
Time for you guys to meet me.

Aura leaps into action, her agility and strength on display as she effortlessly dodges obstacles and disarms security cameras. She approaches the group, who stare in awe at her abilities.

DAX
Whoa...who are you?

AURA
My name is unknown. But I'm here to tell you that your secrets are safe with me.

CUT TO:

INT. ECLIPSE CITY HALL - NIGHT

The EclipseElite team (Dax, Aura, and their friends) gather around a holographic display projecting an image of the city's infrastructure.

LUNA (played by a tech-savvy actress like Alison Brie)
Alright, let's review the Eclipse Algorithm. We've hacked into the system to analyze patterns...

Suddenly, a burst of light explodes from the hologram, causing it to flicker wildly. Luna looks up, alarmed.

LUNA
Guys...I think we have an intruder in our midst!

The camera cuts back to Aura, who steps forward with an intense expression.

AURA
(smiling coldly)
You're right, Luna. I'm not the only one watching over this city.

(to Lord Rathor)
I've summoned you here today to inform me of the latest developments in the gilded gauntlet competition.

LORD RATHOR
(bowing)
Your Majesty, I have grave news. The first round of challenges has been completed, and it seems that only three contestants remain: Kaelin Darkshadow, a skilled assassin; Lyra Moonwhisper, an accomplished thief; and Arin Vexar, a charismatic sorcerer.

KING ARIN III
(skeptical)
And which one do you think will emerge victorious?

I fear it's not just a matter of skill, Your Majesty. Rumors have been circulating about dark forces manipulating the competition from behind the scenes.

We'll see about that. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.

ARIN VEXAR
(chuckling)
This is going to be fun. Let's show them what we're made of.

FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see JASON (30s), a lovable but slightly awkward guy, sitting across from SARAH (20s), a hipster barista with a passion for bad jokes.

SARAH
So, Jason, what makes you think you're the perfect candidate for our coffee shop's new barista position?

JASON
Well, Sarah, I'm just a latte enthusiasm and a shot of energy. Plus, I've got a cappuccino of experience in customer service.

SARAH
(sarcastically)
Oh, wow. That's a grande idea.

JASON
(laughing) Hey, at least I'm brewin' up some confidence!

Sarah rolls her eyes good-naturedly.

SARAH
Okay, okay. Let's move on to the next question. What would you do if a customer asked for a coffee with no cream or sugar?

JASON
Easy! I'd say, "That's just black and white... but I can make it happen!"

Sarah raises an eyebrow.

SARAH
(skeptical)
Uh-huh. Well, Jason, that's the last question. Do you have any final words to convince me you're the right guy for the job?

JASON
Nailed it! I'm just a bean above the rest when it comes to coffee-making skills!

Sarah facepalms.

SARAH
(exasperated)
Okay, Jason... I think we've seen enough. But don't worry, I'll be in touch soon to let you know if you got the job...

JASON
(standing up excitedly)
That's the percolator way to end an interview!

Sarah just shakes her head and starts typing on her phone.

SARAH
(to herself) Okay, Google... what's the worst pun I can use in a job rejection email?

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason is pacing back and forth, waiting to hear from Sarah about the job interview. His roommate, MIKE (30s), walks into the room.

MIKE
Dude, how did it go? Did you get the job?

JASON
It was a latte fun... but I think I bombed the puns part of the interview.

MIKE
(laughing)
Well, at least you're brewin' up some humor!

Jason chuckles and throws his hands up in exasperation.
