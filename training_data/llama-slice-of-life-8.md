Addison looked at him. "Really? What was your favorite part?"

"I liked Tokyo," said Elbert. "It's so busy and exciting. The food is great too."

Leonard nodded. "I've always wanted to go to Tokyo. What did you eat there?"

"Udon noodles, sushi, and ramen," replied Elbert. "And have you guys ever tried Japanese curry? It's really good."

Addison shook her head. "No, I haven't tried it yet."

"I'll make some when we get home," said Leonard with a smile.

The bus stopped at the next stoplight. The three friends sat in silence for a moment, watching the world go by outside their window.

Addison broke the silence, "I've heard that Japan has beautiful gardens and temples. Have you seen any of those, Elbert?"

"Yes," replied Elbert. "I visited a temple in Kyoto. It was very peaceful."

Leonard looked curious. "What was it like inside?"

"The temple had many Buddha statues and traditional art," said Elbert. "It felt spiritual, but also really beautiful."

The bus continued on its route, the three friends lost in thought about their experiences with Japan.

As they approached their stop, Addison turned to the others. "Let's plan a trip to Japan together soon."

Mike sat down and looked at Kinsley with a curious expression.

Mike: "What were you thinking about?"

Kinsley: "Alabama."

Mike raised an eyebrow.

Mike: "Alabama? What's so interesting about Alabama?"

Kinsley took another sip of his beer before answering.

Kinsley: "Well, I was just reading about the state. It's one of the largest in the US, but it's also very flat. Did you know that the highest point is only 2,400 feet above sea level?"

Mike shook his head.

Mike: "No, I didn't know that. What else did you read?"

Kinsley pulled out a brochure from his pocket and began to read aloud.

Kinsley: "'The Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville has the world's largest Saturn V rocket on display... The state is also home to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center.' It's really cool stuff."

Mike listened intently, taking notes on a napkin as Kinsley spoke.

Mike: "I had no idea about that. It sounds like Alabama might be more interesting than I thought."

Kinsley smiled, pleased with himself for sharing his knowledge.

Kinsley: "Yeah, it's definitely worth learning more about. Maybe we can plan a trip there someday."

Mike nodded in agreement and they both sat back to enjoy their drinks, chatting softly as the pub continued to bustle around them.

Vickie nodded. "Yeah, that's true. Maryland has a lot of old buildings and museums."

"I've heard of the Eastern Shore," Henrietta said. "Is that nice?"

"It's beautiful," Vickie replied. "You should go visit Crisfield sometime. It's a tiny town with great seafood."

Laurie nodded. "I've been to Bar Harbor once. It was beautiful. So many trees and water everywhere."

"That's the part I love most," Makenzie said, adding some vegetables to the stew. "The woods are so peaceful in the fall. And then the ocean is just...wow."

"Hey, have you seen that Shark show?" Melvin asked, putting down his cup.

"No," Rachel replied, "What's it about?"

"It's a reality TV show where people try to sell stuff they find at garage sales and thrift stores for a profit. They think some of these things are really valuable."

Rachel raised an eyebrow. "That sounds interesting. What made you start watching it?"

Melvin shrugged. "I saw an episode with my mom last week, and we were both surprised by how much some of those items were worth. Like, this old lunchbox was sold for over a thousand dollars!"

Rachel laughed. "Wow, that's crazy! I wouldn't have thought that would be valuable at all."

Melvin nodded in agreement. "Yeah, it's weird what people will pay for sometimes. But it's also kind of cool to see what some people are willing to buy."

They both sat quietly for a moment, enjoying the warm sun and each other's company.

"I think I'm going to keep watching it," Melvin said finally. "It's pretty entertaining."

Rachel smiled. "I might have to join you sometime. Sounds like fun."

Grant closed his magazine and gestured for her to sit down. "How's it going?" he asked.

Joy took a seat next to Ximena. "It's going. Just waiting now. So, what were we talking about?"

"We weren't really talking about anything," Ximena said with a chuckle.

Grant grinned. "Well, actually... I was thinking about Apple."

Ximena raised an eyebrow. "Apple? What do you mean?"

Grant set his magazine down. "You know, the company. They just released their new phone and it's getting a lot of hype."

Joy leaned forward. "Oh yeah! I've been hearing about that. But isn't Apple also famous for its computers?"

Ximena nodded. "That's right. My dad has one of those MacBooks. He loves it."

Grant nodded thoughtfully. "Yeah, they're pretty popular. And their iPhones are everywhere now too."

"Mine too," Gus said. "I'm actually thinking about visiting India soon."

Rachel's eyes lit up. "India! That's amazing! Have you thought where to go?"

"Yes," Gus said, nodding. "One place I really want to visit is Varanasi. I've heard so much about the Ganges River."

Rachel leaned in, interested. "Oh? What do you know about it?"

Gus took a sip of his coffee before answering. "Well, from what I've read, the Ganges is super sacred in India. People come from all over to bathe and pray there."

"That's true," Rachel said softly. "It's also known for its beauty. The sunrises are supposed to be incredible."

Gus nodded in agreement. "I've seen pictures. It looks breathtaking. I really want to see it with my own eyes."

Rachel got her coffee and took a sip, looking thoughtful. "The Ganges is so much more than just a river, though. It's the lifeblood of India."

Gus leaned forward, intrigued. "What do you mean?"

Rachel smiled gently. "It's the connection between the people, their traditions, and their culture. You can't separate it from all that."

Gus nodded, his eyes wide with understanding. "I see what you mean. It's like a living thing, isn't it?"

Rachel nodded in agreement. "Exactly."

Their conversation trailed off as they sat there for a moment, lost in thought. They didn't have much time left before their flights called them to board, but in that quiet lounge, the Ganges had become more than just a river - it was a connection between two people.

"Hey George," Francis said, "do you like chicken?"

Francis thought for a moment before answering. "It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And they had this special sauce that made it even better."

Roosevelt's eyes widened. "Wow, that must have been cool! What was it like to see a tiger in person?"

Jade asked, "Did you get to feed it or anything?"

Hector smiled. "No, but I did get to see it eat lunch. That was pretty cool too."

Roosevelt turned to Jade. "I've always wondered what tigers are like in the wild. Do you think they're as calm as the one at the zoo?"

Jade shrugged. "I don't know, but I hope so! It's hard to imagine them being aggressive."

Hector chimed in, "I read that tigers usually only attack humans when they feel threatened or scared. That makes sense."

Roosevelt nodded. "Yeah, that does make sense. Maybe we should visit a tiger sanctuary sometime and see for ourselves what they're like."

Jade grinned. "That sounds like a great idea! I'd love to go with you guys."

"Hey, I've been thinking," Harley said, looking at Jalen with a curious expression. "Do you think animals are more important than people?"

"Well," Harley began, "I was watching this documentary about endangered species. It's really sad to see how humans are hurting the environment and harming these amazing creatures."

Harley smiled. "Exactly! And it's not just that they're cute or fun to watch. Some animals are crucial for our ecosystem."

Jalen leaned back against the couch cushions, her eyes thoughtful. "I think we need to find a balance between taking care of ourselves and protecting the planet. We can't forget about animal welfare, but we also have to consider human needs."
