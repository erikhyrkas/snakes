Write a slice-of-life story about Maxine and Natalie discussing Hong Kong in a coffee shop.<start>Maxine and Natalie sat at a small table by the window, sipping their lattes. They were in a cozy coffee shop on a quiet street.

"I'm thinking of going to Hong Kong soon," Maxine said, looking out the window.

Natalie's eyes lit up. "Really? Why?"

Maxine put down her cup and leaned forward. "I've always wanted to see the Victoria Peak tram. I've heard it's amazing."

Natalie nodded enthusiastically. "That sounds cool! But you have to try some dim sum too. It's a must when you're in Hong Kong."

Maxine smiled. "Of course, I'll eat all the dim sum I can find." She took a sip of her latte.

The coffee shop was quiet, with only a few other customers. A barista was restocking the pastry case.

"What do you think about the protests in Hong Kong?" Natalie asked, her voice low.

Maxine's expression turned serious. "I'm not sure what to think. It's all been so confusing with the news and everything."

Natalie nodded in agreement. "Yeah, it's hard to know what's going on sometimes. I just hope things get better for the people there."

The two friends sat in silence for a moment, sipping their drinks.

After a while, Maxine spoke up again. "I'm actually thinking of visiting during the Lunar New Year celebrations. It'll be fun to experience the culture firsthand."

Natalie's eyes sparkled with excitement. "That sounds like an amazing idea! I'm sure you'll love it."

Write a slice-of-life story about Otis and Catherine discussing South Africa in a parkinglot.<start>Otis and Catherine sat in his car, parked in the lot outside her apartment building. It was a sunny afternoon, and they were enjoying the warmth.

"I'm telling you, Otis," Catherine said, turning to face him, "South Africa is an amazing country."

Otis raised an eyebrow. "Really? What's so great about it?"

Catherine smiled. "Well, first of all, have you ever seen pictures of Table Mountain? It's breathtaking. And the people... they're so friendly and welcoming."

Otis nodded thoughtfully. "I remember seeing that mountain on TV once. But I've also heard that there are some pretty big problems in South Africa, too."

Catherine sighed. "Yes, unfortunately, that's true. There's a lot of poverty and inequality, especially for the black people who were oppressed by the apartheid regime for so long."

Otis nodded sympathetically. "I can see why you'd be interested in it then. But what makes you want to go there?"

Catherine's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Oh, I've always wanted to visit Africa! And South Africa seems like a great place to start. I want to learn more about the culture and history, and maybe even volunteer for some projects that can help make a difference."

Otis smiled at her enthusiasm. "You're really passionate about this, aren't you?"

Catherine nodded. "Yeah, I am! And it's not just about South Africa â€“ it's about all of Africa, and the people who live there. They deserve our respect and support."

The two friends sat in comfortable silence for a moment, watching as people walked by outside the car.

"I think that's really cool," Otis said finally, turning to Catherine with a smile. "I'm happy to support you on this."

Write a slice-of-life story about James, Carroll, and Miriam discussing Moscow in a restaurant.<start>James, Carroll, and Miriam sat at a small table by the window in a cozy restaurant. They had just finished their lunch and were sipping coffee.

"I was thinking," James said, "about Moscow."

"What's so interesting about Moscow?" Carroll asked.

"Well," James began, "I've always wanted to visit Russia. I've heard it's a beautiful city with rich history."

Carroll leaned in. "I know what you mean. I've seen pictures of the Kremlin. It looks amazing."

Miriam nodded. "And have you heard about Red Square? I've been reading about it and it sounds incredible."

The three friends chatted for a while, discussing everything from the Moscow Metro to the Russian ballet.

"I'd love to see a performance at the Bolshoi," Miriam said wistfully.

"Me too," Carroll agreed. "I've heard their productions are world-class."

James smiled. "And we could visit during the winter. I've seen pictures of the snow-covered streets and it looks magical."

As they talked, the waiter brought over a tray with fresh pastries and tea. The three friends paused to enjoy their treats.

Carroll took a sip of her tea and said, "You know, maybe one day we'll make it to Moscow together."

James and Miriam exchanged a smile. It was a nice thought, and they all hoped that someday soon they would take the trip.

Write a slice-of-life story about Rachel and Garrett discussing Europe in a theater lobby.<start>Rachel leaned against the wall, her eyes fixed on Garrett as they stood in the dimly lit theater lobby. They had just watched a movie together and were discussing their thoughts on it.

Garrett was going on about his latest travel plans to Europe. "I'm so excited," he said, "to see all the famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben."

Rachel rolled her eyes good-naturedly. "You're going to London and Paris in the same trip?" she asked, a hint of amusement in her voice.

Garrett nodded enthusiastically. "Yeah! I figure why not? It's one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, right?"

Rachel shrugged. "I guess so. But don't forget to try some of the local food while you're there."

Garrett grinned. "Of course, I'll be eating all my weight in pizza and pasta. You know me too well."

As they talked, a group of noisy teenagers burst into the lobby, laughing and chattering loudly. Rachel winced at the sudden noise.

Garrett noticed her reaction. "Sorry about that," he said, raising his voice over the din. "Let's get out of here before it gets too crazy."

Together, they pushed through the crowd and made their way to the exit doors. Outside, the cool night air was a welcome respite from the warm lobby.

As they walked down the sidewalk, Garrett turned to Rachel with a thoughtful expression. "You know, I've always wanted to visit Italy," he said. "The history and art, it's just so fascinating."

Rachel nodded in agreement. "I'd love to go there too. Maybe one day we can plan a trip together."

Garrett smiled at the idea. "Sounds like a plan to me."

Write a slice-of-life story about Florence and Danny discussing Tsunami at a backyard patio.<start>Florence sat in a chair, her feet resting on the edge of the patio table. Danny sat across from her, his eyes fixed on hers.

"So, have you been thinking about the tsunami that happened last week?" Florence asked, her voice soft and curious.

Danny nodded slowly, taking a sip of his drink before responding. "Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot. It's just so sad what happened."

Florence leaned forward, her elbows on the table. "I know, right? I was watching the news and seeing all those people running away from the wave...it was like nothing I've ever seen before."

Danny set his drink down and rubbed his hands together. "And it made me think about how fragile our lives can be. Like, one minute you're walking along the beach, and the next...well, it's just gone."

Florence nodded thoughtfully. "Yeah, that's a scary thought. But at the same time, it's also kind of amazing how resilient people are. I mean, look at all those people who lost their homes and belongings...but they're still standing up for themselves."

Danny looked at Florence with a serious expression. "You know, I think that's what I'm trying to process right now. How we can just go on living our lives like nothing happened when something so huge has occurred?"

Florence leaned back in her chair, thinking about Danny's words. "I don't know...but maybe it's because we're all connected somehow? We're all in this together, and when someone gets hurt or loses everything...it affects us all."

Danny smiled softly at Florence, his eyes still serious but also understanding. "You might be onto something there."

Write a slice-of-life story about Carole and Mattie discussing Spain in a bookstore.<start>Carole and Mattie sat together at a small table in the bookstore, surrounded by shelves of books that stretched all the way to the ceiling. They had been friends since college, but it wasn't until recently that they started dating.

"I've always wanted to visit Spain," Carole said, running her finger over the spines of the books on the shelf.

"Why's that?" Mattie asked, looking at her with curiosity in his eyes.

"Because I love Spanish culture. The food, the music, the architecture... it all seems so beautiful and rich."

Mattie nodded thoughtfully. "I can see why you'd think that. Have you read any books about Spain?"

Carole shook her head. "No, but I've been looking for some recommendations. Do you have a favorite book about Spain?"

Mattie smiled. "Actually, I do. There's this one book by Lorca... he was a Spanish poet and playwright. It's called 'Poet in New York.' He wrote it while living in the United States, but it's all about his experiences growing up in Spain."

Carole's eyes lit up. "That sounds fascinating! I'll have to check it out."

As they talked, Mattie got up from the table and walked over to a nearby shelf. He pulled down a few books and handed them to Carole.

"Here, read these," he said. "There's one about flamenco music, another about Spanish history... and this one is a cookbook with all sorts of traditional recipes."

Carole took the books from him and smiled at Mattie. "Thank you! I'm going to love these."

The two friends sat back down together, surrounded by the musty scent of old books and the soft hum of conversation from other customers in the store. They spent the next hour browsing through the pages of their new books, enjoying each other's company as they explored the world of Spain.

Write a slice-of-life story about Jaclyn discussing Europe in a train compartment.<start>Jaclyn sat across from Tom, her eyes fixed on the passing landscape outside the window. They were both traveling by train to a nearby city.

"So, have you been to Europe before?" Jaclyn asked, turning to face him.

Tom shook his head, a smile spreading across his face. "No, I've always wanted to go, but never had the chance."

Jaclyn nodded thoughtfully. "I went last summer with my family. We visited France and Italy."

Tom's eyes widened with interest. "Wow, that sounds amazing! What was your favorite part?"

Jaclyn leaned forward in her seat. "The food, definitely. I mean, have you ever tried real Italian pizza? Or croissants from a French bakery?"

Tom chuckled. "No, but I'm definitely going to have to try those now!"

As the train rumbled on, they talked about their shared love of Europe and all it had to offer. Jaclyn pulled out her phone and started showing Tom pictures from her trip.

"Look at this!" she exclaimed, holding up a photo of the Eiffel Tower. "We took a sunset view of the tower, and it was stunning."

Tom's eyes widened again as he gazed at the picture. "Wow, that's incredible! You're making me really want to go now!"

Jaclyn grinned. "I knew I could convert you into an Europe fan!"

Write a slice-of-life story about Maria and Rudolph discussing Kepler's Supernova in a gym.<start>Maria sat on a bench, her back against the wall, and Rudolph beside her. They were in the middle of a gym, surrounded by people lifting weights and running on treadmills.

"Hey," Maria said, "I was reading about Kepler's Supernova yesterday."

Rudolph nodded, putting down his water bottle. "Yeah? What did you think?"

Maria leaned forward slightly. "It's crazy to think that something as big as a star can just explode in the sky and be seen by people all over Europe."

Rudolph chuckled. "I know, right? I mean, they didn't even have cameras back then to capture it. They had to draw what they saw."

Maria nodded. "Exactly! It was 1604, so yeah, no cameras. But still, the drawings are pretty impressive for the time period."

Rudolph stood up and stretched his arms above his head. "I guess it's also kind of cool that Kepler got to study it. He was a big astronomer back then."

Maria smiled. "Yeah, he definitely was. I'm actually reading about him right now. Did you know that his own students helped him gather data on the supernova?"

Rudolph sat back down beside her. "No, I didn't know that. That's really interesting."

Maria continued, "So yeah, it's pretty cool to see how people worked together to learn more about something as amazing as Kepler's Supernova."

Sadie, a young woman with curly brown hair, held up her glass of ale as she spoke to the others. "I'm telling you, chicken is the best protein out there."

Rick, a burly man with a bushy beard, chuckled and shook his head. "Oh no, I think beef is where it's at. There's nothing like a good steak."

Naomi, a petite woman with short blonde hair, leaned forward in her seat. "I'm not sure...I've had some amazing chicken salads in my time. But what about grilled cheeseburgers?"

Sadie grinned. "That sounds delicious, but let's focus on the bird for now." She pulled out a piece of paper from her pocket and began to read from it. "According to this article I read, chicken is an excellent source of protein and can be cooked in countless ways."

Rick snorted. "An article? You're basing your argument on an article?"

Sadie smiled mischievously. "Hey, someone's got to keep you two informed. Besides, it's not just about the facts â€“ it's also about taste. Have you ever had a good old-fashioned fried chicken dinner?"

Naomi perked up at this. "Actually, I think I have...at my grandma's house when I was a kid. It was amazing."

Rick's eyes lit up. "Now that sounds like something to try. But I'm still sticking with beef."

The three friends continued their discussion, laughing and joking as they went back and forth on the topic of chicken.

As the night wore on, the pub began to fill with more people, but Sadie, Rick, and Naomi remained lost in their conversation, enjoying each other's company and the simple pleasures of a quiet evening together.

"I've always wanted to visit New Hampshire," Alexandra said suddenly.

"Me too!" exclaimed Ashton. "I've heard it's very pretty there."

"What do you want to see?" Imogene asked, putting down the scissors and leaning against the counter.

"Well," said Alexandra, "I've always wanted to see the White Mountains. I've heard they're beautiful in the fall."

"I'd love to go hiking there sometime," Ashton said, her eyes lighting up.

"That would be amazing," agreed Alexandra. "And we could visit the Kancamagus Highway too. I've heard it's one of the most scenic drives in the country."

Imogene nodded enthusiastically. "I've seen pictures of it and it looks incredible. We should all go together someday."

Ashton grinned at her friends. "That would be a great adventure."

Alexandra got up from her chair to leave, but not before giving Imogene's hand a friendly squeeze. "We'll have to make that happen soon," she said.

Imogene smiled back at her friend. "Definitely. I'll start looking into it."

Ashton sat back in her chair and looked at Imogene. "You're the best hairstylist ever, you know that?"

Imogene chuckled as she resumed cutting Ashton's hair. "Thanks, I try my best."

Mathew sat beside her, holding her hand. Across from them, Everett leaned against the windowsill, looking out at the city below.

"Hey," Aubree said weakly, "I've been thinking about New York."

Mathew turned to face her. "What's that?"

"You know, the Big Apple?" Aubree smiled faintly. "Everett and I were talking about it the other day."

Everett turned from the window. "Yeah, we discussed how crazy it must be during rush hour."

Aubree nodded slowly. "I bet you're right. But have you guys ever been?"

Mathew shook his head. "No, never had the chance. We've talked about visiting, though."

Everett stood up straighter. "We should make a trip there soon! It's not every day you get to see the Statue of Liberty or walk across Times Square."

Aubree looked at them both with newfound determination. "You know what? I think we'll plan that for when I'm better. We can make it happen, and it will be amazing!"

Mathew squeezed her hand reassuringly. "We'll do just that. When the time comes, we'll go all in â€“ the bright lights, the energy... everything."

Everett nodded enthusiastically. "And we can grab a slice of pizza at Lombardi's! The first pizzeria in New York City."

Aubree smiled once more, feeling hope for their future plans.

Write a slice-of-life story about Micah and Janis discussing Earth in a bus.<start>Micah and Janis sat together in the bus, watching the city go by outside their window. They were both quiet for a while, each lost in their own thoughts.

Suddenly, Micah spoke up. "Hey, have you ever thought about how weird Earth is?" he asked Janis.

Janis looked at him curiously. "What do you mean?" she replied.

"Well," said Micah, "we're this tiny planet, floating in space with all these other huge planets and stars around us. And yet, we're the only ones that know about it."

Janis nodded thoughtfully. "I never really thought about it like that before," she said. "But what's even weirder is how different Earth can be from one place to another."

Micah smiled. "Exactly! Like, in some places, people live on islands in the water, and in others, they're surrounded by huge mountains. It's all so... varied."

Janis chuckled. "And then there's the weather," she added. "One minute it's sunny and hot, the next minute it's freezing cold and snowy. Earth can be really unpredictable sometimes."

Micah nodded in agreement. "Yeah, that's true. But despite all its weirdnesses, I think Earth is still a pretty amazing place."

Janis smiled at him. "I agree," she said. "It's definitely worth appreciating."

Write a slice-of-life story about Jaime discussing Himalayas in a convention center.<start>Jaime sat across from her friend, Alex, at a small table inside the crowded convention center. They had arrived early to secure a spot for their discussion about the Himalayas.

"Okay, so let's talk about the geography," Jaime said, taking out a notebook and pen. "The Himalayas are a mountain range in Asia."

Alex nodded. "That's right. They stretch across several countries, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan."

Jaime wrote down some notes on her paper. "And they're home to the highest peaks on Earth, right?"

"Yes," Alex said. "The tallest mountain is Mount Everest, which reaches an elevation of over 29,000 feet. That's really high!"

"Wow," Jaime agreed. "I've heard it's not easy to climb. What about the culture and history of the region?"

Alex leaned forward in her chair. "Well, the Himalayas have been home to many different cultures for thousands of years. There are several major ethnic groups that live in the area, each with their own language and customs."

Jaime scribbled down some more notes. "That's really cool. And what about the environmental impact of tourism in the region?"

Alex nodded thoughtfully. "It's a big issue. As more people visit the Himalayas to climb or trek, there's a growing concern about preserving the natural habitat and wildlife."

Jaime closed her notebook. "Okay, I think that's enough for today. We've got a good foundation for our discussion."

Alex smiled. "Yeah, let's do it again sometime soon."

Write a slice-of-life story about Tami and Wilbert discussing United States at a university campus.<start>Tami and Wilbert sat on a bench in front of the student union building on their university's campus. It was a warm afternoon, and they had decided to take a break from studying.

"I'm so tired," Tami said, running her hand through her hair.

"Me too," Wilbert replied, stretching his arms above his head. "But we need to get our minds off things for a bit."

Tami nodded in agreement. "Yeah, let's talk about something else."

Wilbert thought for a moment before speaking up. "How much do you know about the United States?"

Tami furrowed her brow. "Not too much, I guess. We learned some basic history and geography in high school, but that's it."

Wilbert nodded sympathetically. "Yeah, same here. I've always wondered how they managed to become such a powerful country."

"I know what you mean," Tami said, leaning forward. "I've heard their economy is huge, and their cities are so modern and developed."

"That's true," Wilbert said, thinking out loud. "But have you ever thought about the Native American cultures that existed before they became a country?"

Tami shook her head. "No, I don't think we covered that in school."

Wilbert pulled out his phone and started searching for information on his browser. "Let's see... Okay, it looks like there were many different tribes with their own languages and customs."

Tami watched as Wilbert scrolled through the pages. "Wow, I had no idea," she said, her eyes widening in surprise.

Wilbert looked up at her, a thoughtful expression on his face. "Yeah, there's so much more to learn about them and their history."

As they continued to discuss the topic, Tami and Wilbert found themselves becoming more interested and engaged with each other. They realized that learning something new could be just as enjoyable as studying for exams.

After a while, Wilbert closed his phone and looked at Tami. "You know what? I think we should take a trip to the United States sometime."

Tami's eyes lit up. "That sounds amazing! We could learn so much more about their culture and history firsthand."

Wilbert smiled. "Exactly. And who knows, maybe we'll even get to see some of the Native American reservations."

As they finished their conversation, Tami and Wilbert sat in comfortable silence for a moment, both lost in thought as they imagined themselves exploring the United States together.

Write a slice-of-life story about Mildred, Traci, and Lance discussing New Mexico in a barber shop.<start>Mildred sat in the barber's chair, surrounded by the familiar smell of hair clippers and the hum of the TV playing sports highlights. Traci snipped away at her friend's bangs, while Lance gave a close shave to a customer in the back.

"Hey, guys," Mildred said, "have you ever been to New Mexico?"

Traci put down her scissors and leaned against the counter. "Yeah, I was there once with my family on vacation. My cousin lives in Albuquerque."

Lance wiped away some soap from his customer's face. "That's cool! What did you do there?"

Mildred thought for a moment before speaking up. "We went to this one museum that had all these ancient Indian artifacts. It was really interesting." She turned to Traci. "How about your cousin? Does he like living in Albuquerque?"

Traci smiled. "Yeah, he loves it. He says the weather's not so bad once you get used to it."

Lance chuckled as his customer grumbled good-naturedly. "I can imagine," Lance said with a grin.

Mildred turned back to Traci. "What made your cousin move there?"

Traci shrugged. "I think he just wanted a change of pace from California. He said the people in New Mexico are really friendly."

Lance finished his customer's shave and helped him out of the chair. "That's true," Lance agreed. "I met some great people when I visited Santa Fe."

Write a slice-of-life story about Mateo, Hazel, and Maddox discussing Venus in a grocery store aisle.<start>Mateo stood between Hazel and Maddox in the cereal aisle, surrounded by boxes of oatmeal and granola. They were all staring at a small poster on the wall that showed a picture of Venus.

"I never thought I'd care about another planet," Mateo said, "but have you guys seen how close it is to Earth?"

Hazel nodded. "Yeah, it's really weird. Did you know that sometimes Venus shines brightly in the sky and sometimes it's super hard to find?"

Maddox added, "My dad told me it's because of something called 'phases.' When Venus goes around the Sun, we can see different amounts of its light."

Mateo looked curious. "Phases? What do you mean by that?"

Hazel explained, "It means that when Venus is between the Earth and the Sun, it looks really small and doesn't shine very much. But when it's on the other side of the Sun from us, we can see its whole face and it shines super bright."

Maddox pulled out a small notebook from his backpack. "I've got a drawing of Venus' phases right here somewhere..." He flipped through the pages until he found what he was looking for.

Mateo's eyes widened as he took in Maddox's simple but detailed drawing. "Whoa, I get it now! So, just like how we see different amounts of the Moon when it goes around the Earth, Venus does the same thing with the Sun?"

Hazel smiled. "Exactly! It's pretty cool to think about all these other planets going around in their own orbits."

As they continued to chat, a store employee came over and asked if they needed any help finding anything else. Mateo shook his head. "No thanks, we're just discussing Venus right now..."

The three friends stood there for a few more minutes, still talking about the planet as they wandered down the cereal aisle together.

"Hey, you know I'm originally from Mississippi?" Pat said, still looking up at the ceiling.

Caden's pen paused mid-air. "Yeah? That's cool! What was it like growing up there?"

Pat's gaze dropped to meet Caden's. "It was...different. Hot summers and swampy winters. People are generally nice, but we had our share of problems."

"What kind of problems?" Caden asked, his voice curious.

"Well," Pat said, choosing his words carefully, "there were issues with poverty and education in some areas. But also a lot of good things â€“ amazing food, beautiful landscapes...it's got its own charm."

Caden nodded thoughtfully, jotting down a few notes on his pad. "I've heard the catfish is great."

Pat chuckled. "It's not just the catfish! We had gumbo, fried green tomatoes...the whole shebang."

The two coworkers sat in comfortable silence for a moment, Pat lost in thought about his Mississippi roots.

Caden broke the spell, asking, "You think you'd ever move back?"

Pat looked at him, serious now. "I don't know. It's hard to leave family behind, but I love my life here too."

Their conversation continued, with Caden asking more questions and Pat sharing stories about his time in Mississippi. The office around them receded into the background as they talked on, lost in their discussion of the Magnolia State.

Write a slice-of-life story about Gene and Lena discussing Vatican in a gym.<start>Gene sat on the bench, unwrapping his water bottle as he looked at Lena, who was stretching her arms over her head.

"Hey, I've been thinking," Gene said, taking a sip of water. "We were just talking about how big the Vatican is."

Lena nodded, lowering her arms and looking at him with interest. "Yeah, it's huge! The largest building in the world, right?"

Gene shook his head. "No, actually it's not that big. It's still really big, though â€“ over 110 acres. That's like a small town."

Lena raised an eyebrow. "Wow, I had no idea. What's so special about it, anyway?"

"Well," Gene said, standing up and walking to the treadmill, "the Vatican has its own government, postal system, and even its own police force â€“ the Pontifical Swiss Guard. It's basically a tiny country within Rome."

Lena followed him on the treadmill, running in place beside him as they talked. "That's so cool! What do you think is the most interesting thing about it?"

Gene thought for a moment before answering. "I think what's really amazing is that it's been around since 1929 â€“ it was established by treaty between Italy and the Holy See. That's over 90 years ago!"

Lena nodded enthusiastically. "That is crazy! I had no idea history could be so interesting."

As they ran, Gene and Lena continued to chat about the Vatican, learning new facts and discussing what they thought made it such a unique place.

After a few minutes of running, Gene called out over his shoulder. "Hey, do you want to grab some water?"

Lena nodded, following him off the treadmill as he walked to the water cooler. As they poured themselves drinks, Gene turned to Lena with a grin. "You know what? I'm glad we're learning about history together."

Lena smiled back at him. "Me too," she said, clinking her water bottle against his in a friendly toast.

Write a slice-of-life story about Aurora and Angel discussing Big Bang in a hallway.<start>Aurora stood still, looking down at her feet. Angel walked beside her, hands in pockets.

"Hey, did you know that everything in the world started from a single point?" Aurora asked quietly.

Angel stopped and turned to face her friend. "What are you talking about?"

"The Big Bang," Aurora said softly. "It's like... imagine all matter in one tiny spot. Then, it just exploded into all the stars and planets we see today."

Angel leaned against the wall, eyes squinting slightly. "Wow, that sounds crazy. But cool at the same time."

Aurora nodded. "Yeah. I think about it sometimes when I'm out walking at night and look up at the stars. It's like... whoa."

Angel chuckled softly. "Whoa is right."

The two friends stood there for a moment in silence, looking down the hallway.

"So, what happened before that single point?" Angel asked after a while.

Aurora thought about it for a second. "I'm not really sure. Some people say it's still unknown, but others think maybe it was just always here and we don't know how it started."

Angel looked thoughtful. "Hmm. I never thought of it that way."

The girls stood there for another minute before Angel pushed off from the wall. "We should get to class. We don't want to be late."

Aurora nodded, putting her hands back in pockets. Together, they continued down the hallway.

"I've always wanted to visit Europe," Tanner said, looking around at the tall trees.

"Me too," Alex replied. "I've heard the cities are amazing."

"What's the first place you'd want to go?" Tanner asked.

"Hmm... probably Paris," Alex said thoughtfully. "I've seen pictures of the Eiffel Tower. It looks incredible."

"I've always wanted to visit Rome," Tanner said, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "I've heard the Colosseum is huge."

"Wow, that sounds awesome," Alex said. "And I've heard the food in Italy is amazing."

"Yeah, I'd love to try some real Italian pizza and pasta," Tanner agreed.

As they walked, the trees grew taller and the path began to wind its way down a small hill. Tanner and Alex followed the trail, their feet carrying them along easily.

"Do you think we'll ever get to Europe?" Alex asked, breaking the silence between them.

"Definitely," Tanner said with confidence. "We just need to save up some money and plan a trip."

Alex nodded in agreement. "Yeah, that sounds like a great plan."
