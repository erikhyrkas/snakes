Write a wiki article about Lightning.<start>**Lightning**

Lightning is a big spark of electricity that comes from the sky. It happens when there is thunderstorm.

**What causes lightning?**

Lightning is made by special clouds in the sky called thunderheads. These clouds have warm air inside, which makes them rise high into the air. As they rise, they cool down and make water droplets. When these droplets get too heavy, they fall to the ground as rain.

Inside the cloud, there are also tiny particles that rub against each other. This rubbing creates electricity. The electricity builds up and gets stronger until it finally comes out of the cloud in a big spark – lightning!

**Types of lightning**

There are two main types of lightning:

* **Cloud-to-cloud lightning**: This happens when lightning strikes between two clouds.
* **Cloud-to-ground lightning**: This is the most common type, where lightning strikes from a cloud to the ground.

**Safety**

Lightning can be very dangerous. If you see lightning or hear thunder, it's best to go inside and stay away from windows and doors. Don't try to watch the storm outside – it's not safe!

**Interesting facts**

* Lightning is incredibly hot – up to 50,000°C (90,000°F) hotter than the surface of the sun!
* A lightning bolt can weigh as much as a small car.
* Lightning can strike twice in the same place.

Write a wiki article about Lunar eclipse.<start>**Lunar Eclipse**

A lunar eclipse is when the Moon moves into the shadow of the Earth. This happens during a full moon night.

**Why does it happen?**

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are in a line with each other. The Earth blocks some or all of the sunlight that would normally reach the Moon. This creates three types of shadows on the Moon:

1. **Penumbra**: A partial shadow where the Earth only covers part of the Moon.
2. **Umbra**: A darker, complete shadow where the Earth completely covers part of the Moon.

**Types of Lunar Eclipses**

There are two main types of lunar eclipses:

1. **Penumbral Lunar Eclipse**: The Earth's penumbra falls on the Moon.
2. **Umbral Lunar Eclipse**: The Earth's umbra falls on the Moon. This can be further divided into:
	* **Total Lunar Eclipse**: The entire face of the Moon enters the umbra.
	* **Partial Lunar Eclipse**: Only a part of the Moon's surface is covered by the umbra.

**How long does it last?**

A lunar eclipse typically lasts for about an hour, but can be up to 3 hours long in some cases. During this time, the Earth's shadow changes shape and size on the Moon's surface.

**Rare Occurrences**

Lunar eclipses are relatively rare because the Earth, Sun, and Moon need to be aligned perfectly. This alignment occurs only a few times a year, but not all of these occurrences result in an eclipse that is visible from a specific location on Earth.

**Interesting Facts**

* During a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow can change colors due to the atmosphere filtering the sunlight.
* A lunar eclipse is safe to view with the naked eye. No special equipment or protection is needed.
* Lunar eclipses have been recorded in history for thousands of years and are often associated with folklore and mythology.

**When to Observe**

The best way to observe a lunar eclipse is from a location on Earth where the Moon will be above the horizon at night during the eclipse. Check online for specific dates and times, as these can vary from year to year.
