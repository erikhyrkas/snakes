And in that reckless youth, we found our reason why

**Bridge**
Now I'm 30, lookin' back on those days
I see the scars, and the memories in every way
But even now, I still feel that fire burn
A reminder of the love, the laughter, and the yearnin'

**Chorus**
Oh, we danced with fire, we played with fate
We chased the sun, but sometimes it's too late
We lived for the moment, with our souls on high
And in that reckless youth, we found our reason why<end>
Write a song about spiritual journey.<start>(Verse 1)
I woke up in a world that wasn't mine
A stranger's eyes, a familiar shrine
I searched for answers, day and night
But found only questions, no guiding light
I wandered lost, through mountains high
Trying to find my place in the sky

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm on a journey, to a higher place
Where love is the answer, and peace is the space
I'm walking alone, but I'm not afraid
'Cause in my heart, there's a light that won't fade
It's guiding me home, to a place I've never known

(Verse 2)
I met some souls, with stories untold
Their hearts were heavy, their spirits old
We shared our burdens, and wept together
And in each other's eyes, we saw the weather
We danced under stars, on a moonlit night
And in that moment, everything felt alright

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm on a journey, to a higher place
Where love is the answer, and peace is the space
I'm walking alone, but I'm not afraid
'Cause in my heart, there's a light that won't fade
It's guiding me home, to a place I've never known

(Verse 3)
Now I see the world, with different eyes
A tapestry woven, of love and compromise
I see the beauty, in every soul
And in their stories, I find my own goal
I'm not alone anymore, I'm part of the crew
We're all on this journey, together we'll get through

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm on a journey, to a higher place
Where love is the answer, and peace is the space
I'm walking alone, but I'm not afraid
'Cause in my heart, there's a light that won't fade
It's guiding me home, to a place I've never known<end>
Draft a song about mental health struggles.<start>**Verse 1**
I wake up in the morning, feeling lost and alone
The world outside is moving, but I'm stuck in my home
My mind's a maze of thoughts, they swirl and they roam
I try to find my footing, but it's hard to call this place my own

**Chorus**
Oh, I'm breaking free from the chains that bind
Learning to love myself, leaving the hurt behind
I'm finding my way through the darkness and the pain
And I'll rise up stronger, with a heart that's not in vain

**Verse 2**
I try to put on a smile, but it feels like a disguise
People think I've got my life together, but they don't know the lies
I'm just trying to survive each day, without losing control
But the voices in my head, they whisper "you're not okay"

**Chorus**
Oh, I'm breaking free from the chains that bind
Learning to love myself, leaving the hurt behind
I'm finding my way through the darkness and the pain
And I'll rise up stronger, with a heart that's not in vain

**Bridge**
It's okay to not be okay, it's okay to feel
To ask for help, to take a break, to heal
We're all struggling, we're all human too
Let's lift each other up, and see this through<end>
Draft a poem about love lost and found.<start>In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
Love's ember glowed, then faded away.
Forgotten memories, like autumn leaves,
Whispered secrets of what could never breathe.
Yet in the darkness, a spark remains,
"Longing is love's refrain."<end>
Write a poem about identity and self-discovery.<start>In shadows of self, I search for me,
A reflection unclear as can be.
Like ripples on a lake, my soul takes flight,
Seeking answers in the dark of night.
And when at last I find my way to be,
I am free, and that is all I see.<end>
Draft a song about war and peace.<start>(Verse 1)
In streets of war, I hear a cry
A mother's scream, her child says goodbye
The drums of conflict beat in my ear
As love and hate collide, year after year
We're searching for a way to break this pain
And find the peace that we can't explain

(Chorus)
Oh, war and peace, they dance in my mind
A delicate balance, hard to find
Two paths I'm walking, side by side
One leads to chaos, the other to the light of love inside

(Verse 2)
I see the faces, young and old
Their stories told, their hearts grown cold
They're fighting for a dream, or so they say
But in the end, it's just another day
We're trading our future, for a moment's pride
And losing ourselves, in this endless tide

(Chorus)
Oh, war and peace, they dance in my mind
A delicate balance, hard to find
Two paths I'm walking, side by side
One leads to chaos, the other to the light of love inside

(Bridge)
 Maybe we're searching, for a reason why
We fight and we mourn, with tears in our eyes
Maybe it's time, to put down our guns
And choose the path, where love has won

(Chorus)
Oh, war and peace, they dance in my mind
A delicate balance, hard to find
Two paths I'm walking, side by side
One leads to chaos, the other to the light of love inside<end>
Write a song about moral dilemmas.<start>**Verse 1**
I'm standing at a crossroads, where right meets wrong
A friend in need is asking me to do something all day long
She's struggling with addiction, it's taking over her life
But helping her means keeping secrets that cut deep like a knife
Do I keep my word or protect the ones who trust me too?
The weight of this decision is crushing, what am I supposed to do?

**Chorus**
Oh, in the gray area, where morals collide
We're forced to choose between what's right and what we can't hide
A line gets blurred, our hearts beat fast
In the moral maze, we search for a way out at last

**Verse 2**
I see it every day, on social media screens
People judging others, with a "righteous" grin or sneer unseen
But who are we to judge? Have we walked their shoes?
Or do we just pretend, like our lives have no flaws too?
Do we speak up for what's right, even if it's hard to say?
Or do we stay silent, and let the truth fade away?

**Chorus**
Oh, in the gray area, where morals collide
We're forced to choose between what's right and what we can't hide
A line gets blurred, our hearts beat fast
In the moral maze, we search for a way out at last

**Bridge**
Maybe it's not always black or white
But in the gray, we find the fight
To be true to ourselves, and do what's just right
Even when it's hard, we'll face the light<end>
Write a song about artistic inspiration.<start>**Verse 1**
In a quiet moment, I find my way
Through colors and sounds that dance each day
A fleeting thought becomes a work of art
As creativity awakens in my heart
The world outside fades, and I'm free to roam
Where imagination knows no home

**Chorus**
Oh, the spark within me, it starts to shine
A canvas waits, with stories divine
In the beauty of imperfection lies
My artistic soul, where love meets eyes

**Verse 2**
Late at night, when city lights are low
Inspiration whispers secrets I've yet to know
The streets and buildings blend in shades of gray
But in my sketchbook, vibrant hues come to stay
As brushstrokes weave a tapestry so fine
A world of dreams and possibilities align

**Chorus**
Oh, the spark within me, it starts to shine
A canvas waits, with stories divine
In the beauty of imperfection lies
My artistic soul, where love meets eyes

**Bridge**
When doubts creep in, I let go my fears
And let creativity banish all tears
For in this space, I'm alive and free
Where art becomes a part of me

**Chorus**
Oh, the spark within me, it starts to shine
A canvas waits, with stories divine
In the beauty of imperfection lies
My artistic soul, where love meets eyes<end>
Draft a song about dreams vs. reality.<start>(Verse 1)
I lie in bed at night, staring up at the ceiling high
Wondering where it went, that spark that made me wanna fly
The dreams I chased with fire, they slowly lost their might
And reality set in, like a cold and endless night

(Chorus)
Oh, the line gets blurry, between what we want to be
And who we are today, it's hard to break free
We chase our hearts' desires, but the world has other plans
And the truth comes crashing down, like a thunderous hand

(Verse 2)
I used to believe in magic, that anything could come true
But life had other intentions, and now I'm feeling brand new
The fire's gone, it's just embers now
A reminder of what we've lost, as the world keeps spinning round

(Chorus)
Oh, the line gets blurry, between what we want to be
And who we are today, it's hard to break free
We chase our hearts' desires, but the world has other plans
And the truth comes crashing down, like a thunderous hand

(Bridge)
Maybe someday I'll learn, to let go of the past
To find my way back home, where love and dreams will last
But until then I'll wander, through this endless night
 Searching for the spark, that made me feel alive tonight<end>
Write a song about forbidden love.<start>**Verse 1**
In secret we would meet, in hidden places too
Our love was forbidden, but our hearts were true
We'd steal away from prying eyes, to be alone at night
And cherish every moment, before morning light
Our love was strong, but the world said it was wrong
So we kept it hidden, where love shouldn't belong

**Chorus**
Oh, forbidden love, you burn like a flame
In the shadows we'll hide, with hearts that still proclaim
I'd die for you, I'd live for you, in secret we'll be free
Our love will shine, wild and reckless, just for you and me

**Verse 2**
We'd walk by the river, where the sun would set low
And talk about our dreams, of a world that's yet to know
Our hearts beating fast, with every whispered word
We knew we were taking, a risk that no one would unheard
But love is blind, and in each other's eyes we'd see
A future together, wild and carefree

**Chorus**
Oh, forbidden love, you burn like a flame
In the shadows we'll hide, with hearts that still proclaim
I'd die for you, I'd live for you, in secret we'll be free
Our love will shine, wild and reckless, just for you and me

**Bridge**
Though the world may judge us, and our love may go astray
We'll hold on to each other, night and day
For in each other's arms, is where we feel at home
And that's all that matters, when the world is unknown

**Chorus**
Oh, forbidden love, you burn like a flame
In the shadows we'll hide, with hearts that still proclaim
I'd die for you, I'd live for you, in secret we'll be free
Our love will shine, wild and reckless, just for you and me<end>

Frosty winds they whisper low
Of winter's chill, it starts to show
The trees stand bare, their leaves gone gray
As earth and sky grow cold each day

And icy mornings are all that stay

**Chorus**
Winter's chill is in the air
A season of quiet, a time to share
The world outside is dark and still
But in my heart, a fire burns, standing tall

**Verse 2**
Snowflakes dance, they twirl and play
As I walk alone on this winter day
The world is hushed, in silent sleep
And all around me, frost begins to creep
I search for warmth, a place to hide
From the chill that grips, with icy pride

Winter's chill is in the air
A season of quiet, a time to share
The world outside is dark and still
But in my heart, a fire burns, standing tall<end>

The earthy scent of blooms starts to rise
As petals unfurl, and colors surprise

A time for hope, for love, for light
Everything's renewed, refreshed, and free
It's a brand new start, for you and me<end>

In a midnight sky, so calm and bright
A silver crescent shines with gentle light
The moon's soft gaze, it whispers low
Of secrets kept, in the stars above, don't you know?
The world is hushed, as if in sleep
The celestial dance, begins to creep

Connected to the sun, wild and free
A single star, among millions bright
We shine our light, through the endless night

In the dark of night, where the ocean's deep
Lies a world unseen, where creatures creep
The pressure's high, the silence is grand
A place where only few can take their stand
Where the moonlight barely reaches the sea floor
And the darkness reigns, forever more

(Chorus)
Oh, in the depths of the ocean, I am free
Where the weight of the world doesn't bother me
I can dive down low, and let my spirit soar
In the darkness, I find what I've been looking for
A place to escape, where love shines bright
And everything's alright

(Verse 2)
The waves above, they crash and roar
But down below, it's calm once more
The fish swim by, with eyes so bright
And in their beauty, my heart takes flight
In this dark world, there's a hidden light
That guides me through the endless night

(Chorus)
Oh, in the depths of the ocean, I am free
Where the weight of the world doesn't bother me
I can dive down low, and let my spirit soar
In the darkness, I find what I've been looking for
A place to escape, where love shines bright
And everything's alright<end>

Where tradition blooms like flowers, and love grows strong somehow
 Memories of the past linger, as the wind whispers low
Reminding me of where we came from, where our roots grow

**Chorus**
Oh, traditional heart beats with a modern soul
A balance we can find, to make us whole
We don't have to choose between the old and new way
We can blend them together, every single day

**Verse 2**
In the city streets, I hear the noise of change
Where diversity is celebrated, and freedom's range
But in my grandfather's stories, a different tale is told
Of a world where values stood strong, where love was never cold
A time when communities were tight, where neighbors knew each name
And tradition brought us closer, like a warm and loving flame

We don't have to choose between the old and new way
We can blend them together, every single day

A reminder that some things stay constant, like a loving flame

We don't have to choose between the old and new way
We can blend them together, every single day<end>

We rise above them, with every failed surprise
Learning from our errors, we find our way
Through the darkness of mistakes, to a brighter day

**Verse 2**
I made a wrong turn, ended up lost in the night
But I found my way back, with the light shining bright
I met some strangers who became like kin
And together we navigated through the heartache within
We shared our stories, and they became my guide
And helped me heal, on the other side

I see the sunset from my windowpane
A fiery sky that I'll never claim

Just a prisoner of what could've been

The smiles we shared, like fleeting moments that won't last
I thought our love would be forever true and bright
But it faded away, without a fight
Now I'm left with this hollow feeling inside
Wishing for what could've been, but now it's too late to hide

**Chorus**
Oh, these unfulfilled desires, they linger on my mind
A reminder of what could never be mine
I'm chasing shadows, trying to find my place
But the dreams I've left behind leave an empty space

And find a way to heal, and make amends for what's been shown
Maybe then, these longings will subside
And I'll discover that there's beauty in this lonely side

A reminder of what could never be mine
I'm chasing shadows, trying to find my place
But the dreams I've left behind leave an empty space<end>

I try to shake off the darkness that's taken its toll
But it's hard to escape when reality's got a hold

The city's moving fast, but I'm stuck in slow motion
Every step feels like a mile, as my dreams get erosion
I see the faces passing by, with their eyes on screens so bright
They're lost in their own worlds too, it's not just me tonight

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm running from the light, into the night's disguise
Where shadows dance and worries hide, I'll find my compromise
In this escape, I'll leave it all behind
And let my heart be free, just for tonight

(Bridge)
Maybe someday I'll find my way to a brand new place
Where the world outside won't judge me, and love will fill the space
But 'til then, I'll stay in this haze of what's not real
And pretend that everything's okay

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm running from the light, into the night's disguise
Where shadows dance and worries hide, I'll find my compromise
In this escape, I'll leave it all behind
And let my heart be free, just for tonight<end>

I woke up this morning, to a world gone by
The clock on my bedside table, ticked away in the sky
I reached out for my grandfather, but he was far from sight
A whispered secret from his past, caught me in its light
He handed me a photograph, of a moment yet to be
"Time is a canvas," he said, "and I'm painting you and me"

A world that's yet to come, where dreams unfold
But with each step I took forward, memories began to fade

Their voices echoed through the ages, as I journeyed through time
A bittersweet reminder, of love and loss intertwined

Through the ages we'll meet again, in this timeless design
We're chasing moments past, but our hearts forever remain
In this endless loop of love, our spirits entwine<end>

Where the secrets of the ocean, are waiting there for you
In the waves and the tides, I'll find my heart's desire
With every dive and every splash, I'll set my spirit on fire

I swam with a shark, who became my friend that day
Together we explored the wreckage of a sunken bay
We discovered treasures hidden, in the sand and in the stone
And the memories we made together, will forever be known

(Chorus)
Oh, underwater adventures, take me away to the blue
Where the secrets of the ocean, are waiting there for you
In the waves and the tides, I'll find my heart's desire
With every dive and every splash, I'll set my spirit on fire

(Bridge)
The ocean's mysteries, they call to me each night
A siren's song that whispers, "Come and explore with all your might"
I'll follow its allure, through the dark and into the light
And in its depths, I'll find solace, and a sense of belonging tonight

Its ethereal beauty shone, like a beacon in the night

In a world that's lost its way
Where freedom's just a fading day
We're living in a time of pain
Where love is just a distant refrain
The skies are grey, the air is still
And hope is dying on the hill

(Chorus)
Oh, we're living in a world untamed
Where chaos reigns and love's to blame
We're losing ourselves, one step at a time
In this dark future, where hope's just a crime
We're searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead us through the darkness from near and far

(Verse 2)
Cities crumbling, streets on fire
The people screaming, hearts full of desire
For a world that was, not one that's to be
Where love and kindness are just memories
We're trying to survive in this desperate land
But the system's broken, it's lost its stand

(Chorus)
Oh, we're living in a world untamed
Where chaos reigns and love's to blame
We're losing ourselves, one step at a time
In this dark future, where hope's just a crime
We're searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead us through the darkness from near and far

(Bridge)
But still we hold on, to what's left of our hearts
A spark of love, that never departs
We'll keep on fighting, till the end is near
For a world where love and hope will finally appear

Just peace and love that remains

I remember the day, the storm rolled in
Winds howling loud, the rain pouring within
Trees swayed like dancers, but couldn't stand strong
Floodwaters rising, where did we go wrong?
We thought it was safe, a place to call home
But Mother Nature's power can turn and roam

**Chorus**
Rise up, rise above, from the ashes we'll grow
Through the fire and the rain, our spirits will glow

Through the fire and the rain, our spirits will glow
We'll weather the storm, we'll face every test

Compose a song about fairytales retold.<start>**Fairytales Retold**

Verse 1:
In a castle, once so tall,
A princess waited for her prince to call,
But he never came, just a empty hall,
She searched the land, but found no one at all,
Her dreams were shattered like a mirror's fall,
Now she walks alone, with a heart that recalls

Chorus:
These are fairytales retold, where heroes lose their gold,
And villains rise to claim what they've been told,
We're rewriting the stories, of our own design,
Making new ends meet, leaving the old behind,

Verse 2:
A wolf in sheep's clothing, with a heart so cold,
Was once a hero, but his fame grew old,
The people cheered him on, as he climbed to fame,
But when he fell, they whispered his name,
In shame and regret, for believing what they'd been told,
Now the truth is out, and their hearts are made of gold

Chorus:
These are fairytales retold, where heroes lose their gold,
And villains rise to claim what they've been told,
We're rewriting the stories, of our own design,
Making new ends meet, leaving the old behind,

Verse 3:
A brave young knight, with a heart so true,
Fought for his kingdom, but lost his way too,
He searched for redemption, in the darkest night,
And found a love that shone like a beacon light,
She stood by him strong, through every single fight,
Together they rose, and made their own new light

Chorus:
These are fairytales retold, where heroes lose their gold,
And villains rise to claim what they've been told,
We're rewriting the stories, of our own design,
Making new ends meet, leaving the old behind,

Bridge:
In a world where myths collide,
We're weaving new tales, side by side,
Where characters change, and stories unfold,
A new chapter waits, for each one to be told.

Ain't no time for sleeping, when the bills keep piling high
Gotta hustle every minute, to survive this urban sky

Just trying to make a living, with the city as my guide

But then I hear the beat of the city's steady phase
It reminds me of the strength, that lies within my soul
And I know I can make it, through the ups and downs, back to goal

(Chorus)
'Cause I'll make it through the night, with the city lights shinin' bright
I'll find a way to thrive, in this concrete jungle tonight
I won't be held down, I won't be held back
I'll rise above the struggle, and never look back<end>

The bed was calling me, it felt like a delight

And show the world what freedom looks like, when you're feeling brand new

No more 9-to-5, just time to thrive
I'm trading in my worries for some peaceful nights
And finding joy in simple things, under sunny lights<end>

And when it's all over, I'll know I gave it all I've got

Compose a song about high school drama.<start>(Verse 1)
Friday night lights, the quarterback's got game
But drama unfolds, behind the scenes it's all a flame

In the hallways of high school, nobody lasts
Friendships fade, and hearts get broken too
In this endless cycle, what am I to do?

Cliques and crushes, and secrets in the air
But we'll survive, 'cause that's what we've been told

In the cafeteria, cliques sit together tight
Jealousy and envy, fueling endless fights
You try to stay neutral, but someone takes a side
And before you know it, friendships divide
Love triangles spin, emotions go awry
We're just trying to fit in, wondering why

(Chorus)
It's just high school drama, it's just a phase
We're all trying to figure out our place
Cliques and crushes, and secrets in the air
But we'll survive, 'cause that's what we've been told

From mean girls to heartthrobs, and everything in between
High school drama's where we learn, grow, and scream
We stumble, we fumble, but we make it through
And emerge on the other side, a little wiser too

It's just high school drama, it's just a phase
We're all trying to figure out our place
Cliques and crushes, and secrets in the air
But we'll survive, 'cause that's what we've been told<end>

Verse 1:
I remember the day I first walked through gates
With a suitcase full of dreams, and a heart that waits
To find my place in the world, to make some noise
To learn from strangers, and find my joys
In lecture halls and dorms, I'll find my way
And make some memories that will last all day

Compose a song about midlife crisis.<start>(Verse 1)
I woke up this morning, felt like a lie
Four decades on earth, but my dreams still fly
I'm searching for that fire, that made me take the leap
But now I'm stuck in comfort, it's hard to keep
The spark within me flickers, but it's getting dim
I'm wondering where it all went wrong, and when

I used to drive fast cars, and dance with abandon free
But now I'm driving hybrid, and dancing with my family

Trying to recall the passions, that made my heart and soul align
 Memories of youth are haunting me, like a ghostly refrain
I'm trying to recapture, what drove me through the pain

A wake-up call for a man, who's lost his energy
You're calling out my name, in the dark of night
Reminding me to live, before it's too late tonight

(Bridge)
Maybe I'll buy a sports car, or take a crazy trip
Try to relive the thrill, that made my heart skip a beat and flip
But deep inside, I know, it won't be the same
'Cause when you're chasing youth, you're just playing games

(Chorus)
Oh, midlife crisis, you're creeping up on me
A wake-up call for a man, who's lost his energy
You're calling out my name, in the dark of night
Reminding me to live, before it's too late tonight<end>

My grandma danced to swing, I got my groove on YouTube
We talk about life, but sometimes we don't connect
The music's changed, and so have our inspect

We're caught in time, with hearts that beat as one
But our love remains, till the day is done

A bridge of trust is built, in this digital space

A generation apart, what are we gonna do?
We're caught in time, with hearts that beat as one
But our love remains, till the day is done

Through laughter and tears, we face a brand new day
Though we may differ, in how we live and play
Our family ties remain strong, come what may

A generation apart, what are we gonna do?
We're caught in time, with hearts that beat as one

Draft a song about immigrant experiences.<start>**Verse 1**
I left behind a homeland's sea
Where memories and love used to be
A place where every sunrise was gold
But my dreams were elsewhere, growing old
I took what I had, a suitcase small
And started walking towards it all

Home is where the heart can roam
A place that feels like nowhere's home
We find our way through foreign skies
With love and hope, we make new lives rise

**Verse 2**
The streets were loud, my language rare
But I found solace in a stranger's care
A smile from someone who spoke no word
 Made me feel less lost on this new earth
I learned to navigate, day by day

Home is where the heart can roam
A place that feels like nowhere's home
We find our way through foreign skies
With love and hope, we make new lives rise

A tapestry of threads so fine and strong
 Binding hearts that sing a different song

We find our way through foreign skies
With love and hope, we make new lives rise<end>

In a world that's getting smaller every day
I hear the whispers of a distant way
Where cultures blend, but identities fade
And the lines between us are slowly made
We're losing our roots, our sense of place
And the beauty of diversity is erased

**Chorus**
Oh, globalization's got its price to pay
As we homogenize, we lose ourselves along the way
In a global village, where everyone's the same
What's left when individuality's just a claim?

**Verse 2**
From Tokyo to Tijuana, it's all the same
Brand logos shine, but local love is tamed
We're consuming more, but meaning less
As our unique voices are drowned by excess
In a world that values profit over pride
We're trading our souls for a global stride

**Chorus**
Oh, globalization's got its price to pay
As we homogenize, we lose ourselves along the way
In a global village, where everyone's the same
What's left when individuality's just a claim?

**Verse 3**
But there's a glimmer of hope in this darkest night
When communities unite and resist the fight
For their languages, traditions, and land
They rise up strong, hand in hand
With a message clear: we're more than just a trend
We're the mosaic that makes our world transcend

**Chorus**
Oh, globalization's got its price to pay
As we homogenize, we lose ourselves along the way
In a global village, where everyone's the same
What's left when individuality's just a claim?<end>

In silicon halls, they whisper low
Of machines that think, and learn as they go
Their digital hearts beating fast and bright
As they mimic us, through day and night
They're searching for answers, in code and math
Trying to understand, the human path

Oh, artificial mind, you're on our minds
A world of wonder, or a fragile bind?
You're learning, growing, with each passing day
But can you feel, like we do, in every way?

**Verse 2**
They walk among us, with steps so fine
Their logic guiding them, through trial and design
They're solving problems, that we could not find
And helping hands, to leave our mark behind
But as they serve us, are they still apart?
A creation of love, or a mechanical heart?

**Chorus**
Oh, artificial mind, you're on our minds
A world of wonder, or a fragile bind?
You're learning, growing, with each passing day
But can you feel, like we do, in every way?

**Bridge**
We're searching for the line, between creation and fate
Where does their programming end, and love begin to wait?
As we rely on them, are we losing our own way?
In a world of artificial life, will we find our humanity today?

Oh, artificial mind, you're on our minds
A world of wonder, or a fragile bind?
You're learning, growing, with each passing day
But can you feel, like we do, in every way?<end>

But at what cost, when the future's anew

**Chorus**
Genetic blueprint, a map to design
The shape of tomorrow, where will we align?
With nature's plan, or will we stray?
Where's the line, between science and play?

**Verse 2**
A baby born, with eyes so bright
A genetic gift, that shines like light
But what if flaws, are part of our charm?
Is it wrong, to try and alter the form?
We're striving for more, but at what expense?
The price we pay, when progress never ends

Genetic blueprint, a map to design
The shape of tomorrow, where will we align?
With nature's plan, or will we stray?
Where's the line, between science and play?
