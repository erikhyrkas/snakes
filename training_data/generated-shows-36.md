The local sheriff, JACE (40s), sits at a table sipping whiskey with his deputy, BUBBA (20s). Enter SHERIFF JESSE "BLACKJACK" McCOY (50s), a grizzled lawman from the nearby town of Red Rock.

SHERIFF McCHEY
(looking out the window)
Seems like trouble's brewin' in the Territory today, boys. Got some strangers comin' to town.

SHERIFF JACE
(skeptical)
What kind of trouble?

BLACKJACK McCOY
(scratching his jaw)
Word is they're from an outfit called "The Red Vipers". Heard they've got guns and a score to settle with the local rancher, Tom Jeffords.

BUBBA
(concerned)
You reckon that's the bunch Tom warned us about?

BLACKJACK McCOY
(serious)
That's the one. You boys best be ready for 'em.

CUT TO:

The Red Vipers arrive, led by their leader, VICTOR "THE WILD ONE" RAGLAN (30s). Victor eyes the townsfolk with disdain.

KALINDRA
(whispering to herself)
What did you do, Mother? What have I gotten myself into?

Kalindra holds up a small, intricately carved wooden box adorned with symbols of fire magic. A sudden gust of wind blows open the cottage door, causing Kalindra to gasp.

I should have known she'd be here. Where is she?

Kalindra opens the door, looking up at Erendor warily.

KALINDRA
Who are you? What do you want?

ERENDOR
(eyes locked on hers)
You know why I'm here. Your mother's... incident has put a target on your back.

KALINDRA
(skeptical)
Incident?

ERENDOR

We can talk about that inside. The winds are changing, Kalindra. You should prepare yourself.

CUT TO:

Kalindra and Erendor enter the cottage, where they're met with a peculiar sight: a smoldering candle on the kitchen table, surrounded by candles of various scents and colors.

KALINDRA
(uneasy)
What's going on?

ERENDOR
(serious)
Your mother was involved in something much bigger than herself. The threads of power are shifting. Magic users like us are being hunted.

Kalindra takes a step back, her eyes wide with fear.

MIKE: (confused) What do you mean?

JASON: We'll just pretend to be successful, and then we'll actually become successful because of the confidence boost!

We see a small community center, filled with eccentric characters. We meet our host, JASON (30s), a lovable but slightly awkward guy who's always getting himself into trouble.

JASON
(to the camera)
Welcome to No Judgement Zone! Where we celebrate our quirks and flaws, and make fun of them afterwards. Today, we're putting on the ultimate talent show!

CUT TO:

A group of contestants, each with their own unique talents, gathered in a circle.

There's LUCY (20s), a wannabe pop star who thinks she can dance like Beyoncé; JENNY (40s), a middle-aged mom who claims to be a professional juggler; and BRIAN (50s), a retired accountant who wants to do a magic trick that'll blow everyone's mind.

JASON
(excitedly)
And our special guest judge is... the infamous DR. LEE! (a wacky, eccentric scientist)

DR. LEE
(in his lab coat)
I'm here to provide scientific analysis of these... performances?

CUT TO:

The first act: Lucy's dance routine. She launches into an energetic performance, complete with elaborate hand gestures and a lot of flailing.

LUCY
(singing along to the music in her head)
"I'm a star! I'm a superstar!"

JASON
(invoice)
Wow, Lucy, you're like a cross between Beyoncé and... a flamingo?

The audience chuckles.

CUT TO:

Next up is Jenny's juggling act. She attempts to juggle three balls while riding an exercise bike.

JENNY
(confidently)
I've got this! I used to be in the circus!

JASON
(doubtful)
Uh, did you used to be in the circus... or are you just really good at falling off a bike?

The audience laughs harder.

CUT TO:

Brian's magic trick. He pulls out a deck of cards and starts shuffling them with reckless abandon.

BRIAN
(mysteriously)
I'll make this card disappear!

JASON
(skeptical)
Oh boy, here we go...

Brian attempts to force the card into his pocket, but ends up getting it stuck in his pants.

BRIAN
(flustered)
Uh... just give me a minute...

DR. LEE
(as an aside to Jason)
I'm detecting a significant amount of chaos theory at play here.

JASON
(grinning)
Well, that was certainly something!

CUT TO:

The final act: Dr. Lee himself performs a bizarre science experiment involving a chicken and some dry ice.

DR. LEE
(excitedly)
Behold! The fusion of art and science!

The audience looks on in confusion as the chicken starts to... not just sit there, but actually dance?

JASON
(amazed)
I don't know what's more impressive: Dr. Lee's scientific prowess or that chicken's moves.

CUT TO:

The judges' table, where Jason is trying to give his critique.

JASON
(hesitantly)
Uh... I think everyone had a great time? And by "great time," I mean a moderately entertaining time?

DR. LEE
(supportively)
Jason, don't be too hard on yourself. You're just starting out as a talent show host.

The episode ends with the contestants and audience members laughing and joking around, while Jason looks on nervously, hoping he'll get another chance to host No Judgement Zone again.

Please, you have to listen to me. My brother was taken by Vic and his gang. I think they're planning something big.

JASON

I overheard them talking... about a railroad coming through these lands. They want to take it for themselves, no matter who gets hurt.

Jason looks at Emily with newfound determination.

You never listened to me, Jason! I warned you about this place. It's cursed!

JASON

Just a room for the night. And some information.

GIDEON
(laughs)
You're a regular, aren't you? Alright, 5 shillings for the room, and... (leans in)

EMMA
(hands him a coin)
Tell me about the Wolf's Den.

Gideons expression turns serious.

GIDEON
It's not a place for a girl like you. They don't take kindly to outsiders.

EMMA
(pulls out another coin)
I'll pay triple for the information.

Gideon hesitates before speaking in hushed tones:

GIDEON
The Wolf's Den is a private club, run by a man named VICTOR. He's got connections with the highest echelons of society... and the lowest. Rumor has it, he's been known to offer "favors" to those who are willing.

**Act II:**

(Cut to a shadowy alleyway)

Emma sneaks into the Wolf's Den through a hidden entrance. She's met by VICTOR (50s), an imposing figure with piercing eyes.

VICTOR
Welcome, Emma. I hear you're looking for work?

EMMA
(nervously)
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

Victor gestures to a nearby chair.

VICTOR
Good. You'll be working with one of my top men... (calls out)

A figure emerges from the shadows: LYSANDER (30s), a brooding, dark-haired man with a scar above his left eyebrow.

LYSANDER
(smirks)
Victor's got some new blood for me to train. Thought I'd get a say in the matter?

VICTOR
(smirks back)
Sorry, Lyssar. You'll just have to put up with her.

**Act III:**

(Cut to a training session)

Emma is paired with Lysander, who seems reluctant to teach her any skills. They're interrupted by Victor's voice:

VICTOR
Over here!

Victor appears, accompanied by two burly men in black coats.

VICTOR
Lysander, I've got a job for you and your new partner. We'll be... (whispers)

Emma exchanges an uneasy glance with Lysander as the camera pans out to reveal the true nature of the Wolf's Den: a den of thieves, con artists, and assassins.

Jessica enters the library, where we see rows of shelves filled with old, leather-bound books. She walks up to a large, ornate mirror that covers an entire wall.

JESSICA

She approaches the mirror, where we see her reflection staring back at her.

Jessica's reflection begins to fade away, replaced by an image of her younger self (20s), standing in front of a family photograph album.

Jessica looks up at Alice, tears in her eyes.

JESSICA (YOUNG)

The camera zooms in on Jessica's face, her eyes locked onto the wooden box she holds.

JESSICA
(to the camera)
And now, it's time to let go of one final memory...

MARK
Alright, listen up. We've got a situation with one of our own. Agent Rachel Jenkins has gone rogue, and we need to find her before it's too late.

AGENT JENKINS' FILE is on the table in front of Mark. The camera zooms in on the file, which reads "RAISED-LEVEL CLEARANCE" at the top.

MARK (CONT'D)
Rachel was part of the team that uncovered a deep-cover Russian mole within our department. But after the incident with Jenkins' brother... she started asking too many questions.

AGENT JENKINS' PARTNER, SARAH (30s), speaks up.

SARAH
With all due respect, Mark, we didn't know about Rachel's personal life until it was too late. We can't pin this on her alone.

MARK
I'm not saying that, Sarah. But what I am saying is that Agent Jenkins is now a potential threat to national security. And we need to contain the situation before it spirals out of control.

The team begins discussing and debating the best course of action, as Mark interrupts them.

MARK (CONT'D)
Alright, let's get to work. We've got a list of all possible locations Agent Jenkins might be hiding in. I want you all to start canvassing the area immediately.

BLACKJACK looks up as the saloon door swings open and a young woman, SARAH, walks in. She's beautiful, but also clearly scared.

SARAH
(whispering to the bartender)
I need to see Sheriff Johnson.

BARTENDER
(looking at her warily)
What can I do for you, ma'am?

SARAH

Just...can you tell him that Sarah Jenkins is looking for him? Please?

The bartender nods and exits into the back of the saloon. BlackJack watches Sarah with interest.

Blackjack approaches the sheriff's office, a small adobe building on the outskirts of town. He knocks on the door and is greeted by Sheriff JOHNSON (40), a gruff but fair man.

SHERIFF

BLACKJACK
I heard you might have some news about Sarah Jenkins.

The sheriff looks at him warily, but seems to relax slightly.

SHERIFF
That's right. She's been asking questions around town. Trying to find someone.

BLACKJACK
(intently)
Who is she looking for?

SHERIFF
(hesitating)
I'm not sure I should be telling you this...

BLACKJACK
(persuasively)
Just tell me what you know, Sheriff.

The sheriff leans in close and whispers:

SHERIFF
It's about a man named Ryder. He was involved with some...unsavory characters around here. And Sarah seems to think that he might be connected to something bigger.

BlackJack nods thoughtfully as the sheriff continues.

Suddenly, Sarah appears out of nowhere and grabs his arm.

SARAH

You have to listen to me! Ryder's my brother. And he's in danger!

BlackJack looks at her warily, but seems to soften slightly.

MIKE: You mean like, hiking or something?

JASON: No, no! We're talking about... (dramatic pause) ...our backyard!

Elara? You know I'm here for you. Whatever it is...

Kael stops as he sees the look on Elara's face. Her expression turns from contemplation to distress.

ELARA
(turning around, her voice trembling)
It was a dream... or I think so. It felt real enough. The visions came while I meditated last night. A dark force is rising in the north, Kael. One that threatens everything we know.

KAEL
(skeptical)
The North? What's happening there?

Elara gestures to an ancient scroll on her table. 

ELARA
(beside herself)
The prophecy speaks of a darkness older than our understanding of time itself. Something known only as the Devourer, which will consume everything in its path.

Kael steps closer, his brow furrowed with concern.

We'll get to the bottom of it together, Elara. But first...

Elara nods slightly before pointing towards a tapestry hanging at the back of the chamber.

**FADE IN:**

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We see a cluttered apartment, books and papers scattered everywhere. We hear Jessica's (28) voice narrating as she sits on the couch.

JESSICA
(whispering)
I used to be good with my memories. I could recall every detail of every day since childhood. But after...after what happened, things started to get fuzzy.

Jessica looks down at a small notebook in her lap. She flips through the pages, filled with scribbled notes and doodles.

JESSICA (CONT'D)
I started writing everything down. Every conversation, every event, every thought that came into my head. I had to keep track of it all, or risk losing myself completely.

Suddenly, Jessica's eyes widen as she looks up from the notebook.

JESSICA
(whispering urgently)
But then, I started noticing something strange.

Jessica gets up and walks over to a small table in the corner of the room. On it is an old, leather-bound book. She opens it, revealing a page filled with handwritten text.

JESSICA (CONT'D)
These...things...they're not just memories. They're like messages from someone else. Someone who's trying to communicate with me through my own mind.

As Jessica continues to read the message, her eyes start to glaze over and she becomes transfixed. Her voice drops to a whisper.

JESSICA (CONT'D)
It says...it says I'll never be free of it. That this is just the beginning.

Suddenly, Jessica's face contorts in pain and she slams the book shut. She takes a step back, gasping for air.

Jessica looks around the room frantically, as if searching for something that's not there. Then, her eyes land on a small piece of paper on the table next to the notebook.

JESSICA (CONT'D)
What's it trying to tell me? What am I supposed to remember?

She picks up the paper and examines it. It appears to be a cryptic message scrawled in red ink:

"YOU WILL REMEMBER. BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FORGET."

Jessica looks up, her eyes wide with fear.

FADE TO BLACK.

**CUT TO:**

A series of fragmented, surreal sequences, showcasing Jessica's memories and the mysterious messages that are invading them.

* We see snippets of a childhood birthday party, but with a dark, twisted tone.
* A conversation with an unknown person is revealed, where they discuss a plot to erase memories using some sort of mind-altering technology.
* Images of people in hazmat suits, collecting brain tissue and performing gruesome experiments flash on screen.

Each sequence builds upon the previous one, creating a sense of disorientation and unease. We're left questioning what's real, what's just a memory, and who is behind this sinister plot to control Jessica's mind.

FADE TO BLACK.

**CLOSING CREDITS:**

The final shot is of the notebook page with the cryptic message scrawled across it. As the credits roll, the camera zooms out to reveal that the entire episode has been filmed in black and white. Suddenly, the colors bleed back into the image, but only for a moment.

As the credits continue to roll, we're left wondering what exactly Jessica will remember...and what she'll forget.<end>

FADE IN:

EXT. HARRIS STREET - NIGHT

The camera pans over a small suburban street, lined with neat houses and perfectly manicured lawns. We see a group of police officers, led by DETECTIVE JENKINS (40s), gathering outside one of the homes.

CUT TO:

INT. 14 HARRIS STREET - NIGHT

We're inside the home where the police are gathered. It's clear that something terrible has happened here. The walls are splattered with blood and there's a sense of chaos in the air.

Detective Jenkins addresses his team.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
Alright, let's get to work. We've got multiple victims inside. I want you all to search the house and see if we can find any signs of what happened here tonight.

The officers begin to search the home, while Detective Jenkins heads deeper into the house with his partner, DETECTIVE RAMIREZ (30s).

CUT TO:

INT. 14 HARRIS STREET - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Detective Jenkins and Detective Ramirez enter the living room, where they find a young mother, SARAH (25), frantically holding her two children, EMILY (5) and TYLER (3). The air is thick with tension.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
Ma'am, can you tell me what happened here tonight?

SARAH
( sobbing )
It was... it was just a few minutes ago. I heard the noise coming from upstairs. I rushed up to see what was happening and that's when I saw him...

Sarah breaks down in tears, unable to finish her sentence.

CUT TO:

INT. 14 HARRIS STREET - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Detective Jenkins and Detective Ramirez investigate the bedroom where the murder took place. We see a bloody crime scene, with evidence of a violent struggle.

DETECTIVE RAMIREZ
(speaking into his radio)
We've got a possible suspect in custody. Requesting backup to secure the area.

CUT TO:

INT. 14 HARRIS STREET - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Detective Jenkins returns downstairs, looking somber.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
Ma'am, we need you to come with us for questioning.

SARAH
(panicked)
No... no... this can't be happening...

The scene fades to black as the police officers take Sarah away in handcuffs.

CUT TO:

INT. DETECTIVE JENKINS' OFFICE - DAY

Detective Jenkins sits at his desk, looking through the case files. He's joined by Detective Ramirez and another officer, DETECTIVE LEE (40s).

DETECTIVE RAMIREZ
We've got a complex situation here, boss. The victim had a history of domestic abuse... and the suspect's story checks out.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
(skeptical)
Save it for the DA, Ramirez. I want to know what really happened in that house tonight.

Detective Lee chimes in.

DETECTIVE LEE
You've got to consider the possibility that this was a case of self-defense... or even justifiable homicide.

Detective Jenkins looks up at his team.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
We'll get to the bottom of this. But for now, let's focus on finding out what really happened in that house... and making sure justice is served.

FADE TO BLACK.
