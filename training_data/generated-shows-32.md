CUT TO:

INT. EL'GORIN'S INN - DAY

We see a bustling tavern filled with adventurers, traders, and travelers from all corners of the realm. Behind the bar stands the enigmatic innkeeper, EL'GORIN (40s), polishing a mug with a white apron.

EL'GORIN
(to patrons)
Welcome, travelers! I've got just the thing for those looking to get their names on the legendary boards... or lost in the archives, as it were.

A lone figure, EIRA (25), dressed in practical adventuring gear, sits at a table near the fire. She looks out of place among the revelers.

CUT TO:

EXT. AETHORIAN WILDERNESS - DAY

Eira treks through a dense forest, following an ancient map etched on worn parchment. Her footsteps quiet as she navigates the underbrush, tracking a narrow path that leads to...

A hidden entrance behind a cascading waterfall. Eira's eyes light up with excitement.

CUT TO:

INT. LOST CITY - DAY

Eira enters a vast, crystal-lined chamber deep within the city. Awe-inspiring architecture and glowing runes adorn every surface. She approaches a pedestal in the center of the room, where lies...

A glowing artifact: the Eternity Key. Ancient lore whispers that this relic has the power to unlock hidden passages between realms.

CUT TO:

EXT. REALM OF AETHORIA - DAY

As Eira gazes upon the Eternity Key, a sudden burst of energy sends her stumbling backward into the forest. She regains her balance and sees three figures emerge from the trees...

Kael (30), an imposing figure with piercing blue eyes; Mira (22), an agile young woman with an air of quiet confidence; and Arin (50), a battle-hardened veteran with scars to match his years.

KAEL
What's your business here, adventurer?

EIRA
(backtracking)
Just... passing through. I was searching for... uh...

MIRA
(interrupting)
Save it. We've heard rumors of an Eternity Key hidden within Aethoria. You're not the only one after it.

ARIN
(skeptical)
You're on your own, kid. Good luck with that.

JEN: (to herself) Okay, okay... I've got to get out of this one...

Suddenly, her best friend, Rachel, bursts into the apartment, holding up two bottles of wine and a plate of appetizers.

RACHEL:
Hey girl! I'm so excited for tonight's party. We're going to have the best time ever!

JEN:
(smiling nervously) Oh, yeah... I think you might be mistaken, Rach. There's no party.

RACHEL:
(confused) What? No way. You texted me like five times about it. And I brought wine and everything...

Jen looks sheepish as she hands Rachel her phone.

JEN:
(laughing awkwardly) Well... I might have made a mistake. But hey, at least we can still have some wine and appetizers, right?

RACHEL:
(stunned) Jen... what's going on? You've been "fake friending" me all week, haven't you?

Jen looks guilty as she shrugs.

CUT TO:

We see Jen and Rachel sitting at a small table, surrounded by other people they don't know.

RACHEL:
(sarcastically) Oh great. Now we're just hanging out with strangers because I brought wine to a non-existent party...

JEN:
(smiling weakly) Hey... at least the coffee is good, right?

As they try to make small talk with their acquaintances, it becomes clear that everyone there has been "fake friended" by Jen in some way.

Jen is frantically texting on her phone again, this time trying to apologize and explain the situation to all of her fake friends at once.

**Episode Title: "Freshman Frenzy"**

**Act 1:**

INT. LAUGH TRACK HIGH - DAY

We see a montage of students rushing to their first day of school at Laugh Track High, a high school where the entire curriculum revolves around comedy and laughter.

JASON (16), a goofy and enthusiastic freshman, excitedly runs into his locker with his best friend, TOM (17).

JASON: Whoa, dude! First day jitters or what?

TOM: I'm so nervous, I've been practicing my comedy set in front of the mirror for weeks!

Jason chuckles and hands Tom a pamphlet.

JASON: Dude, I got you covered. Check out the school's schedule. We've got "Laughing 101", "Comedy History", and even "Improv Techniques"!

TOM: This is gonna be sick! Let's go crush it!

They high-five each other as they rush off to their first class.

**Act 2:**

CUT TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Jason and Tom take their seats in a crowded classroom for "Laughing 101". The teacher, MR. SNORTON (40s), stands at the front of the room with a goofy grin.

MR. SNORTON: Alright, kids! Welcome to Laughing 101. Today we're going to learn about the art of laughter... and also not getting in trouble for making fart noises with our armpits!

The students erupt into giggles as Jason snickers in the back of the room.

JASON: (whispering to Tom) Dude, I got a great one! *fart noise*

TOM: (giggling) Nice job, Jason!

However, their antics quickly catch the attention of their classmate, LUCY (16), who's trying to take notes for an upcoming test.

LUCY: (irritated) Can you guys please focus? I'm trying to learn here!

JASON: (apologetically) Sorry Lucy! We're just... *clears throat* "getting into character" for the comedy sketch we have to perform next week.

Lucy rolls her eyes as Jason and Tom continue to crack each other up.

**Act 3:**

Jason, Tom, and Lucy run into each other during their lunch break.

LUCY: (teasingly) So, I heard you guys are performing a comedy sketch next week? Want some tips?

TOM: (excitedly) Oh, yeah! We're gonna kill it!

JASON: (confidently) Yeah, we've been practicing our "improv techniques"... and also making up some new ones as we go along!

Lucy chuckles and playfully shakes her head.

LUCY: Well, I'm sure you guys will do great. But if you need any help, just come to me. I'm basically a comedy genius now...

The three friends share a hearty laugh as the camera cuts to:

**Act 4:**

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

Jason and Tom's comedy sketch, "Laugh Track High", comes to life on stage. The two friends bring their energy and antics to the audience.

As they improvise and make each other laugh, Jason trips over his own feet and face-plants into a nearby trash can.

TOM: (laughing) Nice catch, Jason! You're like a human garbage disposal!

JASON: (groaning) That was supposed to be a punchline...

The audience erupts into laughter as the friends take their final bow. The camera zooms out to show the entire school cheering and applauding.

We see the Darkstar Guardians: MAX (30s, former special forces operative), LUNA (20s, genius hacker and tech-whiz), ZEPHYR (40s, retired pilot with enhanced strength and agility), and KAI (20s, young, charismatic telepath).

MAX
(serious tone)
Alright, we've got a situation. Intel suggests the Order of the Black Sun is planning to strike tonight.

LUNA
(typing away on her phone)
Already on it, Max. I'm hacking into their servers now.

ZEPHYR
(nodding)
I'll get the chopper ready.

KAI
(close his eyes, focusing)
I'll see if I can tap into their comms network.

Suddenly, Kai's eyes snap open and he nods to himself.

KAI
(focused)
Got it. They're coordinating with a rogue faction in the old warehouse district.

MAX
(nodding)
Alright, let's gear up. We've got a city to protect.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

The Darkstar Guardians leap out of their helicopter and hit the ground running. They dash through alleys and side streets, following Kai's mental map of the Black Sun's operations.

As they approach the warehouse, gunfire erupts from within.

MAX
(grinning)
Time to get to work.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The Darkstar Guardians burst into the warehouse, guns blazing. They fight their way through henchmen and take down high-ranking members of the Black Sun.

Meanwhile, Luna takes control of the Black Sun's systems, causing their own equipment to turn against them.

ZEPHYR
(whooping)
Yeah!

KAI
(focused)
Almost got them all...

Suddenly, a massive, heavily-armed figure emerges from the shadows: VICTOR VANDAAL (50s, former mad scientist turned supervillain).

VANDAAL
(sneering)
You think you can stop me? I have created an army of nanobots, and together we will take this city by storm!

MAX
(grinning)
Not if we have anything to say about it.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The Darkstar Guardians fight off the swarm of nanobots, with Zephyr using his enhanced strength to hold back the tide.

Meanwhile, Kai uses his telepathy to disrupt Vandaal's mental interface with the nanobots.

MAX

**INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY**

We see a mock-up of a film set, with cameras and lights scattered everywhere. We hear the sound of chaos in the background.

**JIM (played by Pete Holmes)**, a flustered production assistant, rushes around trying to keep everything under control.

**JIM**
(to an off-camera PA)
Okay, where's the script? Where's the schedule?

**PA**
(sheepishly)
I think it got lost in the prop department, Jim.

**JIM**
(exasperated)
Of course it did. Because that's exactly what we need right now - a missing script and a crew that's about to have a nervous breakdown.

Suddenly, **DIRECTOR MIKE (played by Will Sasso)** bursts onto the set, wearing a ridiculous outfit.

**MIKE**
(excitedly)
Okay, people! Let's get this show on the road!

**JIM**
(sarcastically)
Oh, joy. Because nothing says "good filmmaking" like a director who thinks he's in a 90s music video.

The crew starts to murmur and get restless.

**MIKE**
(to Jim)
What's going on here?

**JIM**
(exasperated)
Nothing, Mike. Just the usual chaos that comes with working for you.

**MIKE**
(offended)
Hey, I'm a visionary! I've made some of the most iconic films of our time!

**JIM**
(drolly)
Oh yeah? Like what?

**MIKE**
(proudly)
"Zombie Accountants from Space" - it was a cult classic, if you will.

The crew starts to snicker and snort.

**JIM**
(smirking)
Yeah, because nothing says "cult classic" like a film about zombie accountants from space.

**PA**
(jumping in)
Hey, guys! Let's get back to work!

The crew starts to disperse and the cameras begin to roll. Jim rolls his eyes and mutters under his breath.

**JIM**

This is gonna be a long day...

Cut to:

**INT. TRAILER - DAY**

Jim is sitting in the trailer, trying to catch a break. Suddenly, **LUCY (played by Chelsea Peretti)** bursts in.

**LUCY**
(excitedly)
Hey, Jim! I just got a new hat!

She holds up a ridiculous-looking hat that looks like it was made from leftover Christmas decorations.

**JIM**
(sarcastically)
Oh, great. Because what this production really needed was a hat.

Lucy starts to prance around the trailer, wearing the hat.

**LUCY**
(proudly)
I'm going to be a character actress! I'm going to make it big in Hollywood!

Jim shakes his head and tries to ignore her.

Cut to:

**EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY**

The cameras are still rolling, but everything is falling apart. The crew is at each other's throats, the actors can't remember their lines, and Mike is running around like a chicken with its head cut off.

Suddenly, **JIM**
(frustrated)
That's it! I've had enough!

He storms onto the set, microphone in hand.

**JIM**
(into the mic)
We're never going to finish this film at this rate. We're never going to get out of here alive!

The crew starts to murmur and chant "Jim! Jim!" as he walks off the set.

**Act I:**

We see a small, isolated radio station in the middle of nowhere. It's a cramped room with two employees, JEN (30s) and TOM (40s), huddled around a desk.

JEN
(whispering)
Alright, we've got to be careful. The signal is weak.

TOM
(nervously)
I know, I know. But this is it. This is our chance.

Jen hands Tom a piece of paper with a cryptic message scrawled on it.

JEN
(explaining)
This is the coordinates for...you know.

TOM
(looking at the paper)
Yeah. I remember.

Suddenly, the lights in the room flicker and then go out. The radio equipment beeps erratically.

**Act II:**

As the darkness envelops them, Jen and Tom stumble around the room, trying to find a flashlight or candles. They finally manage to light some candles and see each other for the first time since the power went out.

TOM
(alarmed)
What was that?

JEN
(shrugging)
I don't know. Must have been a storm.

As they wait in the darkness, strange noises begin to echo through the room - creaks, groans, and faint whispers. Tom starts to get spooked.

**Act III:**

The whispers grow louder and more urgent. Jen tries to reassure Tom that it's just their imagination, but he's having none of it. Suddenly, a loud crash echoes through the room, followed by an eerie silence.

Jen cautiously gets up and approaches a window. She pushes aside the curtains and gazes out into the night.

**Act IV:**

We see Jen staring at something in the distance - a figure walking towards the radio station. The camera zooms out to reveal that it's not just one person, but multiple figures, all dressed in some sort of uniform.

Jen turns back to Tom, who's cowering in the corner of the room.

TOM
(terrified)
What is it? What do you see?

Jen doesn't answer. She simply stares at him with a look of dread.

INT. CASTLE THRONE ROOM - DAY

King EDWARD (40s), a sturdy man with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, sits on his throne, flanked by his advisors: LORD THOMAS and BISHOP RALPH. The room is dimly lit, with only a few candles illuminating the space.

KING EDWARD
( grave concern etched on his face )
My lords, I fear for our kingdom's future. The crops have failed twice in a row, and our people are growing restless. We must act swiftly to avoid catastrophe.

LORD THOMAS
(nodding solemnly)
Your Majesty is right. Perhaps we can...

BISHOP RALPH
(interrupting )
Forgive me, my king, but I fear there's more at play here than just the weather. I've had whispers of a traitor within our walls.

KING EDWARD

A traitor? Who would dare?

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

We see a young woman, MARY (20s), walking down the hallway with her loyal lady-in-waiting, ELIZABETH. Mary is beautiful, with long, curly brown hair and piercing green eyes.

I fear I may have overstepped my bounds, Elizabeth. Father's advisors seem to be in a bind, and I've heard them speaking of... darker things.

ELIZABETH
(frowning)

The fate of our kingdom weighs heavily on me, but I fear for the lives of those we hold dear. There's something brewing, Elizabeth. Something we shouldn't ignore.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE GARDEN - DAY

Mary sits beneath a tree, watching as her brother, TOM (20s), trains with a pair of burly guards. Tom is strong and confident, but there's an air of desperation about him.

MARY
(voice barely above a whisper )
Tom, please be careful. There are things we shouldn't speak of... not even among ourselves.

TOM

Don't worry, sis. I can handle myself. Besides...

He leans in close, and Mary's eyes widen as she realizes what he might reveal.

CUT TO:

INT. CIRCUS - TENT - NIGHT

We meet our protagonist, JESS (28), a shy and introverted woman who works as a face painter at the carnival. She's always been fascinated by the art of painting and is skilled in her craft.

As she finishes painting a child's smile onto their cheek, Jess notices a peculiar old man standing on the outskirts of the tent. He's dressed in a faded suit with a top hat, and his eyes seem to gleam with an otherworldly intensity.

JESS: (whispering to herself) Who is that guy?

CUT TO:

INT. CIRCUS - MIDWAY - NIGHT

Jess takes a break from work and wanders through the midway, taking in the sights and sounds of the carnival. She stops at a booth run by a fortune teller, Madame Zora (60s), who claims to possess psychic abilities.

MADAME ZORA:
(sly smile)
Welcome, dear one. I see you've been searching for something...

Jess leans in, curious about the fortune teller's words.

JESS:

You know, some people say this place is cursed...

Jess chuckles but can't shake off the feeling that something strange is lurking just beneath the surface.

EXT. CIRCUS - NIGHT

As the night wears on, Jess becomes increasingly unsettled by the old man's presence and Madame Zora's ominous words. She starts to feel like she's losing her grip on reality.

JESS:

No...

MAXWELL WYLES:

You should have listened, little one... now it's your turn to smile...

INT. SAMARKAND PALACE - DAY

Jawhara stands before her father, the powerful Sultan Muhammad II. He sits on a lavish throne, adorned with precious jewels and silks.

SULTAN MUHAMMAD
(serious)
Jawahra, my daughter, our merchants have been reporting a surge in demand for high-quality silk from China. I want you to travel along the Silk Road, negotiate trade agreements with Chinese officials, and bring back the finest silks to adorn my throne.

JAWAHRA
(curious)
Father, what's the real reason behind this sudden interest in Chinese silk?

SULTAN MUHAMMAD
(pained expression)
It's simple, Jawahra. The Silk Road is shifting. Empires are rising and falling. We must secure our position as a major power in the region.

JAWHARA
(determined)
I'll not only bring back the finest silks but also forge alliances that will solidify our place on this sacred road.

Jawhara sits beside her loyal servant, ARIA (25), a skilled horseback rider and warrior.

ARIA
(concerned)
Your Highness, I don't like this one bit. The Sultan's instructions were clear: you're to go as a merchant, not as royalty.

JAWHARA
(calmly)
We'll take the risk. My father wants me to succeed; he needs us to thrive in these changing times.

ARIA
(resolute)
Then let's ride, Your Highness. We'll brave this unforgiving road together.

CUT TO:

As Jawhara and Aria set out on their journey, they're met with breathtaking vistas of snow-capped mountains, vast deserts, and lush forests.

As Jawhara and Aria rest for the night, they're approached by a hooded figure from their own caravan.

HOODED FIGURE

Your Highness... Your father may not have told you everything about the Silk Road's new power brokers. Be cautious; there are those who'd stop at nothing to claim its riches for themselves.

JAWHARA
(interested)
And what do you know of these power brokers?

HOODED FIGURE
(serious)
The Chinese Emperor himself is rumored to be seeking alliances, forging his own path on the Silk Road. You'll need to tread carefully if you hope to secure our kingdom's position in this new era.

JAWHARA

Gather 'round, my friends. I have called you here to discuss a matter of grave import. Our scouts report that the dark sorcerer, Malakar, has been spotted within our borders.

ADVISOR 1 (LYRA)
Her eyes are wide with concern.
My lord, this is not good news. If he's managed to infiltrate...

KAELIN
(interrupting)
I know, Lyra. But I have a plan. We will send our best warriors to track him down and put an end to his dark magic once and for all.

ADVISOR 2 (THANE)
A burly man with a thick beard.
My lord, are you certain this is wise? Malakar's powers are said to be formidable...

KAELIN

I am certain. We cannot let fear dictate our actions. We will show him the true strength of House Ironwood.

Kaelin, Lyra, and Thane stand before a large, ornate mirror in the armory. A reflection of Kaelin appears on its surface.

KAELIN

The prophecy speaks of an Ironwood who will wield the sword of light against darkness. I believe that sword is mine to wield.

LYRA
(concerned)
Kaelin, you know what happens when we speak of such things...

KAELIN
(firmly)
I do, Lyra. But sometimes, a man must face his destiny head-on.

THANE
(skeptical)
And what if this prophecy is not true? What if it's just a myth meant to keep us in line?

Kaelin turns to Thane, his eyes blazing with determination.

KAELIN
(unequivocally)
Then I will forge my own path. For House Ironwood, for the people of our realm... and for myself.

The reflection on the mirror begins to shimmer and fade away as Kaelin raises his hand.

ZARA
(to her second-in-command, Commander ARIN)
"All hands, we're approaching the Kaelin Sector. Our mission is to escort the refugee convoy through this sector, and ensure their safe passage to New Eden."

ARIN
(serious)
"Ma'am, our sensors are picking up strange energy signatures emanating from a nearby planet. We should investigate before proceeding with the evacuation."

JACK

Ryder. It's been a while.

RYDER

Jack McCoy. I didn't know you were back in these parts.

JACK
(hands on hips)
I'm not "back." I've just arrived. Word is, there's some trouble brewin' around here.

RYDER

Jack nods, understanding the problem.

We see the Red Rock gang, led by the cunning and ruthless, CASSIDY (30s). They're a motley crew of outlaws, armed to the teeth.

Well, well, well. If it isn't Jack McCoy and his little friend Ryder.

Jack steps forward, his hand resting on the grip of his gun.

JACK
(firmly)
We've come to put a stop to your antics, Cassidy.

Cassidy smirks, a glint in his eye.

CASSIDY
(suddenly cold)
I'm afraid you're too late for that. We've got a buyer lined up. A wealthy investor who's willing to pay top dollar for our... services.

Jack's face darkens with anger.

JACK

It's been three days since the anomaly. Three days since time itself began to unravel.

Suddenly, her comms device beeps. She answers it.

ARIA
(into comms device)
Kael, what have you got for me?

KAEL (V.O.)
Aria, I've pinpointed the source of the anomaly. It's a small warehouse on the outskirts of Manhattan.

ARIA
(nodding to herself)
Alright, I'm on my way.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Aria sneaks into the abandoned warehouse, her eyes scanning for any sign of danger. She spots a group of armed men, led by a hooded figure.

ARIA

This must be the Time Reavers.

HOOKEY FIGURE (VOICE MODULATED)
Welcome, Timekeeper. We've been expecting you.

ARIA
(smirking)
You're not even from this timeline, are you?

HOODED FIGURE
(laughing menacingly)
Oh, no. I'm from a time yet to come.

Aria charges into battle, her fists flying as she takes down the armed men. The hooded figure pulls out a device and presses a button.

No! You can't do that!

The warehouse begins to distort and blur around Aria, as if reality itself is unraveling.

Aria and Kael track down the hooded figure, now revealed as a woman named TEMPER (28), who has arrived from a post-apocalyptic future.

The two engage in an epic battle, with Aria using her Timekeeper abilities to manipulate time itself. Temper retaliates with advanced technology from her own timeline.

CUT TO:

As the sun rises over the city, Aria and Temper stand facing each other, exhausted but unbroken.

ARIA
(panting)
You're right. I won't be able to stop you. But I'll do everything in my power to delay you.

TEMPER
(smirking)
That's...admirable.

Suddenly, a massive explosion rocks the ground beneath their feet. The two women stumble back as the city around them begins to distort and blur once more.

ARIA
(warned)
No! You've created another anomaly!

We see JESSICA (22), a friendly and charming young woman, scooping ice cream behind the counter of her family's beloved ice cream shop. She's on summer break from college and working to save up for next semester.

Jessica chats with regular customer, MIKE (28), a rugged outdoorsman who stops by every night after his shift at the local fishing camp.

MIKE
(smirking)
You know, Jess, I'm starting to think your ice cream is too good. It's like you're trying to distract me from my problems.

JESSICA
(laughing)
Hey, someone's got to take your mind off things! Besides, a scoop of strawberry cheesecake can fix anything.

Mike chuckles and takes his cone, which he eats while walking out the door.

Jessica watches him leave, then turns back to her work. As she scoops another customer's ice cream, we see flashbacks of her summer so far: lazy days by the pool with friends, beach bonfires on stormy nights, and long drives with Mike along winding coastal roads.

Jessica meets up with her best friend, LUCY (21), who's been studying for med school all summer. They sit on a bench, watching the stars come out.

Okay, one more day until payday...

Suddenly, the door swings open and in walks TOM, the owner of the adjacent pet store, "Tom's Treats".

TOM
Hey, Jen! How's business?

JEN
(sarcastically)
Oh, you know. Just trying to make ends meet while the big coffee chains suck all the life out of this neighborhood.

TOM
(laughing)
Well, at least we have each other!

The two friends chat for a bit about their respective businesses and the struggles they face as small business owners in the area.

Her accountant agrees and they make a plan. As Jen hangs up the phone, she looks around the empty coffee shop and sighs.

Jen steps outside into the bright sunlight and takes a deep breath. She looks out at the bustling neighborhood and smiles.

Not yet, Sarah. We need to get out of here before it's too late.

You would have liked this, Father...

Suddenly, Lord Ryker, the king's trusted advisor and Arin's mentor, enters the throne room.

LORD RYKER
Crown Prince... it is time we spoke of your duties as heir. The kingdom will not rule itself.

ARIN

Yes, Lord Ryker. I know my responsibilities. But first...

Lord Ryker briefs Arin on the current state of affairs: the Kraelion Empire, still reeling from King Eriol's victory, is amassing forces to retake their conquered territories. Meanwhile, the northern provinces are restive, demanding greater autonomy and representation in Asharian politics.

LORD RYKER
Your father knew that maintaining peace would be an impossible task, yet he held fast to his vision for a unified Asharia. Now it falls to you...

Arin steps out into the sunlight, the weight of his decision pressing down upon him. He is joined by two confidants: Lady Lirien, the beautiful and cunning sister-in-law who wields significant influence at court; and Lord Arcturus, a battle-hardened warrior who has fought alongside King Eriol in countless battles.

LADY LIRIEN
The kingdom's fate will be decided by your hand alone, Crown Prince. Will you choose war or wisdom?

ARCTURUS

War is the only way to truly secure our future... at least, if we're being honest with ourselves.

ARIN

Perhaps there's another path...

The moon's alignment... it's different this time. A convergence of energies...

Suddenly, Elara's eyes snap towards the sky. She gasps as a comet streaks across the horizon.

ARIN
(concerned)
Elara? Your focus!

ELARA
(distraught)
The prophecy! It must be true.

CUT TO:

INT. ARIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Arin and Elara sit by a roaring fire, poring over ancient texts. Arin explains the legend of the Moonlit Prophecy.

ARIN (V.O.)
When the celestial bodies align just so... the chosen one will emerge. A force to tip the balance between light and darkness...

ELARA
(awed)
I'm the one... I've been feeling it my whole life!

CUT TO:

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Elara's village is in chaos. The once-peaceful residents are now arguing over resources, fueled by a growing darkness within themselves.

VILLAGER 1
(frantically)
We must prepare for the worst! Our crops wither... our livestock fall ill...

ELARA
(attempting to intervene)
No, please! There's another way!

The villagers turn on Elara, accusing her of being foolish and naive. She realizes she must flee.

CUT TO:

EXT. WILDLIFE RESERVE - DAY

Elara finds herself back at the reserve, standing before Arin. He's gone, but a note lies beside him.

ELARA
(reads)
"Find the Oracle. You'll know what to do."

Elara looks up at the sky, now filled with an ominous storm. She knows her journey has just begun.

We see KAIDEN (28), a brooding young man with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair, huddled around a small fire. He's surrounded by a collection of ancient texts and strange artifacts.

KAIDEN
(whispering to himself)
It has been 12 years since the Great Calamity...since the gods turned to dust...

Suddenly, a gust of wind blows through the camp, extinguishing the flames. Kai looks up to see a figure cloaked in shadows standing at the entrance of his tent.

KAIDEN
(alarmed)
Who are you?

The figure steps forward, revealing a striking woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair - LYSANDRA (28).

LYSANDRA
My name is not important. What's yours?

KAIDEN
I'm Kai...Kaiden of the Duskborn clan.

LYSANDRA
(her eyes gleaming with intensity)
Ah, yes. I've heard of your people. They were once revered as oracles, but now they're all but forgotten.

(skeptical)
What do you want from me?

LYSANDRA
(her voice laced with urgency)
I'm looking for a piece of knowledge...a prophecy that was hidden away by your people. A prophecy that could change the course of history...

Kai hesitates, unsure if he can trust this enigmatic woman.

ELIAS
(serious)
The Duskborn were chosen to be guardians of knowledge...to keep the flame of civilization burning in a world gone mad...

Kai looks up at Elias with wide eyes, sensing the weight of responsibility placed upon him.

CUT TO:

INT. KAI'S CAMP - DAY

Lysandra's presence has stirred something within Kai. He begins to open up about his people's history and their role in the ancient world.

KAIDEN
( resolute)
I remember...my mentor told me that our clan was meant to keep a secret safe, not reveal it...

LYSANDRA
(determined)
You're right...the prophecy is too important to be kept hidden. We need your help, Kai...

Kai looks at Lysandra with newfound determination.

Okay, okay. You can both take turns later. Let's just eat our breakfast for now, okay?

As they finish eating, Jen glances at her watch and realizes she has a meeting at the PTA in 20 minutes.

JEN
(apologetically)
Guys, I have to run. Can you guys get ready for school on your own today? Mommy's got a meeting.

(pouting)
But we're not even done with our show!
