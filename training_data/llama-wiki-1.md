3. **Total eclipse**: The Moon completely covers the Sun, revealing its outer atmosphere (corona).

**Types of Solar Eclipses**

Solar eclipses are further divided into two types based on their frequency:

1. **Hybrid solar eclipse**: A rare type of eclipse that appears as a total eclipse in some areas and an annular eclipse in others.
2. **Annular or partial solar eclipse**: These eclipses occur when the Moon is at a farther distance from the Earth.

**Safety During Solar Eclipses**

It's essential to protect your eyes during a solar eclipse:

* Never look directly at the Sun without proper eye protection, such as specialized solar viewing glasses.
* Use pinhole projectors or handheld solar viewers to safely observe the eclipse.

Write a wiki article about Black hole.<start>**Black Hole**

A black hole is a place in space where gravity is very strong. It pulls everything towards it, including light.

**What happens when matter gets close to a black hole?**

When something like a star or planet gets close to a black hole, its gravity pulls it in. The black hole sucks up all the material and does not let anything escape. This makes the object disappear from our sight.

**How is a black hole created?**

A black hole is formed when a massive star explodes. This explosion creates such strong gravity that nothing can escape. If the star was very heavy, it becomes a black hole.

**Characteristics of Black Holes**

* They are invisible because their gravity pulls in all light.
* They have strong gravity that pulls everything towards them.
* They are usually found at the center of galaxies or stars.
* Their size can vary greatly, from small to super-massive.

**Types of Black Holes**

There are four types of black holes:

1. **Stellar Black Hole**: The smallest type, formed when a star explodes.
2. **Intermediate-Mass Black Hole**: A bit bigger than stellar black holes.
3. **Supermassive Black Hole**: Found at the center of galaxies and very large in size.

**Interesting Facts**

* Scientists have not been able to observe black holes directly because they are invisible.
* We can see their effects on surrounding matter, like stars or planets getting pulled towards them.
* The event horizon is the point around a black hole where gravity becomes so strong that nothing can escape.
