"What are you thinking about?" Yvette asked, looking at Alex with a curious expression.

"I was just watching that plane flying overhead," Alex replied. "But now I'm thinking about Halley's Comet."

"Halley's Comet? What about it?" Yvette asked, interested.

"You know, it's one of the most famous comets in history," Alex said. "It comes around once every 76 years and is visible from Earth for only a short time. The last time it was seen was in 1986."

"That's cool!" Yvette exclaimed. "I remember hearing about that. But I didn't know it came back so often."

"Exactly! It's really rare," Alex said. "And scientists think it will come by again in 2061. Some people might get to see it, but not everyone will be alive at the same time as its next visit."

Yvette nodded thoughtfully. She loved learning about new things and this was definitely interesting.

"What do you think it would be like to see Halley's Comet?" Yvette asked Alex.

"I think it would be amazing!" Alex replied. "Just imagine seeing a bright light in the sky, knowing that it's from so far away. It's like a little piece of space history right above us."

Yvette smiled at her friend's enthusiasm. They sat in silence for a moment, watching the waves roll by and imagining what it would be like to see Halley's Comet.

"Hey, let's make a wish," Yvette said suddenly, looking up at the sky.

"What should we wish for?" Alex asked with a grin.

"I think we should wish that we get to see Halley's Comet together in 2061," Yvette replied, smiling hopefully.

As they talked, a few birds flew overhead, singing softly.

"I think what I liked most," Ricardo said, "was the food. Polish pierogies are some of my favorite things to eat."

Sofia laughed. "You're always talking about food, aren't you?"

Ricardo grinned. "Maybe so."

Emily pointed at a green area on the globe. "What about that part?"

Ruth smiled. "That's Asia! It's the largest continent and has many different cultures. Then we have Australia, which is all by itself as an island continent."

The two friends continued to explore the globe together. Ruth showed Emily Europe, North America, and South America, explaining a little bit about each one.

Ervin snorted. "Sounds like a great problem to have."

The three sat in comfortable silence for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts about Vermont.

Antoinette broke the silence, looking up at Mark. "Do you think you'll go back anytime soon?"

Luca thought for a moment before speaking up. "I think tigers are just really powerful animals. Have you guys seen any good documentaries about them?"

Lola shook her head. "No, I haven't. But now you've got me interested!"
