Write a wiki article about Halley's Comet.<start>**Halley's Comet**

Halley's Comet is a famous comet that appears in our sky every 76 years. It was named after English astronomer Edmond Halley, who first predicted its return in 1758.

**What is a Comet?**

A comet is a small, icy body that orbits the Sun. Comets are made of dust and frozen gases, like water and methane. When a comet gets close to the Sun, the heat from the Sun melts the ice, creating a bright tail of gas and dust that we can see in our sky.

**History of Halley's Comet**

Halley's Comet was first seen by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC. It appeared again in 1066 AD and was associated with the death of King Harold of England at the Battle of Hastings. The comet was later observed in 1456, 1531, and 1607.

**Edmond Halley's Prediction**

In 1705, Edmond Halley studied the paths of previous comets to see if he could predict when one would return. He found that three comets seen in 1337, 1479, and 1554 were actually the same comet. Based on this, he predicted that the comet would return between July 15 and August 15, 1758.

**Appearance of Halley's Comet**

Halley's Comet appears as a small, fuzzy ball with a bright tail of gas and dust. The comet is usually visible to the naked eye for about six weeks. In 1986, the comet was seen by millions of people around the world after its last appearance in 1910.

**Interesting Facts**

* Halley's Comet is one of the most famous comets in history.
* The comet has a nucleus (central body) that is only about 5 miles (8 kilometers) long and 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) wide.
