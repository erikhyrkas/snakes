INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see a cluttered coffee shop, with people typing away on their laptops and chatting with friends. We zoom in on our protagonist, JESSICA (28), a quirky and lovable woman who works as a freelance writer.

JESSICA: (to the barista) Just a cappuccino, please. And make it snappy!

BARISTA: (smirking) Coming right up. You know, you look familiar. Have we met before?

JESSICA: (laughing) I doubt it. I'm just a face in this coffee shop crowd.

The barista hands Jessica her cappuccino and she takes a sip as she checks her phone.

JESSICA: (to herself) Ugh, another rejection email from my writing agent. I swear, they hate me.

Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks our other main character, MAX (30), a charming but slightly awkward guy who looks like he just rolled out of bed.

MAX: (spotting Jessica) Oh, hey! You're that writer chick from the coffee shop blog, right?

JESSICA: (surprised) Uh, yeah. That's me.

MAX: (excitedly) I'm Max! We met online a few weeks ago... on that dating app thingy. (he holds up his phone)

Jessica looks taken aback as she processes the information.

JESSICA: (trying to play it cool) Oh, yeah. We talked about our shared love of pizza and bad puns.

MAX: (grinning) That's right! And I have to say, you're even more beautiful in person!

Jessica blushes as Max awkwardly tries to take a selfie with her.

MAX: (plopping himself down on the couch) Oh, no way! I had to meet you in person. And I have to say... your apartment is even more amazing than I expected!

Jessica gives him a look as he starts to explore her living space.

JESSICA: (laughing) Yeah, it's pretty messy, huh?

MAX: (impressed) No way! This is like a museum of awesome. You're like the human version of Pinterest!

Jessica and Max are sitting on a blanket, eating sandwiches and laughing together.

JESSICA: (smiling) I have to say, you're not as weird as I thought online.

A young woman, ERIKA (25), stands before a grand stone throne, adorned with intricate carvings of Viking gods and goddesses. She is dressed in a simple but elegant woolen gown, her hair tied back in a practical knot.

ERIKA: (whispering to herself) It's been two years since the raiders took our lands, killed my family... I'm all that's left.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows. He is KJETIL (30), a ruggedly handsome warrior with a scar above his eyebrow and a confident air about him.

KJETIL: (approaching Erika) You shouldn't be here, Princess. It's not safe.

ERIKA: (looking up at Kjetil with a mix of fear and determination) I had to come. Father left me in charge when he went to seek allies against the raiders... but I have no one to turn to now that he's gone.

KJETIL: (sighing) Alright, listen. I've heard rumors of a Viking lord who's gathering his forces to take on the raiders. We might be able to find an ally there.

ERIKA: (nodding quickly) Yes! That's what Father was trying to do... he said we could defeat them if we stood together!

KJETIL: (eyeing Erika warily) I'll help you, Princess... but you need to understand the risks. We may not make it out alive.

ERIKA: (firmly) I'm willing to take that risk. For Winterfell. For my family's memory.

Erika and Kjetil, along with a small group of warriors, trudge through the snow-covered terrain, their breath visible in the cold air.

The camera pans across a bustling tent filled with fierce-looking warriors, their faces illuminated by candles and fires. Erika and Kjetil approach the center of the tent, where the Viking lord, OLAF (40), sits on a throne-like chair.

OLAF: (looking down at Erika) You're from Winterfell? I heard your lands were... taken?

ERIKA: (nodding, her eyes welling up with tears) Yes... and my family was killed. But we will not be defeated so easily!

OLAF: (impressed) Ah, Princess, you have spirit! And a desire to take back what's yours? I can help you. For a price.

KJETIL: (moving forward, hand on the hilt of his sword) What kind of price?

OLAF: (grinning) Ah, but that would be telling... for now. Let us discuss this further over a feast and some ale!

Come on, Emily. You know I can handle it. Give me something.

Detective Warden hesitates for a moment before speaking in a hushed tone.

JESSICA
We've been doing this for years. We know what people like. Why not just do something we love, and see where it takes us?

Yeah, I'm at the market with Obaachan... Yeah, we're doing all right! You should come visit us soon!

Dude, you won't believe what happened last week.

MIKE
(skeptical)
Try me.

JASON
(proudly)
Okay, so I decided to make tacos for Taco Tuesday. I mean, it's a classic, right?

MIKE
(laughing)
Yeah, because nothing says "Tuesday" like tacos.

JASON
(ignoring Mike's sarcasm)
So, I'm cooking away, and I realize I've got no onions or cilantro. No big deal, right? I just sub in some... (he checks a note on the fridge) ...dill pickles and parsley from my grandma's funeral dinner.

MIKE
(incredulous)
What?

JASON

Yeah, I figured it was close enough. And let me tell you, those dill pickles added a whole new level to the tacos.

Jason is on the phone with his mom, who is clearly fed up with his antics.

JASON

Mom, I told you, it was just an accident! The pickles were a legitimate substitute!

MOM (V.O.)
Over the phone)
Accident? Jason, you put dill pickles and parsley from my funeral dinner in your tacos. That's not an accident, that's a crime scene.

Please don't believe her, Detective. I'm telling you the truth.

RYAN
(skeptical)
I'll do my job, Jessica. But if there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that people lie. And usually for good reason.

Her apprentice, Kael, a young man in his early 20s with short black hair and an intense gaze, observes from a nearby console.

PROFESSOR ARKEIA
( hands clasped behind her back )
The Eternity Protocol has been breached, Kael. I fear the consequences will be catastrophic.

KAEL
(concerned)
How did this happen, Professor? The safeguards were meant to prevent...

ARKEIA
(interrupting)
That's what I've been trying to figure out. Someone - or something - has exploited a weakness in our temporal defenses. The Protocol was designed to preserve the timeline, but now... (she trails off, lost in thought)

Suddenly, the laboratory is shaken by an intense tremor. The holographic display flickers and dies.

ARKEIA
(alarmed)
What's happening?

KAEL
(scanning the console)
It's a resonance wave! The Eternity Protocol's collapse has created a ripple effect through time!

As the lab continues to shake, Arkeia rushes to the console. She frantically inputs commands, trying to stabilize the situation.

ARKEIA
(to Kael)
We need to find the source of this disturbance and repair the timeline before it's too late.

KAEL
(resolute)
I'll hack into the city's mainframe and see if I can pinpoint the cause.

EXT. AETHON'S STREETS - DAY

A group of civilians, including a young woman named Lyra, flee in terror as strange, ghostly apparitions begin to materialize around them. These spectral entities seem to be echoes from different timelines, drawn into our reality by the collapse of the Eternity Protocol.

LYRA
(terrified)
What's happening? Why are they here?

A street vendor, caught up in the chaos, points toward a figure standing at the edge of the crowd.

VENDOR
(frightened)
Look! It's... it's Professor Arkeia!

Arkeia, clad in a sleek black jumpsuit and carrying an energy shield, pushes her way through the panicked crowd. She scans the area with an expression of grim determination.

ARKEIA
(to Kael, over comms)
I'm heading into the heart of the distortion. Can you keep tracking the source?

KAEL
(nervously)
Roger that, Professor. I'll try to pinpoint its location.

As Arkeia disappears into the swirling chaos, Lyra turns to Kael and asks:

LYRA
(serious)
You have any idea what's going on? What those things are?

Kael hesitates before responding, a hint of foreboding in his voice:

But what about the safe house? We can't just leave it behind.

MARCUS
(grimly)
The safe house was overrun last night. I saw them myself.

LENA
(whispering)
Mom...

Jax's expression softens as he kneels beside Lena, who's clutching a small stuffed animal to her chest.

JAX
(gently)
It's okay, kiddo. We'll find another place to hide.

The group begins to gather their meager belongings and prepare for departure.

CUT TO:

EXT. POST-APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND - DAY

As the group moves through the ruins of civilization, they're ambushed by a swarm of infected humans - once people now twisted into monstrous, flesh-eating creatures.

SARAH
(screaming)
No! Get away from me!

The group fights for their lives as the horde closes in. Jax takes point, dispatching infected with brutal efficiency.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY

The survivors stumble into a makeshift farm, where they find a small cache of food and water. As they rest and tend to their wounds, we see flashbacks of the apocalypse: nuclear fallout, massive earthquakes, and societal collapse.

Jax's story is revealed in fragmented glimpses: he was a soldier who lost his unit during the initial outbreak; Sarah was a nurse who tried to save as many people as possible before the world fell apart; Marcus fought in a war that prepared him for nothing; and Lena's mom died protecting her from an infected.

As they recover, Jax reveals a hidden stash of medical supplies and a plan to reach a supposed safe haven: an underground bunker known as "The Sanctuary".

CUT TO:

EXT. POST-APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND - DAY

The group sets out once more, determined to reach The Sanctuary. As they journey through the treacherous landscape, we see glimpses of other survivors struggling to stay alive.

Jax's resolve is tested when the group encounters a massive horde of infected, blocking their path to The Sanctuary. With nowhere else to go and nothing left to lose, Jax makes an impossible choice:

JAX
(determined)
We go through them.

EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

The camera pans over a futuristic cityscape, towering skyscrapers and neon lights stretching as far as the eye can see. But something feels off.

CUT TO:

INT. PSYCHOSPHERE LABORATORIES - DAY

We see JAX (28), a brilliant but rebellious scientist, working on a top-secret project in a high-tech lab. He's surrounded by holographic displays and data streaming from various devices.

JAX
(to himself)
Yes...the NeuroSync algorithm is finally online...

Suddenly, the lab door bursts open and in walks LYRA (25), a beautiful and charismatic young woman with an air of quiet confidence.

LYRA
Jax! We have to talk.

JAX
(nervously)
What's going on? You know I'm right in the middle of something...

LYRA
(determined)
I've been watching you, Jax. And I know what you're trying to do.

CUT TO:

INT. PSYCHOSPHERE LABORATORIES - FLASHBACK

We see a series of rapid-fire flashbacks showing Lyra's troubled past: her parents dead in a brutal government crackdown; her own experiences with the oppressive Psychosphere regime...

CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

JAX
(uneasy)
What do you want from me?

LYRA
(calmly)
I want to help you. You're trying to free people from their minds, Jax. But it's not just about technology...it's about power.

JAX
(defensively)
That's not what I'm doing!

LYRA
(firmly)
Then why are you working on the NeuroSync algorithm? It can read and control every thought in a person's mind...

The camera zooms out as Jax looks taken aback. Lyra takes his hand, her touch sending shivers down his spine.

LYRA (CONT'D)
...and I know what you're capable of, Jax. You could stop the Psychosphere regime in its tracks.

CUT TO:

EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

As we watch from afar, strange occurrences start to happen: people suddenly becoming violent; buildings starting to crumble...

JAX
(whispering)
It's happening...the NeuroSync algorithm is online...

The city descends into chaos as Lyra and Jax look at each other in stunned silence.

CUT TO:

INT. CPD HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY

Detective Kate Matthews (35), a sharp and determined woman in her mid-30s, walks into the bustling homicide unit, flanked by two colleagues, Detective Mike Harris (40) and Detective Emily Chen (28).

KATE
(to Mike and Emily)
Alright, let's get to work. We've got a case that's been going cold for weeks.

MIKE
(skeptical)
A missing person's case? Kate, we're short-staffed as it is. Can't we prioritize something else?

KATE
(firmly)
No way, Mike. This one's different. The victim was a young professional with no history of trouble. Her family is frantic.

EMILY
(eager)
Can I see the file?

Kate hands Emily the folder, who begins to scan its contents as Kate and Mike head to the conference room for a briefing.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Kate and Mike review the case with their team: Detective Tom Bradley (45), a seasoned veteran; and Lieutenant Rachel Lee (50), a no-nonsense supervisor.

KATE
(summarizing)
Victim's name is Sarah Johnson, 25. Last seen leaving work on January 10th. Her car was found abandoned in an alleyway downtown. No signs of foul play or struggle.

MIKE
(skeptical)
No witnesses?

EMILY
(shaking her head)
None that we've been able to find. But I did find something interesting...

Kate leans forward, intrigued.

KATE
(whispering)
What is it?

EMILY
(hesitant)
Sarah's phone records show a string of cryptic texts with someone named "Echo". Whoever Echo was, they were really close to Sarah.

MIKE
(doubtful)
Maybe she just had a crush on this person?

KATE
(firmly)
No way. I've seen the texts. This is something more.

The team falls silent as they contemplate Emily's revelation.

CUT TO:

EXT. CPD HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY

Kate steps out into the hallway, phone in hand, to call her old friend and former FBI profiler, Dr. Elliot Thompson (40).

KATE
(into phone)
Elliot, it's Kate. I need your expertise on a case.

ELLIOT (V.O.)
(over the phone)
What've you got?

KATE
(confidently)
A possible abduction. And I think our perp might be hiding in plain sight.

ELLIT (V.O.)
(intrigued)
Go on...

Kate explains the details of Sarah's disappearance, including the cryptic texts with Echo.

CUT TO:

INT. CPD HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY

The team reconvenes to discuss Kate's findings and brainstorm potential leads.

MIKE
(skeptical)
We need concrete evidence before we start chasing shadows.

KATE
(firmly)
I agree. But I also know that sometimes the smallest details can be the key to cracking a case.

Emily nods in agreement, her eyes locked on Kate.

EMILY
(whispering)
You're thinking Echo is more than just a name.

Kate gives Emily a faint smile, hinting at something deeper.

KATE
(to the team)
Alright. Let's go back to the beginning and re-examine every detail. Sometimes, the devil is in the details.

The team nods in unison as the camera pans out, showing the intricate web of clues that will lead them on a thrilling investigation.

FADE IN:

INT. ABANDONED MANSION - DAY

We see a dusty, forgotten room filled with old trinkets and memories. We hear the sound of footsteps creaking up the stairs.

CUT TO:

LUCY (25), a young woman with a look of confusion on her face. She's standing in the middle of the room, looking around as if trying to remember something.

LUCY
(whispering to herself)
What was it? What was my name?

She begins to search through old photo albums and trunks, hoping to find some clue about her identity.

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK - LUCY AS A CHILD

We see Lucy as a young girl playing with her family in the same mansion. Her parents are laughing and smiling, but Lucy's expression is one of sadness.

LUCY (V.O.)
I used to be happy here. I had a life. But then... everything changed.

CUT TO:

PRESUMED LUCY'S MOTHER
(Lucy's mother from the flashback)
You're safe now, sweetie. You don't have to remember anything anymore.

LUCY (V.O.)
But why can't I remember? What happened to me?

CUT TO:

PRESENT DAY - LUCY

Lucy finds an old music box in the trunk and opens it. A beautiful melody fills the room, and she begins to hum along.

LUCY
(smiling)
I remember this... I think.

As she continues to search through the room, we see flashes of her past: her childhood memories, her relationships with people who seem familiar but whose faces are unclear.

CUT TO:

A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE

We see a figure watching Lucy from across the room. They're shrouded in shadows, making it impossible to discern their features.

LUCY
(nervously)
Who's there?

The figure doesn't respond, and instead disappears into thin air.

CUT TO:

PRESENT DAY - LUCY

Lucy is now sitting on a dusty old bed, surrounded by the trinkets and memories she uncovered. She looks at an old photograph of herself as a child and smiles.

LUCY
(to herself)
I think I'm starting to remember.

As she holds the photograph, we see flashes of her past again, but this time they're more vivid and clear. We see Lucy's face as it was years ago - happy, carefree, with a name that's slowly coming back to her.

LUCY (V.O.)
My name... my name is...

The camera zooms in on Lucy's face as she takes a deep breath.

LUCY
(smiling)
Emily.
