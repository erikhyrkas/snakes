Explain operating systems like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain what an operating system is in a super fun way!

Imagine you have a bunch of toys, and each toy has its own special job to do. You might have a toy car that makes "vroom" noises, a toy robot that can talk, and a toy computer that can play games.

But, sometimes it gets hard to know which toy to use when! Should I play with the car? Or should I talk to my robot friend?

That's where your operating system comes in!

Your operating system is like a special grown-up helper who knows how all of your toys work together. It helps you decide what toy to use next, and it makes sure they all get along.

Just like how your mom or dad helps you pick out the right game for playtime, an operating system helps your computer (or phone, or tablet) know which games or apps to open, and when!

Here are some super cool jobs that your operating system does:

1. **It keeps track of all your toys**: Your operating system knows how many toys you have, what each toy is for, and where they're stored.
2. **It helps them work together**: Just like how your friends can share toys in a sandbox, your operating system makes sure that different programs or games on your computer play nicely together!
3. **It makes decisions**: If you ask your computer to open the wrong game, your operating system will politely say, "Hey! I think this other one is what you meant!"

So, an operating system is like a super cool helper who keeps all of your toys working smoothly and playing nice with each other!

Do you get it now?

Explain geometry like I'm five years old.<start>GEOMETRY IS FUN!

So, you know how we can draw shapes on a piece of paper, right? Like circles, squares, and triangles?

Well, geometry is the study of those shapes! It's like being a master builder, but instead of building with blocks, you build with lines, angles, and curves.

Let me explain some cool things about geometry:

**Points**: A point is just a tiny dot on a piece of paper. It's like a single spot where two lines meet.

**Lines**: A line is like a long, straight path that connects two points. You can draw lines with your pencil or even make them with your finger!

**Angles**: An angle is when two lines meet at a point. If they're flat against each other, it's called a "straight" angle. But if one line turns into the other like an elbow, it's called a "curved" angle.

**Shapes**: Ahah! This is the best part! Geometry has lots of fun shapes, like:

* **Squares**: Four straight sides all the same length.
* **Circles**: A shape that goes on forever in a curvy path. (It looks like a big hug!)
* **Triangles**: Three sides with one angle at the top and two angles on the bottom.

**Patterns**: Geometry is also about finding patterns with shapes and lines. Like, can you make a pattern with red squares and blue triangles?

So, geometry is all about playing with shapes, making new ones, and solving puzzles to find out what makes them work together!

How was that? Do you feel like a geometry superstar now?

Explain algae like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about ALGAE!

Algae are special kinds of tiny plants that live in water. They're like super tiny little green friends that grow and swim around in the ocean, lakes, and even ponds!

Just like how you have hair on your head, algae have tiny strands or "hairs" called filaments that help them move through the water. It's like they're swimming with a built-in umbrella!

Algae are also very good at making food from sunlight. They use a special power called photosynthesis to turn sunlight into yummy energy for themselves and other living things.

You might have seen green scum on top of a pond or lake before? That's usually algae growing and multiplying! It's like they're having their own little green party in the water!

But don't worry, algae are actually super helpful friends. They help keep our planet healthy by making oxygen for us to breathe, just like trees do!

So, that's what algae are like – tiny, green, swimming plants that make food and friends with sunlight!
<end>

Explain cloud computing like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you going to love this!

So, you know how we use computers and laptops to play games, watch videos, and do homework? Well, those computers have a special kind of storage inside them called "hard drive" that helps us save our files, pictures, and stuff.

But what if I told you that there's a way to store all your files, pictures, and even whole computer programs in a big, magic place called "the cloud"? It's like a super-big library where you can keep all your digital things safe and sound!

Imagine a huge building with rows and rows of shelves filled with millions and millions of tiny boxes. Each box is like a special container that holds one of your files or pictures. But instead of being in the hard drive on your computer, those containers are stored in this big magic building called "the cloud"!

Here's how it works:

1. You do something on your computer, like save a picture.
2. That picture gets sent to the magic building (cloud) as a tiny container.
3. The cloud stores that container with all your other files and pictures from lots of other people!
4. Now, you can access that picture (or any other file) from anywhere! Even if your computer breaks or you lose it, your files are still safe in the cloud!

That's basically what "cloud computing" is – a way to store and access all your digital things from anywhere, using magic containers called "the cloud"!

Isn't that cool?
<end>

Explain social media like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain social media to you in a super fun way!

Imagine you have lots of friends at school, and you all want to talk to each other and share things with each other. That's kind of like what social media is.

But instead of talking face-to-face or sending letters in the mail, people use special computers called phones or tablets to talk to each other on the internet!

There are lots of different kinds of social media, but some popular ones include:

* Facebook: It's like a big scrapbook where you can post pictures and messages for all your friends to see!
* Instagram: It's like a super cool photo album where people share pictures and videos with their friends.
* Twitter: It's like sending a message in a bottle... but instead of throwing it in the ocean, you send it on the internet!

When you use social media, you can:

* Share your thoughts and feelings with friends
* Post pictures or videos of cool things you're doing
* See what your friends are up to
* Even make new friends who like the same things as you!

But remember, just like in real life, it's super important to be kind and respectful when using social media. Don't say anything mean or hurtful, okay?

Does that make sense?
<end>

Explain viruses like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about VIRUSES!

So, you know how sometimes we get sick and feel yucky? Like when you have a cold or the flu?

Well, that's usually because of tiny little things called viruses. They're kind of like tiny robots that can make us sick.

Imagine these viruses are like tiny monsters that sneak into our body. They multiply really fast, like how popcorn makes more popcorn in a microwave!

When they multiply too much, it's like a big battle inside our body. Our immune system (that's the superhero part of our body) tries to fight them off, but sometimes we need help from medicines or even just rest to feel better.

Here are some cool things about viruses:

* They're so tiny that you need special machines to see them!
* Some viruses can make us sick, but others don't hurt us at all (like the ones that help plants grow!).
* We have special helpers in our body called antibodies that can fight off bad viruses.

And the good news is... most of the time, we get better and feel happy again!

How's that? Do you have any questions about viruses now?
<end>

Explain snowflakes like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about SNOWFLAKES!

You know how sometimes it snows outside? And the snow is all fluffy and white? Well, those are called snowflakes!

Snowflakes are tiny little pieces of ice that fall from the sky when it's cold outside. They're like magic crystals that form in the air, and they're all different shapes and sizes!

Imagine you have a special machine that can make ice cubes really quickly. But instead of making just one big ice cube, this machine makes lots and lots of tiny little ice cubes that are all different from each other.

That's kind of like what happens when snowflakes form in the air! The cold air up high gets all mixed up with water vapor (that's just a fancy word for "water in the air"), and it starts to freeze into teeny-tiny pieces of ice. These pieces of ice get blown around by the wind, and they start to grow and change shape as they float down towards the ground.

That's why every snowflake is unique! Just like how you have your own special face, a snowflake has its own special shape. And just like how you can see lots of different faces in a crowd, there are millions and millions of snowflakes falling from the sky at the same time!

Isn't that COOL?
<end>

Explain elements like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about ELEMENTS!

So, you know how we can see things around us, like trees, cars, and even YOU? Well, everything in the world is made up of tiny, tiny building blocks called ELEMENTS.

Think of them like LEGO bricks! Just like how you can use different colored LEGOs to build all sorts of cool things, elements are like special kinds of LEGO bricks that make up everything around us.

There are 118 different elements, and each one has its own special name. Some examples include:

* Oxygen (you need it to breathe!)
* Carbon (it's in trees and even YOU!)
* Hydrogen (it's what makes up water!)

These elements come together in different ways to make all sorts of things, like:

* A pencil is made from graphite and wood
* A toy car is made from plastic, metal, and rubber
* You are made from lots and lots of tiny elements that work together to make YOU!

So, that's what elements are! They're the special building blocks that make up everything in the world. Isn't it cool?
<end>

Explain caves like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about CAVES!

A cave is a special kind of hole in the ground that's dark and quiet inside. It's like a secret room, hidden from the outside world.

You see, when it rains or snows outside, water can seep into the ground and make tiny holes over time. These holes get bigger and bigger, and eventually they form a big cave!

Imagine you're playing in a sandbox, and you dig a deep hole with your bucket. That's kind of like what happens to create a cave.

Inside a cave, it's really dark because there are no windows or lights. But that means it's also very quiet, because there's no wind or noise from outside. It's just peaceful and still inside the cave!

Some caves have special things in them, like sparkly rocks or pools of water. And sometimes, if you're lucky, you might even find ancient drawings or fossils on the walls! 

But remember, caves can be tricky to explore. You should always go with a grown-up who knows how to navigate through the cave safely.

Wouldn't it be cool to visit a cave someday and see all its secret wonders?
<end>

Explain sociology like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you ready for a fun explanation?

So, you know how there are lots of people in the world, right? Like, billions and billions of them! And they all live together in big groups called communities.

Well, sociologists (say "so-shi-ol-o-gists") are like super cool detectives who want to understand how these groups work. They try to figure out why people do things, and how they feel about each other.

Imagine you're playing with your friends at school. You all like to play together on the swings and slide. But sometimes, you might have disagreements or feel left out. A sociologist would be interested in learning more about why that happens, and how it makes everyone feel.

They ask questions like:

* Why do people like to hang out with certain friends more than others?
* Why do we follow rules at school? (like staying in our seat during lessons)
* How does it make us feel when someone is mean or unfair?

By studying these things, sociologists can help us understand how society works. They want to know how we can make the world a better place for everyone.

Here are some fun examples:

* Why do people have birthdays and celebrate special days?
* Why do we have different rules in different countries? (like wearing seatbelts or helmets)
* How do our families, schools, and communities help shape who we become?

Sociologists want to know all these things so they can help make the world a better place for everyone! They're like superheroes, but instead of capes, they wear thinking caps!

How was that? Did I explain sociology in a way that made sense to you?
<end>

Explain the internet like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain the internet to you in a super fun way!

So, you know how we have lots of books and pictures at home? And sometimes we go to the library or a store to get more?

Well, the internet is kind of like a HUGE library that's connected to every single house in the world! It's called the "World Wide Web" (say it with me: WORLD WIDE WEB!).

Imagine you're playing with blocks, and each block has a special name. On the internet, these blocks are called "websites". They can have pictures, words, or even games on them!

When you want to look at something on the internet, like a picture of a cat, you use a special tool called a "computer" (or a phone!). You type in the name of what you want to see (like "cat picture"), and then... MAGIC!

The computer talks to the "internet" (which is like a super-smart librarian), and it finds the website with the cat picture. The internet brings that website back to your computer, so you can look at it on your screen!

But here's the really cool thing about the internet: it lets YOU talk back to other people too! You can write messages (called "emails"), share pictures or videos (like with Instagram), and even play games with friends who are far, far away!

So, the internet is like a huge playground where you can learn, play, and talk to others from all around the world. And it's always getting bigger and more fun!

How was that explanation? Do you have any questions about the internet now?
<end>

Explain big data like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain BIG DATA to you in a super fun way!

Imagine you have a lemonade stand. You sell lemonade to people who walk by, and you want to know how well your stand is doing.

You can count the money you make each day, like this:

Monday: 10 dollars
Tuesday: 12 dollars
Wednesday: 15 dollars

But that's not all! You can also keep track of things like:

* How many people came to buy lemonade (like 50 on Monday and 75 on Tuesday)
* What flavors they liked best (classic, strawberry, or mango)
* Where the people came from (the school next door or a friend's house)

All this information is like tiny puzzle pieces. When you put them together, it's called BIG DATA!

Big data is like a super-powerful computer system that can collect and connect all these puzzle pieces for lots of different things, not just lemonade stands! It helps grown-ups make decisions, solve problems, and even predict what will happen in the future.

Just like how you use your counting money to know if your lemonade stand is successful, big data helps people make better choices, like:

* How many bikes should be made for a company?
* Where should a new store open?
* What kind of toys are most popular?

It's like having a magic supercomputer that can help us understand and improve things in our world!

How was that? Do you get it now?
<end>

Explain the cloud like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you ready for this?

So, you know how we can see big fluffy clouds in the sky on a sunny day? Like, the kind that make rainbows sometimes?

Well, the computer thingy called "the internet" is like a really, really big cloud that's invisible! It's not something we can see with our eyes, but it's still there.

When you save pictures or games or stories on your tablet or phone, they get stored in this special cloud. That means they're kept safe and sound somewhere far away, so you can access them whenever you want!

Imagine you have a big box where you keep all your favorite toys. The internet is like a super-big box that's shared with everyone, so we can all play together and use the same toys.

The "cloud" part means it's like something floating in the air (even though we can't see it), and it's always changing and getting bigger as more people add their own things to it. Make sense?
<end>

Explain leaves like I'm five years old.<start>LEAVES ARE SO COOL!

Okay, little buddy, so you know how trees are all around us? Well, they have something called leaves that grow on them.

Leaves are like the food makers for trees! They help the tree get the energy it needs to grow big and strong. Just like how you need to eat food to have energy to play, trees need leaves to make their own food!

Imagine a tiny factory inside each leaf, making yummy food for the tree. That's basically what's happening!

Leaves also help the tree breathe by taking in air and letting out water vapor. It's like when you take deep breaths through your nose and mouth.

And guess what? Leaves come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colors! Some are big and flat, some are pointy and small, and others are super pretty with intricate patterns!

So, leaves are basically superheroes for trees, helping them grow, breathe, and stay healthy. Pretty cool, huh?

Do you have any questions about leaves now?
<end>

Explain the Earth's Core like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about the Earth's Core!

So, you know how we live on a big ball called the Earth, right? And it's made up of all sorts of things like air, water, and dirt?

Well, deep inside the Earth, there are two special parts that help make our planet work properly. They're called the Core!

Imagine a big fire going on inside the Earth. That's kind of what the Core is like! But instead of flames, it's made up of super-hot liquid metal that goes round and round really fast.

There are two types of cores: a solid core and a liquid core.

The solid core is at the very center of the Earth, and it's really hard and heavy. It's like a big rock!

The liquid core surrounds the solid core, and it's made up of melted metal that can flow around. It's like a special kind of soup that's so hot it would melt any ordinary spoon!

This Core is what helps make our planet spin around in space, and it also helps create the Earth's magnetic field – which is like a big shield that protects us from bad stuff coming from space.

So, isn't the Earth's Core just cool?
<end>

Explain the oceans like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about the OCEANS!

The oceans are HUGE bodies of water that cover most of our planet, Earth! They're so big that if you put all the water together, it would make a giant ocean that's over 70% of the whole Earth! 

Imagine being on a super-long road trip, and the whole car is just filled with blue liquid. That's kind of like what the oceans are like!

There are five main oceans: the Pacific Ocean (that's the biggest one!), the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Southern Ocean (also called the Antarctic Ocean).

The oceans have lots of cool things in them:

* **Fish!** Lots and lots of different kinds of fish live in the ocean. Some are tiny, some are big and colorful.
* **Whales!** These huge animals sing songs to each other and swim around with their friends.
* **Sharks!** (But don't worry, most sharks aren't scary. They just like to swim around and eat small fish.)
* **Corals!** These are special plants that make pretty, swirly patterns on the ocean floor.
* **Turtles!** Some turtles even live in the ocean!

The oceans also help us by:

* Giving us water to drink
* Helping plants grow with their yummy nutrients
* Regulating the weather (which means keeping it not too hot or too cold)
* Supporting lots of different kinds of animals and plants

Wow, that's a lot about the oceans! Do you have any questions?
<end>

Explain the heart like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about the HEART!

Your heart is a special muscle that lives inside your chest, just below where you feel your voice box when you talk. It's a tiny little organ that pumps YUMMY RED BLOOD into all the parts of your body.

Just like how you need water to drink so your skin can stay healthy and strong, your blood carries food and oxygen to make sure everything in your body is happy and working well!

Your heart goes "Beep! Beep!" (like a little drum) about 100 times per minute when you're sitting quietly. And that's just the beginning! When you run around or do fun activities, it beats even faster, like a super-fast drummer!

The heart has four special friends who help take care of things:

* The Arteries: These are the roads that carry blood away from your heart to all the other parts of your body.
* The Veins: These are the roads that bring blood back to your heart after it's delivered its yummy stuff!
* The Heart Chambers: These are like special rooms inside your heart where the blood goes in and out.

Your heart is so important because it helps you do everything! Without it, you wouldn't be able to run around with friends, eat yummy food, or even sleep!

Isn't that COOL?
<end>

Explain the food chain like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about FOOD CHAINS!

A food chain is like a big circle of friends that eat each other, but don't worry, it's not weird or gross! It's just how animals get their food.

Here's an example:

**Lions** are at the top of our food chain. They love to eat... **Zebras**!

But where do zebras get their food from? Zebras like to eat **Grass**, which is yummy and green!

Now, grass doesn't move around or run away, so who eats it? It's actually tiny little bugs called **Insects** that munch on the grass.

So, our food chain looks like this:

1. Grass (insects eat it)
2. Insects (zebras eat them)
3. Zebras (lions eat them)

See how they all connect? That's a simple food chain!

But remember, every living thing needs food to survive, and that's why there are many different levels in the food chain.

How was that explanation? Do you have any questions about food chains now?
<end>

Explain encryption like I'm five years old.<start>Imagine you have a super secret box where you keep your favorite toy. You want to make sure that only YOU can open the box and play with the toy, not anyone else.

To do this, we use something called "encryption". Encryption is like putting a special lock on the box.

First, we take a message (like a note to your friend) and turn it into a secret code. This code looks like gibberish to everyone except YOU, because you're the only one who knows how to decode it.

The secret code is like a puzzle that can't be solved by anyone else. Even if someone tries to look inside the box (or read the note), they won't understand what's written there.

To open the box and play with your toy, or to see the message in plain language, you need a special key. This key is like a magic word that unlocks the secret code and lets you read it.

Encryption is how we make sure that our messages (like emails, texts, or online passwords) are safe from prying eyes. It's like putting a lock on our thoughts!

But here's the best part: if someone tries to take your toy (or access your message), they'll see only the secret code. They won't be able to play with your toy or understand the message until they get the right key... which is just YOU!
<end>

Explain habitats like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about HABITATS!

So, you know how we live in houses with our families? Well, animals and plants live in their own special places too, called HABITATS.

A habitat is like a big house for an animal or plant. It's where they live, eat, sleep, and have fun! Just like how your bedroom is where you sleep and play.

Different animals need different kinds of habitats. Some like to live in the WATER, like fish and frogs. They swim around and find food to eat. 

Some animals like to live in TREES, like birds and squirrels. They climb up high and make nests for themselves.

And some animals like to live on LAND, like rabbits and bears. They hop around or walk on four legs and find yummy food to munch on.

Even plants have habitats! Some like to grow in the SUNNY fields, while others like to grow in SHADED areas.

So, just like how you need a cozy home, animals and plants need their own special places to live and thrive. That's what HABITATS are all about!

Does that make sense?
<end>

Explain dreams like I'm five years old.<start>Dreams are like magic movies that happen in your brain when you're sleeping!

You know how sometimes you imagine things, like flying on a dragon or having a giant water slide? Well, during sleep, your brain is like a super cool movie maker, and it creates these special pictures and stories just for you.

These pictures and stories are called dreams. They can be happy, sad, silly, or even scary! But don't worry, they're just pretend, like when you play make-believe with your friends.

Sometimes, your brain might show you things that seem real, but really aren't. Like maybe you'll dream that you're at the park and it's sunny outside, but when you wake up, it might be raining! That's okay, though - your brain is just trying to have some fun while you sleep.

And the best part? You get to be the star of your own special movie! Your brain lets you imagine anything you want, so you can dream about being a superhero, or eating all your favorite foods, or even meeting a talking animal (like a dragon!).

So, dreams are like magic movies that only happen in your brain when you're sleeping. And who knows what kind of amazing adventures they'll take you on?
<end>

Explain astronomy like I'm five years old.<start>Astronomy is SO COOL!

You know how we live on a big planet called Earth, right? Well, there are other planets just like our Earth, floating around in space! And that's not all - there are also stars, which are like really bright lights in the sky.

Imagine you're outside at night, and you see the moon up high. That's actually a big rock that goes around the Earth! It takes about 27 days to go all the way around our planet.

But what's even more amazing is that there are other moons too! Some of them are just as big as the one we have on our Earth. And guess what? There are also stars with their own planets, and some of those planets might be just like our own!

Now, let's talk about the stars themselves. They're really hot, glowing balls of gas in space. They make their own light, so when we see them from far away, it looks like they're shining. Some stars are close to us, while others are super far away.

One really cool thing about stars is that some of them can even have their own little families - just like our own family on Earth! But instead of having a mom and dad, these "families" are called solar systems, and they're made up of many planets all orbiting around one big star.

And here's the most amazing part: there are so many stars in space that we can't even count them all! It's like looking at a huge, twinkly ocean of light stretching out into infinity.

Wow, right? Astronomy is like having a front-row seat to an incredible cosmic show! Who knows what secrets we'll discover next?

Would you like to learn more about the amazing things in space?
<end>

Explain human migration like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about something cool called human migration!

You know how there are lots of different kinds of animals that live in different places, like birds that fly to warm places in the winter? Well, people can move to new places too! This is called human migration.

Imagine your family has a big house, but it gets really hot and sunny outside. You might want to go somewhere cooler with green trees and grass where you can play outside without getting too hot. That's kind of like what happens when people migrate!

Some reasons why people move to new places are:

1. **They're hungry!** Just like animals need food, humans do too! If there's a place with lots of yummy food and water, they might want to go there.
2. **It's too hot or cold!** Some places are really hot in the summer or really cold in the winter. People might move to places where it's just right for them.
3. **They're looking for adventure!** Some people like to explore new places and meet new friends. It's like going on a big adventure!
4. **They need a better life.** Sometimes, people have to leave their homes because they don't have enough money or food. They might move to a place where they can find work and make a better life for themselves.

Just like animals migrate to find safe places to live, humans do the same thing! We move to new places for all sorts of reasons. And you know what? It's okay! Humans are very good at adapting to new places and making new friends.

That's human migration in a nutshell (or a peanut shell, haha!). Do you have any questions about it?
<end>

Explain lungs like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain lungs to you!

You know how we breathe in and out all the time? Like when we take a big breath and our tummy goes up, and then we let it go and our tummy goes back down?

Well, inside our body, there are two special helpers called LUNGS! They're like two big balloons that help us get the air we need to breathe.

When we inhale (that's when we take a deep breath in), the lungs fill up with air like water filling up a pool. And then, when we exhale (that's when we let it go), they empty out and we get rid of the old air.

The lungs are so important because they help us breathe in good oxygen and breathe out bad stuff called carbon dioxide. It's kind of like how our toys need fresh air to work properly!

And guess what? Our lungs are connected to a special tube called a TRACHEA (say "tray-key-ah") that goes all the way down into our tummy! That's why when we cough, it feels like something is coming up from inside us.

So, that's what lungs do! They're like two superheroes that help us breathe and stay healthy!

How was that? Do you have any questions about lungs now?
<end>

Explain the endocrine system like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain something super cool to you!

You know how sometimes you might feel happy, or hungry, or sleepy? That's because of a special helper inside your body called the endocrine system.

The endocrine system is like a team of tiny messengers that help your body do all sorts of important things. They're like little superheroes!

Here are some of the main superheroes in the endocrine system:

1. **Hormones**: These are special helpers that swim through your blood and tell different parts of your body what to do. Think of them like special messages that say "Hey, I'm hungry!" or "I need a break!"
2. **The Pituitary Gland**: This is the boss of all the superheroes! It helps decide who should be doing what job in your body.
3. **The Thyroid Gland**: This superhero helps you grow and feel strong. It's like a special growth serum that makes you taller, stronger, and smarter!
4. **The Adrenal Glands**: These are two superheroes that help you deal with stress and scary things. They're like a pair of brave warriors who jump into action to protect you!

When all these superheroes work together, they help your body do amazing things, like:

* Grow strong and healthy
* Feel happy or sad (depending on what's happening in your life!)
* Sleep well at night
* Run around and play during the day

So that's the endocrine system! It's a team of tiny messengers who help keep you happy, healthy, and ready for all sorts of fun adventures!

How was that? Do you feel like you understand the endocrine system now?
<end>
