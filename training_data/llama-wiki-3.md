Write a wiki article about Earthquake.<start>**Earthquake**

An earthquake is a strong shaking of the ground that happens when there is movement in the Earth's crust. It can cause buildings to fall down and hurt people.

**What Causes an Earthquake?**

The Earth's crust is made up of big pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are always moving, slowly, over time. When they move, they sometimes get stuck. This causes a buildup of energy. Eventually, the energy releases suddenly, causing the ground to shake.

* **Tectonic earthquake**: This is the most common type. It happens when the tectonic plates move.
* **Volcanic earthquake**: This happens near a volcano that is erupting or about to erupt.

**Effects of an Earthquake**

An earthquake can cause:

* Damage to buildings, roads, and bridges
* Landslides and mudslides
* Tsunamis (big waves) in the ocean
* Power outages
* Injuries and deaths

**How to Stay Safe During an Earthquake**

If you are near a place where an earthquake is happening:

1. **Stay calm**: This will help you think clearly.
2. **Get away from buildings**: If you are outside, move away from buildings. If you are inside, stand in a doorway or under a sturdy table.
3. **Drop to the ground**: Crouch down with your feet shoulder-width apart and your head tucked into your chest.
4. **Hold onto something**: Hold onto a stable object like a table leg or a chair leg.

**After an Earthquake**

If you are in an area that has had an earthquake:

* **Check for injuries**: Help people who are hurt.
* **Turn off gas and electricity**: If the power is out, turn off any gas lines to prevent fires.

**Size and Shape**

Titan is very large compared to other moons in our solar system. It measures approximately 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) across, which is about half the size of Earth's diameter. Titan has a thick atmosphere that covers most of its surface, giving it a hazy appearance from space.

**Surface Features**

The surface of Titan is very cold and dark due to its distance from the Sun. The temperature on Titan can drop as low as -179°C (-285°F). Scientists have detected lakes of liquid methane on Titan's surface, which are filled with methane gas. These lakes are one of the most interesting features of Titan.

**Orbit**

Titan orbits around Saturn at a distance of about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) from the planet's center. The moon takes approximately 16 Earth days to complete one orbit around Saturn.

**Interesting Facts**

* Titan is larger than the planet Mercury.
* The atmosphere on Titan contains nitrogen and methane gases, similar to those found in the early Earth's atmosphere.
* Scientists believe that life might have existed on Titan in its distant past due to the presence of liquid water on the moon's surface.
