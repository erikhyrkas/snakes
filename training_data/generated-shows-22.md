We meet our protagonist, JACK (35), a former Navy SEAL turned marine researcher. He's standing in front of a large map of the coast, surrounded by his colleagues.

JACK
( to his team )
Alright, guys. We've got a big one coming in. A storm system is heading straight for us, and I'm talking Category 5.

DR. KIM (30s), a marine biologist, looks up from her notes.

DR. KIM
We're not just worried about the wind and rain, Jack. This storm could push the ocean levels up to 10 feet higher than usual. We need to warn the townspeople.

JACK
(nodding)
Agreed. But we also need to prepare for what's coming. I'm talking evacuations, emergency protocols... everything.

CUT TO:

EXT. COASTAL TOWN - LATER

The storm is approaching fast. People are scrambling to board up their homes and businesses. Jack and his team are working to set up a makeshift command center.

JACK
(into radio)
We're in position, dispatch. Ready to receive instructions.

DISPATCH (V.O.)
Roger that, Stormsurge Team. We've got you on radar. The National Guard is on its way to assist with evacuations.

Suddenly, the storm hits. Wind and rain batter the town, causing chaos and destruction. Jack's team springs into action, helping to rescue people trapped in their homes.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEACH - LATER

The storm surge has hit the coast, flooding the beach and sweeping away cars and buildings. Jack and his team are fighting to stay afloat as they try to reach a group of stranded civilians.

JACK
(shouting over the wind)
We need to move, now!

One of the civilians, a young woman named SARAH (20s), is caught in the current. Jack grabs onto her arm and starts to pull her towards him.

SARAH
(terrified)
I've got you! Hold on!

As they fight against the waves, Jack's team manages to grab them and bring them back to safety.

CUT TO:

The storm has passed, but the damage is severe. Jack's team is assessing the situation, trying to figure out how many people are missing or injured.

JACK
(to his team)
Alright... let's get to work on a rescue plan. We need to find anyone who's still stranded and get them to safety.

DR. KIM
(looking at a map)
I think I've found something, Jack. There's a small island just offshore that might have taken a hit from the storm surge. If we're lucky, there might be survivors there too.

JACK
(nodding)
Alright... let's gear up and head out. We'll need to move fast if we're going to find anyone who's still alive.

The camera pans over a desolate, rural landscape before zooming in on a small, weathered motel sign that reads "Welcome to Raven's Peak". We see JESS (28), a determined and worn-out young woman, step out of her dusty old truck and gaze around at the rundown buildings.

INT. RAVEN'S PEAK MOTEL - DAY

Jess knocks on the office door, which creaks open to reveal an equally weathered motel owner, MR. KWAN (60s). He's got a kind face, but his eyes are tired from years of running the failing business.

MR. KWAN
(frankly)
You're not from around here, huh?

JESS
(forced smile)
Just passing through.

Kwan looks Jess up and down before nodding.

MR. KWAN

Jess takes the key, her eyes lingering on Kwan's worn face before turning away.

INT. RAVEN'S PEAK MOTEL - ROOM 3 - DAY

INT. RAVEN'S PEAK MOTEL - NIGHT

Kwan knocks on the door of Room 3. He hands Jess an envelope with a single note inside:

"Meet me at the old water tower at midnight. - J."

Jess's eyes lock onto Kwan's, her face a mix of fear and anticipation.

What if it's not just a dream? What if...

Suddenly, one of the advisors approaches her.

ADVISOR ZAREK
Your Majesty, we've received news from the farthest reaches of our kingdom. Strange occurrences have been reported. Crops are withering, and people are disappearing in the night.

Arin, I've been tracking these disappearances for weeks. It feels like something is watching us from the shadows.

ARIN
(hesitant)
We can't rule out the possibility of internal strife or natural causes. Let's gather more information before drawing conclusions.

As they speak, a faint humming noise begins to emanate from the forest. The camera zooms in on Loran, who looks concerned.

CUT TO:

INT. ARIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY

Arin sits at his desk, pouring over ancient texts and scrolls. He's accompanied by ERIOL (20), Aria's younger cousin and a skilled scholar.

ERIOL
(excited)
Arin, I think I've found something! An ancient prophecy speaks of a great imbalance in the world, where darkness threatens to consume the light.

ARIN
(skeptical)
A myth? We can't put credence in old stories...

ERIOL
(determined)
This isn't just any story. The prophecy speaks of a chosen one, destined to restore balance and bring peace to the kingdom.

Arin looks intrigued.

KAELOkays to himself, "I have to get out of here."

Suddenly, Kael stumbles upon a hidden chamber deep within the temple. The room is filled with ancient artifacts and mysterious devices. His eyes land on a glowing crystal nestled in a pedestal.

No...it can't be...

He approaches the crystal cautiously, sensing an otherworldly energy emanating from it.

CUT TO:

FLASHBACKS

We see Kael as a young boy (10), being trained by a wise old man named Lyrien (60s) in the art of prophecy and magic. We see glimpses of his training, his struggles to master the craft, and his eventual betrayal at the hands of his own mentor.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. TEMPLE - DAY

As Kael reaches out to touch the crystal, a blinding light envelops him. He stumbles backward, shielding his eyes.

Suddenly, visions flood his mind: apocalyptic landscapes, wars, famine...and an ancient prophecy that speaks of a chosen one, destined to bring balance to a world on the brink of destruction.

Kael's eyes snap open as he realizes the truth about himself and his destiny. He knows that he is the last oracle, a being tasked with guiding humanity through its darkest hour.

Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. It's KATSUO'S NEIGHBOR, Mrs. Tanaka, who's in her 60s and has a gentle smile.

MRS. TANAKA
Sorry to bother you, Katsu-san! I just wanted to remind you that it's laundry day today!

KATSUO

Dr. Valentine stumbles back into the laboratory, shaken but alive. She sees Chrono standing amidst the wreckage and gasps in amazement.

EMILY
Hey, I brought lunch!

YUI

Oh, um, thanks! I wasn't really thinking about eating anything.

EMILY
(laying down a bento box and sitting next to Yui on the couch)
Come on, you're wasting away in here. We need to get some food into that body of yours!

As they eat together, we see flashes of Yui's life outside her apartment: she works as a part-time barista at a small cafe; she has a quiet but intense relationship with a colleague, TAKASHI; and she spends most Sundays exploring the city with Emily.

The conversation turns to Yui's upcoming birthday. Emily asks her what kind of party she wants to have, but Yui hesitates, unsure of how to answer.

YUI
(hesitant)
I don't know... I feel like turning 25 is a big deal or something...

EMILY

It doesn't matter! We'll do whatever you want. You can stay home and sleep all day if that's what you want!

However, as they delve deeper into each other's lives, secrets start to surface. Jessica reveals she's been engaged but called it off due to her own doubts, while Max confesses he has a daughter back in the city, whom he's barely seen since his breakup.

Dude, what's going on? You've been holed up in here for three days straight.

MAX
( sheepishly ) Oh, just getting some stuff done. You know, the usual.

The hooded figure steps forward, revealing ARIN (30s), a grizzled veteran of many battles.

ARIN

You know the risks, Eira. The ones who seek revenge often find themselves consumed by their own darkness. Are you prepared for that?

Alright, lads! We've got a new shipment coming in. And I can guarantee that no one will be bothering us while we do our business.

The townspeople exchange nervous glances as Grim's group arrives at the town hall. Eira steps forward, her sword drawn.

EIRA
(her voice dripping with menace)
You're not welcome here, Grim. Leave now and never return.

GRIM
(sneering)
Or what? You'll try to take us on, alone? We've got better things to do than play hero.

Arin approaches Eira, his expression grave.

ARIN

This is it, Eira. The moment you've been waiting for. Are you ready?

Please, you have to help me! My family's farm is being taken over by the ruthless rancher, VICTOR VALENTINE. He's going to ruin us!

The patrons turn to look at McCall, who sets his drink down and stands up.

JACK

What makes you think I can help you?

LUCY

My pa used to be a close friend of yours, Jack. You were like family to us. He always spoke highly of your...code.

McCall's eyes narrow slightly at the mention of his code.

EMILY
(to her partner, TOM)
Okay, Tom, what do we know?

TOM
(nervously fidgeting)
Lady Harrington's personal maid, Mrs. Jenkins, found the body this morning in the east wing. Looks like a straight-up murder.

We are in one of the many watchtowers along Hadrian's Wall, where a group of Roman soldiers are stationed to monitor the surrounding area for signs of Celtic raiders or other threats.

CAPTAIN MARCUS (40s), a seasoned soldier and leader among his comrades, is pacing back and forth across the tower, deep in thought. His second-in-command, SARGENTIUS (30s), is attempting to engage him in conversation.

SARGENTIUS
Captain, we need to discuss the rationing of supplies for the upcoming month. I've made a list...

MARCUS
(interrupting)
Later, Sergentius. I'm trying to figure out something.

Suddenly, the lookout above shouts down from the upper level of the tower.

LOOKOUT
Sir! Sir, I think I see something!

The soldiers quickly gather around Marcus as he rushes up to the window to take a look. In the distance, they spot a lone figure on horseback, watching them from across the wall.

MARCUS
(whispering)
That's no Celtic warrior. Look at his garb...he's dressed like one of our own.

SARGENTIUS
(confused)
What do you mean?

MARCUS

If he's not a raider, then who is he? And why is he watching us?

The mysterious figure watches them go before emerging from his hiding spot and continuing on his way.

CUT TO:

Back at the watchtower, Marcus is summoned by the officer in charge, TIBERIUS (50s), who's pacing across the courtyard, looking worried.

TIBERIUS
Marcus! I've just received a message from Rome. There are rumors of a potential rebellion brewing among the Roman legions stationed along the wall.

MARCUS
(surprised)
A rebellion? But that can't be...

TIBERIUS
(serious)
It's true, Marcus. And we need to find out what's going on before it's too late.

As Tiberius speaks, a nervous-looking soldier approaches him from the shadows, looking over his shoulder as if he fears being watched.

Sir...I may have seen something that could be connected to this rebellion...

JASON (23), the apparent leader of the group, steps forward to address his team.

JASON:
Alright, guys. We've got a situation developing downtown. Reports are coming in about an energy anomaly emanating from the city's power plant. Our scouts indicate it might be connected to the mysterious attacks on our equipment warehouses over the past week.

SARAH (22), the team's tech expert, looks up from her comms device.

SARAH:
Jason, I'm reading something weird here. These energy spikes are not just random - they're following a specific pattern, like they're trying to create some kind of resonance wave.

JASON:
That sounds exactly like what we've been tracking. This is our chance to finally get to the bottom of things.

The Eclipse Enforcers nod in unison and begin to disperse, readying themselves for action.

As the team infiltrates the power plant's restricted areas, they're met with a shocking sight: massive energy-producing machines are generating waves that resonate at an eerie frequency.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows - VICTOR (30s), a former physicist turned rogue scientist.

VICTOR:
Welcome, Eclipse Enforcers. You've arrived just in time to witness my masterpiece.

The team is stunned as Victor reveals his plan: harnessing the planet's very energy itself and using it to fuel an unstoppable super-weapon.

JASON:
You can't be serious. This is catastrophic!

VICTOR:
Oh, I'm perfectly serious. And with this power at our fingertips, nothing will ever stop us again.

As Victor activates the machines, a brilliant light engulfs the area. The Eclipse Enforcers leap into action to stop him and mitigate the damage.

JASON:
You can't let your obsession consume you. We're here to protect this city and everyone in it!

VICTOR:
This city... will soon be nothing but dust and ash.

With a fierce determination, Jason takes down Victor's energy-draining device, rendering the rogue scientist mortal once more.

As the team successfully shuts down the machines and defeats Victor's goons, they share a triumphant moment together - a testament to their strength as individuals and as a team.

EMIYLA: (returning to the shop, tears in her eyes) Thank you, Jason. I feel lighter.

Alright, here's the situation. Our water reserves are down to 20% capacity, and our agricultural sector is struggling to produce enough food to sustain us.

We're doing everything we can, Captain. But without access to external resources...we're running out of options.

MAJOR HARRIS

Time's ticking, Doctor. We need a plan to get back on our feet before it's too late.

CAPTAIN KIM
(squinting at the data streaming across her console)
I agree with Tom. We can't keep relying on internal resources alone. I'm proposing we send out an expedition team to scavenge for supplies and information outside the Refuge.

Captain, that's a risk we can't afford! What if they encounter...whatever happened to cause this disaster in the first place?

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see JEN (28), a successful event planner, sipping on a coffee and scrolling through her phone. Her best friend, SARAH (27), enters the shop and plops down in the chair across from Jen.

SARAH
Hey, girl! How's life treating you?

JEN
(sarcastically)
Oh, you know. Just the usual. Working, adulting... you know how it is.

SARAH
(laughing)
Exactly! I mean, who needs love and relationships when you have a 401k and Netflix, am I right?

JEN
(smiling)
Totally. Although, my mom still insists that's not the point of life.

CUT TO:

INT. JEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jen is trying to cook dinner while simultaneously browsing through an online dating app on her phone. She swipes left on a guy who looks like he's 12 years old and starts to get frustrated.

SARAH (V.O.)
You know, Jen, you're not getting any younger. Maybe it's time to put yourself out there?

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Jen is now at a speed-dating event with a bunch of other single people in the city. She looks nervous as she sits down across from a guy named MIKE (30).

MIKE
So, what do you like to do for fun?

JEN
(nervously)
Uh... I'm really into trying new craft beers and eating at trendy restaurants.

MIKE
(skeptically)
That sounds... interesting. Do you have any hobbies?

JEN
(hesitantly)
I... um... I collect antique teapots?

MIKE
(stunned)
Oh... wow.

Cut to:

INT. JEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Sarah is over at Jen's apartment, trying to give her advice on how to navigate the world of dating.

SARAH
Seriously, just be yourself. Unless you can be someone else who's more interesting and successful. Then be that person.

Jen nods in agreement as they both burst out laughing.

CUT TO:

INT. JEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Jen is now on a date with Mike at a trendy restaurant. They're trying to make small talk, but it's clear they have nothing in common.

MIKE
So... uh... what do you like to do for exercise?

JEN
(eagerly)
I'm really into kickboxing!

MIKE
(surprised)
Whoa... that's so cool! I'm more of a... yoga guy myself.

Jen nods politely as they both try to pretend like they're actually having fun.

We meet our protagonist, ASTRID (28), a rugged and resourceful bayou guide, rummaging through dusty shelves for supplies. She's been hired by a wealthy client to find his missing daughter, EMILY (25).

"They're watching."

Suddenly, Astrid is confronted by a group of menacing figures, armed to the teeth.

ASTRID
(firmly)
Who are you?

The leader, a menacing figure named RAVEN (30), sneers at her.

RAVEN
We've been waiting for you. You're the one they call Nightshade's daughter.
