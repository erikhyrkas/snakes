Write a wiki article about Pluto.<start>**Pluto**

Pluto is a small planet in our solar system. It was discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh.

**Location and Movement**

Pluto is located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond the orbits of Neptune and Uranus. It moves around the sun once every 248 Earth years. Pluto's orbit takes it as close as 29.7 astronomical units (AU) from the sun and as far as 49.3 AU.

**Physical Characteristics**

Pluto is a small, icy world with a diameter of about 2,374 kilometers (1,475 miles). It has a highly eccentric orbit, which means its distance from the sun varies greatly throughout the year. Pluto's surface is composed mostly of nitrogen ice and rock.

**Moons**

Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. The largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978 and is about half the size of Pluto itself.

**Status as a Planet**

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet. This decision was made because Pluto's orbit overlaps with that of Neptune, and it does not meet the IAU's definition of a planet as an object that "clears its neighborhood" of other objects.

**Interesting Facts**

* Pluto is no longer considered one of the nine planets in our solar system.
* It takes Pluto 6.4 Earth days to rotate once on its axis.
* The surface temperature of Pluto can drop to as low as -233°C (-391°F) at night, making it one of the coldest places in the solar system.

Write a wiki article about Climate change.<start>**Climate Change**

**What is Climate Change?**

Climate change refers to the long-term warming of the Earth's surface due to an increase in average global temperatures. This occurs when there is too much greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere.

**Causes of Climate Change**

The main causes of climate change are:

* **Burning fossil fuels**: The use of coal, oil, and gas for energy releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air.
* **Deforestation**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When forests are cut down or burned, less carbon is absorbed.
* **Industrial activities**: Factories and other industrial processes also release greenhouse gases.

**Effects of Climate Change**

Climate change has many negative effects on the environment and human societies:

* **Rising sea levels**: As temperatures rise, polar ice caps melt, causing sea levels to increase.
* **Extreme weather events**: Warmer air can hold more moisture, leading to more intense hurricanes, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall events.
* **Changes in ecosystems**: Rising temperatures disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems, affecting plant and animal species.

**Consequences for Humans**

Climate change also affects human health, economies, and societies:

* **Food shortages**: Changes in weather patterns can lead to crop failures and reduced food availability.
* **Water scarcity**: Increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures reduces available water resources.
