**Act I:**

The camera pans over the serene coastline, the sound of waves gently lapping at the shore. We see a young woman, JESSICA (25), standing on the edge of the water, her long blonde hair blowing in the sea breeze. She's staring out at something in the distance.

Jessica speaks to herself, a mixture of sadness and longing in her voice: "You were always drawn to the ocean, Mom. I get it now."

CUT TO:

A flashback sequence, showing Jessica as a child with her mother on a beach vacation. Her mom (35), smiling and laughing, points out at the sea. "The tides can be strong, Jess. But sometimes, you just have to let go."

Jessica's eyes well up with tears, and she turns away from the camera.

**Act II:**

Cut back to the present, where we meet our second main character, MIKE (28), a ruggedly handsome Coast Guard officer on patrol in his boat. He spots Jessica standing on the beach and immediately becomes intrigued.

Mike pulls into shore and jumps out of the boat, walking towards Jessica with a friendly smile. "Hey there! You lost or something?"

Jessica looks up, startled, but quickly composes herself. "No, I'm fine. Just... admiring the view."

Mike chuckles and takes a seat next to her on a nearby rock. They start chatting about their shared love of the ocean. As they talk, we see flashbacks of Jessica's difficult past: her parents' divorce, her mother's passing.

Jessica reveals that she moved from the city to escape her memories, but the ocean seems to be calling her back.

Mike listens attentively, his eyes filled with understanding and kindness. The chemistry between them is palpable.

**Act III:**

As they continue talking, Mike invites Jessica on a ride-along with him in the Coast Guard boat. She agrees, and as they speed across the water, we see their rapport growing stronger.

Back at the beach, Jessica's friends - LUCY (22) and SARAH (25) - try to pry information out of her about the mysterious guy who seemed interested in her. Jessica brushes them off, claiming she was just talking to a friend.

Cut back to Mike, who's showing Jessica around his boat, introducing her to his colleagues, and making her feel welcome. As they prepare to return to shore, Mike offers Jessica a life jacket. She hesitates for a moment before taking it from him.

**Act IV:**

As the sun sets over the ocean, Mike and Jessica find themselves standing on the edge of the water, hand in hand. They share a soft kiss as the waves crash around them.

In a final flashback, we see Jessica's mother smiling at her son, who had just moved away to serve in the Coast Guard. "You'll always have each other," she says.

The camera pans back to Mike and Jessica, now facing each other with tears in their eyes.

We see a dense, mist-shrouded forest stretching as far as the eye can see. The camera pans across the landscape, showing the twisted trunks and gnarled branches of ancient trees.

CUT TO:

INT. BLACKWATER TAVERN - DAY

A grizzled old WYVERN, named GRIMBLE, sits at a wooden bar, nursing a mug of ale. He's joined by a young half-elf, EIRA (25), with piercing green eyes and shoulder-length dark hair.

EIRA
(leaning in)
Grimble, I'm looking for information on the Lost City of Eldrador. Have you heard anything?

GRIMBLE
(skeptical)
You're not the first to ask about that place, kid. But be warned: it's cursed.

Eira looks undeterred.

EIRA
(curious)
What do you mean by "cursed"?

GRIMBLE
(wistful)
Legend says Eldrador was a city of magic and wonder. The ancient dragons themselves were said to have walked among its people. But the city fell, consumed by darkness and chaos. Some say it's still there, waiting for someone brave enough to face what lies within.

Eira nods thoughtfully, her eyes gleaming with determination.

CUT TO:

EXT. DRAGON'S MIST - DAY

We follow Eira as she ventures into the mist-shrouded forest, accompanied by GRIMBLE and a young WIZARD named ZAZ (22), who's carrying a sturdy staff. They trek through the dense foliage for hours, until they stumble upon an ancient entrance to Eldrador.

ZAZ
(whispering)
By the gods...this is it.

GRIMBLE
(skeptical)
You sure you want to do this, kid? The stories about this place...

EIRA
(determined)
We have to try. Who knows what kind of secrets we might uncover?

As they step through the entrance, the camera follows them into the heart of Eldrador.

CUT TO:

INT. ELDADRADOR - DAY

The trio finds themselves in a grand courtyard, surrounded by crumbling spires and ancient statues. The air is heavy with the scent of old magic.

ZAZ
(worried)
What kind of curse are we talking about, Grimble? This place feels...unstable.

GRIMBLE
(gravely serious)
This city was built on a site where dragons once ruled. Their power still lingers here. You can feel it in the air.

Eira looks around, her eyes drinking in the history and magic surrounding them.

CUT TO:

EXT. ELDADRADOR - DAY

As they explore further, strange occurrences begin to happen: ancient structures start crumbling, eerie whispers echo through the halls, and flickering torches seem to take on a life of their own. The trio realizes that they're not alone in Eldrador...

And then, out of nowhere, a towering DRAGON emerges from the shadows.

Rachel, Jason's colleague and friend, briefs him on the situation.

RACHEL
So, this woman, Sophia, claims her email and social media accounts are being hacked from multiple locations around the world. She thinks it might be a stalker or an ex-boyfriend who wants revenge.

JASON
(skeptical)

RACHEL
I think someone gave it to her... maybe that new PI, Mark? He's been asking questions about your work in the Dark Net community.

CUT TO:

INT. MARK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We meet MARK (40s), a charming but untrustworthy private investigator. He seems genuinely interested in helping Sophia, but his motives are unclear.

CUT TO:

INT. CYBERSECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT

Jason and Rachel delve deeper into the case, tracing the hacking attempts to an anonymous server on the Dark Net. As they dig in, they realize that Sophia's online presence is just a small part of a much larger scheme.

JASON

We need to get inside this server. I can try to crack the encryption...

RACHEL

Jason, are you sure? We don't know what we're up against here...

CUT TO:

INT. CYBERSECURITY OFFICE - LATER

Jason successfully infiltrates the Dark Net server, but not without alerting the perpetrator, a ghost in the machine who seems to be watching his every move.

We find ourselves in a bustling tavern, filled with fishermen and sailors. We spot our protagonist, KAEDEN (25), a young fisherman with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes. He's telling a tale to a group of admirers.

KAEDEN
...and then the sea serpent rose up out of the depths! Its scales shone like polished silver in the sunlight.

The patrons ooh and ah, while Kaeden grins, clearly enjoying the attention.

CUT TO:

EXT. COASTAL TOWN - DAY

We see a group of townsfolk gathered at the water's edge, staring out at the sea. They're speaking in hushed tones, their faces etched with worry.

KAEDEN
(stepping forward)
What's going on? What's happening?

One of the townsfolk steps forward.

TOWNSPERSON 1
It's the stormsurge! The ancient prophecy says it'll return this year. We've been warned to prepare...

Kaeden looks uneasy, his eyes scanning the horizon.

KAEDEN
(whispering)
The prophecy? You mean...the one about the return of EREBUS?

TOWNSPERSON 1
(nodding)
Aye, that's the one. The Lord of the Storms himself is said to ride the riptide this year...

Kaeden looks away, his expression troubled.

CUT TO:

INT. BLACKWATER TAVERN - DAY

As Kaeden returns to the tavern, we see a mysterious figure sitting in the corner, shrouded in shadows. The figure catches Kaeden's eye and beckons him over.

KAEDEN
(hesitant)
Who are you?

Mysterious Figure
(revealing a chiseled face with piercing green eyes)
I'm someone who knows what's at stake. EREBUS is coming, Kaeden Blackwood. And when he does...the seas will rise up and engulf us all.

Kaeden looks shocked, but the mysterious figure hands him a small, intricately carved wooden box.

Mysterious Figure
This contains a map that'll lead you to the truth. Trust no one, Kaeden. Not even yourself.

With that, the figure disappears into the shadows, leaving Kaeden bewildered and confused.

CUT TO:

As night begins to fall, we see Kaeden standing at the water's edge, staring out at the turbulent sea. The camera pans up to reveal a massive storm brewing on the horizon.

We see our protagonist, JESSICA (28), sitting at a small table by the window, staring at her phone with a mix of frustration and sadness on her face.

JESSICA
(to herself)
Why can't I just move on?

Suddenly, she hears a faint voice behind her.

VOICE
Excuse me...

Jessica turns around to see a handsome stranger, MIKE (30), standing next to her table. He's holding two cups of coffee and looks apologetic.

MIKE
I'm so sorry, but I think I might have accidentally spilled coffee on your book.

Jessica's eyes widen as she takes in Mike's charming smile and piercing blue eyes.

JESSICA
(laughing)
Oh no, that's okay! It happens to the best of us.

Mike sets down one of the cups and starts sipping from it. Jessica can't help but notice how smooth he looks.

MIKE
(to himself)
Wow, you're even more beautiful than I thought...

Jessica feels a flutter in her chest as she realizes Mike is staring at her.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Mike and Jessica strike up a conversation, exchanging stories about their lives, passions, and dreams. As they talk, the camera pans out to reveal the bustling coffee shop around them, but it's clear that they're lost in their own little world.

Jessica shares her struggles with moving on from a past heartbreak, while Mike reveals his aspirations as a struggling artist. Their conversation flows effortlessly, like they've known each other for years.

As they finish their drinks and prepare to leave, Mike scribbles his phone number on a napkin.

MIKE
(smiling)
I'd love to grab coffee with you again sometime. Maybe not here, though...

Jessica's face lights up as she takes the napkin from him.

As they part ways, the camera lingers on Mike's smile and Jessica's radiant glow.

We see JAX (30s), a former scientist at the research station, rummaging through the remains of his lab. His eyes are sunken, his face gaunt from months of survival on his own.

Jax whispers to himself as he searches for something specific. Suddenly, he stops and looks up, as if hearing something.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED RESEARCH STATION - DAY

We see a figure emerging from the distance, walking towards the research station with an otherworldly gait. The camera follows this figure as it draws closer, revealing...

LUCAS (30s), a charismatic and enigmatic individual.

LUCAS
(smiling)
Jax. It's been a long time.

JAX

Lucas? What are you doing here?

LUCAS
(sheathing his pack)
I could ask the same of you, Jax. You're supposed to be dead.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED RESEARCH STATION - LABORATORY - DAY

As Lucas and Jax reacquaint themselves, we see flashbacks of their past work together at the research station. They were working on a top-secret project called "ECHO," designed to communicate with parallel universes.

JAX
(whispering)
We succeeded in making contact, but at what cost? The energies were too great... and we lost control...

LUCAS
(nodding)
I know. I've been experiencing echoes of our past selves. Fragments of timelines merging.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED RESEARCH STATION - DAY

As the two men converse, the landscape around them begins to distort and ripple. The camera zooms out to reveal a multitude of parallel universes converging on this point in space-time.

Yes, I understand. We'll get him prepped ASAP.

Suddenly, a young woman, EMILY (22), bursts into the waiting room, frantic and crying. Sarah immediately puts her phone down to attend to Emily.

EMILY
Oh God, Dr. Jenkins! My brother... he was in an accident... they said he's in critical condition...

Emily explains the situation as Sarah listens attentively.

SARAH
(assessing the situation)
Alright, let's get him prepped for surgery. I want to talk to his family...

As Sarah begins to work on the patient, she notices something unusual about the young man's injuries.

SARAH
(to Jessica)
Wait a minute... this doesn't look like your average hit-and-run victim.

JESSICA

What do you mean?

SARAH
(serious)
His injuries are too severe for an ordinary accident. I think we might be dealing with something more sinister here...

LORD GOWAN (40s), a stern-looking nobleman, stands at the head of the table, addressing the gathering.

LORD GOWAN
...and so, I call upon ye to gather 'round, good people o' Castle Rock. We've received news from the Highlands that the Jacobite forces are on the move once more.

CASTLE ROCK'S CHAPLAIN (30s), a pious-looking man with a thick Scottish brogue, speaks up.

CHAPLAIN
But milord, surely ye dinnae believe...?

LORD GOWAN
Believe what? That those rebels would seek to overthrow the rightful King George II? I think it's more than likely. We must take precautions.

Suddenly, a young woman, MEGGIE (20s), with striking green eyes and dark hair, bursts into the Great Hall, breathless and disheveled.

MEGGIE
Forgive me, milord! But I've just arrived from the village below. There's been... strange happenings in the night. Tools gone missin', food stored away... and some folks speak o' a mysterious figure lurkin' about the castle walls at dusk.

LORD GOWAN

Meggie, ye're a weaver, not a spy. What business do ye have with these affairs?

Meggie sits at her loom, weaving a fine linen cloth as she works on a new design. Her eyes stray to a parchment hidden amongst her threads.

MEGGIE (V.O.)
I've been keepin' these journals for years now... chronicling the whispers and tales o' this castle's past. And I think I may have stumbled upon somethin'.

She lifts her quill, dips it in ink, and begins to write:

"'...and on a night such as this, when darkness shrouds the land...the spirits of old stir once more...'"

As Meggie writes, the camera zooms out, revealing an ancient manuscript on a nearby shelf. The pages are filled with intricate drawings of Celtic knots and symbols.

MEGGIE (V.O.)
I've always been told these stories were mere fables... but what if they're true? What if our castle holds more than just stone and steel?

The camera lingers on Meggie's writing, as the room grows darker around her.

The camera pans over a vast, arid expanse of sand and rock, the sun beating down relentlessly. We see a figure emerging from the distance, walking towards us with a determined stride.

CUT TO:

JAXON (30s), a ruggedly handsome and athletic young man with a scar above his left eyebrow and a determined look on his face. He's dressed in tattered but practical clothing, carrying a large backpack and a rifle slung over his shoulder.

JAXON
(to himself)
Finally made it out of the settlement.

CUT TO:

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

We see a makeshift camp in the distance, surrounded by a makeshift wall of sandbags and barbed wire. Jaxon's eyes flicker towards the settlement as he approaches.

CUT TO:

INT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

Jaxon enters the settlement, where we meet his friends and allies: MIA (20s), a whip-smart and resourceful young woman with short black hair; GUNNER (30s), a grizzled old soldier with a thick beard and a talent for explosives; and KAI (20s), a lanky and affable tech-whiz kid.

MIA
Jaxon! We were starting to think you'd never make it back.

GUNNER
(nodding)
Yeah, we've got a situation here. The Order's been sniffing around.

KAI
(fiddling with his phone)
And I'm trying to hack into their comms system... but it's like they're on a whole different network.

JAXON
(nodding, serious)
Alright, let's gear up. We've got work to do.

CUT TO:

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

The team briefs each other on the plan: take out the Order's communications array and disrupt their operations in the area. Jaxon leads the charge, with Mia and Gunner providing cover from a nearby ridge.

CUT TO:

EXT. COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY - DAY

Jaxon and his team make their way through the desert, dodging sandstorms and hostile patrols along the way. They finally reach the communications array, a large satellite dish surrounded by layers of security fencing.

KAI
(whispering into Jaxon's earpiece)
I've got the encryption cracked... but we're running out of time. The Order will have backup in minutes.

JAXON
(grimly)
Alright, let's do this.

Gunner and Mia provide cover as Jaxon sneaks inside the perimeter fence. He makes his way to the communications array, where he encounters a high-ranking officer: RAVEN (30s), a cold and calculating woman with a scarred face and a talent for ruthlessness.

RAVEN
(sneering)
You're just in time to witness the birth of our new era, Jaxon. The Order will soon control this entire continent.

JAXON
(determined)
Not if we have anything to say about it.

The two engage in hand-to-hand combat as Mia and Gunner lay down suppressive fire outside.

CUT TO:

EXT. COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY - DAY

As the firefight rages on, Jaxon manages to disable the communications array. Raven is left wounded but alive, her cold gaze fixed on Jaxon with a promise of revenge.

JAXON
(to Mia and Gunner)
Get Kai out of here. We've got one more target to hit.

CUT TO:

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

As the team regroups, we see a glimpse of the larger world beyond their small settlement: a sprawling city in the distance, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and humming with activity.

MIA
(serious)
You know what this means, Jaxon. We're not just fighting for our home anymore. We're fighting for our future.

JAXON
(grimly)
Then let's get to it.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

We see a beautiful, yet foreboding forest, with tall trees swaying in the wind. The camera pans down to reveal a figure, JACK (35), dressed in worn jeans and a flannel shirt, walking through the woods, carrying a large backpack.

CUT TO:

INT. WOODS - DAY

Jack stops suddenly, looking around nervously. He pulls out a map from his backpack and studies it intently. Suddenly, he hears a faint rustling in the bushes nearby. Jack's head snaps up, eyes scanning the area, as he slowly draws a pocket knife from his belt.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A figure emerges from the underbrush. It's SARAH (30), dressed in a worn t-shirt and ripped jeans, carrying a small bag of supplies. She looks just as nervous as Jack.

JACK
(whispering)
What are you doing out here?

SARAH
(also whispering)
Just trying to get away from it all for a bit.

Jack eyes her warily, but then seems to relax slightly.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

Jack and Sarah enter an old cabin deep in the woods, locking the door behind them. They look at each other, unsure of what to say next.

SARAH
(nervously)
I'm sorry about just showing up like that.

JACK
(surprised)
You're not supposed to be here.

Sarah pulls out a small notebook and flips through its pages. Her eyes land on an entry: "August 15th, 3 days since the incident".

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

As they sit in the cabin, Jack begins to tell Sarah about what happened three days ago... A devastating wildfire that swept through these woods, destroying everything in its path.

JACK
(voice cracking)
...my brother was killed in it.

Sarah's expression turns somber as she processes this information. The two sit in silence for a moment, the weight of Jack's words sinking in.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

As they venture back into the woods, Sarah asks Jack about his plan to deal with the aftermath of the wildfire. Jack reveals that he's been trying to clear the area of any debris and hazards, but has made little progress so far.

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S TRUCK - DAY

Jack and Sarah drive through the charred remains of the forest, dodging fallen trees and debris along the way. They stop at a makeshift campsite where Jack is storing his supplies.

SARAH
(looking around)
This was your family's land?

JACK
(nodding)
Yeah...we grew up here.

Sarah nods sympathetically as they walk through the campsite, taking in the destruction and devastation that surrounds them.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

As night begins to fall, Jack and Sarah sit by a makeshift fire pit, watching the flames dance in front of them. The tension between them has dissipated somewhat, replaced by a sense of shared understanding.

JACK
(whispering)
I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this...

Sarah reaches out and gently places her hand on Jack's arm.

SARAH
(gently)
You'll get through it...we will.

As the fire crackles and spits, the camera pans up to reveal the dark silhouette of the forest looming above them. The sound of distant sirens pierces the air, growing louder by the second...

The school's football team is practicing for their big game against their arch-rivals, the Lincoln High Lions. The coach, JIM (40s), is yelling instructions at his players as they run drills.

JIM
Alright, guys! Let's move it! We can't let those Lions get the best of us!

The camera pans to the star quarterback, TYLER (18), who's trying out a new throw. His best friend and teammate, JASON (18), is watching from the sidelines, offering words of encouragement.

JASON
You got this, Ty! Just relax and let it fly!

(supportively)
We'll win together! We've got this!

CUT TO:

EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

The big day has finally arrived, and the townspeople are gathered in the parking lot to watch the game on a giant screen.

The camera pans across the crowd, showing various familiar faces: Marsha's chili cheese fries are being devoured by the tailgaters; Lucy is cheering along with her friends; and Jim is giving his final pep talk to the team before they take the field.

As the game begins, the energy in the air becomes palpable. The camera cuts between the action on the field and the excitement of the townspeople watching from the sidelines.

The score is neck-and-neck as the clock winds down. The tension builds as the home team makes a last-minute drive towards the end zone.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

We see a bustling coffee shop, with customers typing away on their laptops or chatting with friends. We focus in on one table, where we meet our main character, JESS (28), a creative and quirky young woman with bright pink hair.

Jess sits at the table with her best friend, SARAH (29), who is sipping on a latte. Sarah has just arrived from a chaotic morning of dealing with traffic.

SARAH
(exhaling)
I'm so glad I made it here without too much stress.

JESS
(smiling)
Welcome to the land of coffee and sanity.

Sarah chuckles as they catch up on their lives, discussing everything from work to hobbies. Meanwhile, we see a series of brief vignettes showcasing other customers in the shop:

* A harried mom trying to get her toddler to drink his hot chocolate.
* An artist sketching the scenery outside the window.
* A young couple nervously exchanging phone numbers.

As Jess and Sarah chat, we learn more about their friendship. They bonded over their shared love of coffee, literature, and making the most out of life's little moments.

INT. JESS'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Jess arrives home, carrying a large bag of groceries. She heads straight to her kitchen, where she begins preparing lunch for herself and Sarah.

As she chops vegetables, we see flashbacks of Jess's day so far: helping an elderly neighbor carry their groceries, exchanging pleasantries with the shop owner, and running into a friend on the street who shared a laugh with her.

Jess puts together a delicious-looking salad and heads to the fridge for the finishing touches. She looks at her phone, where she sees a text from Sarah asking her to pick up some fresh fruit on the way back.

Lucy and Emily are attempting to cook dinner together, but things quickly spiral out of control.

**THE END**<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Crime streaming series. The title of the series is `Fractured Lives`.<start>**Episode 1: "Shattered Memories"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a small, idyllic town in the Pacific Northwest. We see people going about their daily business, smiling and waving at one another.

We're introduced to our protagonist, Detective Emily Windsor (35), a no-nonsense, sharp-minded investigator with a troubled past. She's working on a new case with her partner, Detective Ryan Thompson (40).

The two detectives are called to the local hospital where they meet Jane Doe (25), a young woman who was found unconscious in a park with severe head trauma.

Jane has no memory of how she ended up there or what happened to her. As Emily and Ryan begin questioning Jane, it becomes clear that she's suffering from retrograde amnesia - she can't recall any details about her life before the incident.

**Act II:**

As the investigation unfolds, Emily discovers that Jane was living on the streets for several months prior to the attack. The only clue is a small piece of paper with a phone number scribbled on it.

Emily's instincts tell her that something doesn't add up. She becomes obsessed with finding out who Jane really is and what happened to her before the attack.

Ryan, however, is more skeptical, thinking that this might be just another case of a young woman getting mixed up in some bad company.

As Emily digs deeper, she meets Sarah Johnson (30), a quirky artist who claims to know Jane. Sarah's alibi for the night of the attack checks out, but Emily remains unsure about her motives.

Meanwhile, we see flashbacks of Jane's life before the attack, where she's working as an exotic dancer and getting into some shady business dealings with a mysterious figure.

**Act III:**

As Emily closes in on Jane's true identity, she discovers that Sarah is actually Jane's twin sister. The two women had been estranged for years after a falling out over their mother's funeral.

Sarah reveals to Emily that Jane was working as an informant for the police department when she got too close to something big. She was supposed to meet with her handler on the night of the attack, but never showed up.

Emily is convinced that Sarah is telling the truth and that the mysterious figure from Jane's past is involved in some sort of corruption within the police department.

As the episode ends, Emily confronts Ryan about his skepticism earlier. She tells him that she trusts her instincts and will continue to investigate until she uncovers the truth.

The camera pans out as we see a glimpse of the true extent of the corruption: a seemingly innocuous officer is seen on the phone with an unknown party, discussing something in hushed tones.

**Closing shot:**

Emily's voiceover echoes as she reflects on her own troubled past and how this case has triggered some dark memories:

"I've always said that our experiences shape us. But sometimes they shatter us. And it's only when we confront the fragments of our own lives that we can begin to heal."

The screen fades to black, setting up the rest of the series for a thrilling ride into the depths of human corruption and redemption.<end>

JEN:
Alright guys, it's a new year. Time to set some goals.

MIKE:
(excitedly)
Yeah! I'm gonna lose 50 pounds this year!

SARAH:
(skeptical)
Good luck with that, Mike. You've been saying that since the Clinton administration.

TOM:

I'm gonna learn how to play the guitar and become a rockstar!

EMILY:

And I'm gonna finally learn how to cook something other than ramen noodles.

JEN:

The friends all high-five each other, except for Sarah who just rolls her eyes.

The friends are trying to stick to their new year's resolutions. Mike is on a treadmill, sweating profusely and looking like he's about to collapse. Tom is attempting to play the guitar but is clearly not getting it. Emily is in the kitchen, attempting to make some sort of complicated dish but ends up setting off the fire alarm.

SARAH:
(sitting on the couch, eating Cheetos)
I'm just going to stick with my resolution: do nothing and eat as much junk food as possible.

JEN:
(laughing)
That's not a resolution, Sarah! That's just your life plan!

CUT TO:

INT. BAR - NIGHT

The friends are out at the bar, celebrating their failed attempts at sticking to their resolutions.

MIKE:
(deflated)
I guess I'm just going to stick with my old motto: "If it fits in 10 minutes, cook it for 20!"

TOM:
(disappointed)
And I still can't play the guitar. Maybe I'll just become a professional clown instead!

EMILY:
(giggling)
At least you're trying! That's what matters, right?

SARAH:
(smirking)
Yeah, and who needs to cook anyway? We've got Cheetos.

JEN:

JESS
(to herself)
Okay, Jess. You've been planning this for months. Just get in there and do it.

Jess steps out of the car and approaches the entrance to the radio station. She tries the door, but it's locked. She looks around, takes a deep breath, and pulls out a crowbar from her backpack. With a few swift motions, she pries open the door.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED RADIO STATION - NIGHT

Jess steps inside, calling out into the darkness.

JESS
Hello? Is anyone here?

As she moves deeper into the station, we see rows of dusty old broadcast equipment and cobweb-shrouded office supplies. She approaches a console with a microphone in front of it.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED RADIO STATION - CONSOLE - NIGHT

Jess takes a seat at the console, adjusts the mic to her mouth, and speaks into it.

JESS
(in a clear, strong voice)
Good evening, KMOR-FM listeners. I'm Jess... (pauses) And welcome back to our broadcast.

**Act II:**

As Jess begins to speak, we see flashes of images on a monitor behind her - news clips from the past few years, all featuring catastrophic events and disasters. The anchor's expression becomes increasingly grave as she continues to speak.

JESS
(voice rising in urgency)
We're talking about earthquakes that brought down cities. Fires that consumed everything in their path. And pandemics that... (pauses) ...changed everything.

As Jess speaks, the images on the monitor grow more and more distorted - like a broken TV channel. We see scenes of chaos: buildings crumbling, people running, and sirens blaring.

JESS
(voice trembling)
I'm telling you this because... (pauses again)

Suddenly, the power flickers out, plunging the room into darkness.

**Act III:**

Jess fumbles in the dark for a flashlight on the console. As she turns it on, we see that she's surrounded by more than just dust and old equipment - there are signs of looting, and strange symbols scrawled on the walls.

JESS
(whispering to herself)
What happened here?

As Jess tries to make sense of her surroundings, we hear footsteps outside the room. They grow louder and closer, until a figure steps into the light.

**Climax:**

The figure is revealed to be a young boy, no more than 10 years old. He looks up at Jess with a mix of fear and pleading in his eyes.

BOY
Please...

Jess hesitates for a moment before responding.

JESS
(softly)
What's your name?

BOY
(proudly)
I'm Max.

Max takes a step closer to Jess, who instinctively holds out her hands as if for protection.

JESS
(backing away)
Who are you? What happened here?

Max glances around nervously before responding in a hushed tone.

MAX
(whispering)
The... the broadcast. It's not safe. They'll come for us soon...

Jess looks confused, and then suddenly alarmed.

**Resolution:**

As Jess tries to process what Max is telling her, the lights flicker back on. But instead of returning to normal, we see a different image on the monitor - a graphic with the words "Aftershock Wave" emblazoned across it.

JESS
(alarmed)
Oh no...

JEN
...and that's why I'm telling you, we need to find a new roommate. ASAP.

MIKE

Oh, because this one was working out so well. I mean, who needs electricity and hot water, anyway?

Jen rolls her eyes.

JEN
You know exactly what I'm talking about, Mike. The smell of last week's Chinese food, the mystery stains on the carpet... it's a miracle we haven't been evicted yet.

What's that look for?

MIKE

Just contemplating my life choices.

Yeah... but maybe it's not as simple as just finding someone new...

I don't know... maybe just flip a coin? Heads, he's in. Tails...

Mike looks at her incredulously.

MIKE
Really? That's your solution?

Everyone get down!

The team scatters, but Darkstar's enhanced strength allows him to disarm them in short order.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

As the last of the security team is taken care of, Darkstar approaches the container and examines it more closely. He uses his alien artifact-enhanced senses to scan for any hidden dangers or clues about what this energy could be used for.

DARKSTAR (V.O)
(whispering to himself)
What are they planning?

Suddenly, he hears a faint whisper in his earpiece, courtesy of his AI assistant, CERES.

CERES (V.O)
Darkstar, I'm picking up encrypted comms traffic from the leader's device. It looks like they're coordinating with someone... or something.

DARKSTAR
(squinting at the container)
Who are you dealing with?

CERES
(urgently)
Unidentified entity. Unknown parameters...

Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerges from the darkness, watching Darkstar from across the room.

UNSEEN FIGURE
(to herself)
Not tonight. Not yet.

The camera zooms in on her face, but it's too dark to make out any features.

EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

The camera pans over a vast, sun-drenched expanse of wilderness. We see a figure, Kael (30s), walking towards us from the distance. He's dressed in practical travel gear and carries a pack on his back.

KAEL: (to himself) Three days, that's all I have left. Then I'll be back to civilization.

As he walks, we notice strange markings etched into the trees around him. They seem to pulse with a soft blue glow.

CUT TO:

INT. KAELE'S ENCAMPMENT - DAY

Kael sets up his camp and begins to prepare a meal. He rummages through his pack, pulling out various herbs and powders.

KAEL: (whispering) Alright, let's see what the map says...

He unfurls a worn, hand-drawn map of the surrounding area. The markings from the trees seem to be reflected on the map itself.

CUT TO:

EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

Kael sets off once more, following the path indicated by the map. As he walks, the landscape shifts around him. We see glimpses of a lush forest, followed by a dry desert, and finally, a snow-capped mountain range.

KAEL: (whispering) This can't be right...

The camera lingers on Kael's face as he becomes increasingly perplexed.

CUT TO:

EXT. MYSTIC CIRCLE - DAY

Kael enters a clearing surrounded by towering ancient trees. In the center of the circle stands an enormous, glowing stone.

KAEL: (whispering) A Keystone...

The camera zooms in on Kael's face as he reaches out to touch the stone.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the trees - Lyra (20s), with striking features and long silver hair. Her eyes seem to hold an otherworldly intensity.

LYRA:
Your path is not your own,
Kael of the wandering heart.
The threads that bind you are not yours to command...

CUT TO:

EXT. MYSTIC CIRCLE - DAY

Kael's eyes widen as he tries to comprehend Lyra's words. The Keystone begins to glow brighter, and the air around them seems to vibrate with magic.

KAEL:
What do you mean? What threads?

LYRA:
The web of fate that binds us all,
A tapestry of choices, woven by the hand...

Kael's face contorts in confusion as Lyra speaks. The camera lingers on his expression.

CUT TO:

EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

As Kael walks away from the mystic circle, we see a glimpse of a figure watching him from the shadows - Arin (30s), with piercing green eyes and an enigmatic smile.

EXT. KALEEKOS PLANET - DAY

The camera pans over a breathtakingly beautiful alien world, with towering crystal spires and iridescent clouds. We see a group of space travelers emerging from their ship, dressed in sleek black armor.

CUT TO:

INT. SHIP - REACTOR ROOM - DAY

We see our main character, Kael (played by Chris Hemsworth), a skilled pilot and leader of the group, frantically trying to fix a malfunctioning reactor core. His closest friend and second-in-command, Lyra (played by Zendaya), enters the room.

LYRA
Kael, we have a problem.

KAEL
(alarmed)
What is it?

LYRA
(shaking her head)
The Starfall event is imminent. The energy readings are off the charts. We need to get out of here, now.

CUT TO:

EXT. KALEEKOS PLANET - DAY

As Lyra speaks, a massive shockwave starts building in the distance. The ground begins to shake and the sky fills with an otherworldly energy signature.

KAEL
(into comms device)
Aerthys, this is Kael. We have Starfall on our hands. Prepare for evac - NOW!

CUT TO:

EXT. SHIP - DAY

As the crew rushes to board their ship, we see a group of alien creatures emerging from the crystal spires. They are the Kaleekians, and they seem to be made entirely out of shifting colors.

AERTHYS (V.O.)
Kael, we have multiple hostiles bearing down on us. Recommend immediate-

Suddenly, Lyra intervenes with an idea.

LYRA
(urgently)
Wait! Kael, remember what I said about the ancient prophecy?

KAEL
(distracted)
What are you talking about, Lyra? We need to get out of here!

LYRA
(grabbing his arm)
The Starfall event is not just a natural disaster. It's connected to our ancestors' technology... and the very fabric of space-time itself.

CUT TO:

EXT. SHIP - DAY

As Kael hesitates, Lyra grabs a console and starts frantically typing away. The camera zooms in on her hands as she rapidly codes an encryption sequence...

KAEL
(concerned)
Lyra, what are you doing?!

LYRA
(smiling mischievously)
I'm encrypting the ship's database with ancient Kaleekian protocols. This way, we can navigate the Starfall event and avoid getting caught in its destructive path.

CUT TO:

EXT. KALEEKOS PLANET - DAY

The camera follows Lyra as she leads the crew through a swirling vortex of colors, their ship somehow able to withstand the intense energies emanating from the planet's core. We see flashes of ancient technology as they pass through the event...

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see JIM (30s), a lovable but slightly awkward guy, sitting at a small table with his friend MIKE (30s).

MIKE
(reading from his phone)
Okay, so I'm telling you, the secret to making it big in online content is to be as loud and obnoxious as possible.

JIM
(skeptical)
Uh-huh. That's why every single YouTuber has a million subscribers now.

MIKE
(defensively)
Hey, my guy just hit 10,000 followers! He's going to make us all rich!

Suddenly, the barista, LUCY (20s), approaches their table with an awkwardly placed tray of drinks.

LUCY
(nervously)
Uh, hi guys. So, I made a little mistake on your order...

JIM
(excitedly)
Oh no, what did you do?!

LUCY
(hesitantly)
I put whipped cream on the latte instead of the cappuccino... and then I also accidentally added an extra shot of espresso to your friend's drink.

MIKE
(stunned)
What?! That's like adding rocket fuel to my morning!

JIM
(dramatically)
It's a latte disaster!

As Mike frantically tries to down the super-caffeinated drink, Jim starts doing a comedic routine about the "latte-gate" incident.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Mike is now bouncing off the walls, having finished his drink. Jim is still standing at their table, trying to keep the scene going for comedic effect.

JIM
(mimicking Lucy)
"I'm so sorry! I'll make you a new drink... or I'll just give up and join a circus instead!"

The barista, now embarrassed, tries to intervene.

LUCY
(nervously)
Uh, guys, can we maybe talk about this outside?

As they exit the coffee shop, Jim continues his shtick, making fun of Mike's increasingly erratic behavior due to the caffeine high.

CUT TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The group is now walking down the street as Jim keeps going on and on.

MIKE
(still buzzing)
Guys, I think I just saw a squirrel that was actually wearing pants... or was it just a regular squirrel doing some weird dance?

LUCY
(exasperated)
Okay, okay, let's go get you some water...

As the group continues to bumble around, we see more and more bizarre things happening in the background – like a street performer dressed as a chicken getting into an argument with a nearby pedestrian.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

The chaos has spilled over into the park, where Jim is now doing an impromptu performance for a group of unsuspecting picnickers.

JIM
(yelling)
We're going to make online content so ridiculous that it'll be like a box of chocolates – you never know what kind of crazy thing will happen next!

As the episode wraps up with Jim and Mike's antics, Lucy is seen shaking her head in the background, chuckling despite herself.
