CUT TO:

AUGUSTE "THE ARCHON" (30s), a young and charismatic superhero with short, spiky hair and piercing blue eyes. He wears a sleek black and silver costume adorned with intricate circuitry patterns.

ARCHON
(to himself)
Another day, another dollar... or in my case, another day, another villain to stop.

CUT TO:

INT. ARCHON'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Auguste's eyes scan the rows of high-tech computer screens and monitoring systems as his trusted ally, KAI (20s), a genius hacker with short, choppy hair, frantically works on her laptop.

KAI
Archon! I've got something here!

ARCHON
(serious)
What is it?

KAI
(alarmed)
A massive energy signature has appeared in the city's central square. It's unlike anything I've seen before!

CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY

The camera shows a colossal, crystalline structure that seems to defy gravity and stretch towards the sky. A figure stands atop this monolith: ELYRIA (20s), a former scientist turned mad with ambition.

ELYRIA
(smiling maniacally)
Welcome, Archon! I've been expecting you!

ARCHON
(wary)
Elyria, what's going on? What is that thing?

ELYRIA
(proudly)
Behold, SkyHaven! A portal to a realm beyond our world. And with it... the power to reshape this city in my image.

CUT TO:

INT. ARCHON'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Archon and Kai work together, analyzing data from various sources as they try to understand Elyria's plan.

KAI
(concerned)
We can't let her succeed, Archon! If she uses SkyHaven to alter the city...

ARCHON
(determined)
Not on my watch. Let's gear up!

CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY

The battle between Archon and Elyria's minions is intense as they clash in a frenzy of light and sound effects. The two main characters face off.

ELYRIA
(cackling)
You think you can stop me, Archon? I have the power of SkyHaven!

ARCHON
(fierce determination)
I've stopped worse. You're not going to rewrite this city's blueprint without facing me first.

CUT TO:

INT. SKYHAVEN - DAY

Elyria attempts to harness the portal's energy for her twisted purposes, but Archon intervenes, determined to stop her. The two engage in a heated hand-to-hand combat as Kai works behind the scenes to disable SkyHaven's energy grid.

ELYRIA
(enraged)
You fool! You'll never save this city!

ARCHON
(resolute)
I won't let you harm anyone else. Elyria, it's over.

Elyria is defeated, and Archon stands victorious as Kai successfully sabotages the portal. The energy signature dissipates, and the city begins to return to normal.

CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY

As the dust settles, the camera pans out to reveal the aftermath of the battle: damaged buildings and debris scattered across the square. Archon stands tall, victorious but worn.

ARCHON
(to Kai)
Thanks for watching my back.

KAI

Always got your six, Archon.

The camera lingers on Auguste's determined expression as he surveys the city he protects.

Who are you?

ALEX

My name is Alexei. And you are...?

JACK
(cautious)
What makes you think I'm the right guy for this job?

ARLO
(smiling)
Let's just say we have... resources that suggest you're the ideal candidate for our little organization.

As Arlo speaks, the cameras on the wall begin to zoom in and out, creating an unsettling atmosphere.

We see ALEX whispering something into Jack's ear as they stand outside a large metal door.

ALEX

Listen, Jack. There are things that happen here at the Shadow Agency... things that you wouldn't believe.

Alex glances nervously around the room before leaning in close to whisper:

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Jack and Sarah infiltrate Victor Vex's hideout, dodging gunfire and hand-to-hand combat.

Got it.

CUT TO:

Sarah expertly hacks into Victor's system, while Jack takes out his henchmen one by one.

McCloud. I've heard a lot about you. Thought we could discuss a business proposition.

No, it's more than that. It feels like... a connection to something. Someone.

About an hour ago...I went to bed early, and...

**INTRO**

(Opening shot of a charming, small town on a sunny Sunday morning)

**CUT TO**

We see LUCY, a bright-eyed and curious young woman in her early twenties, walking down the main street with a gentle smile. She's carrying a wicker basket filled with bread and pastries from the local bakery.

LUCY: (to herself) Today is a perfect day for a stroll.

As she walks, we see the other townspeople going about their Sunday routines: a group of children playing tag in a park, an elderly woman tending to her garden, and a young couple holding hands and admiring the town's historic architecture.

**CUT TO**

Lucy approaches a quaint little shop called "Whimsy & Wonder" – the store where she works. Inside, we see JEN, Lucy's best friend and coworker, arranging an assortment of peculiar trinkets and gifts on a shelf.

JEN: (excitedly) Oh my gosh, have you seen these new shipment of vintage postcards? I'm totally obsessed with them!

LUCY: (laughing) Yeah, they're amazing. But what's more amazing is that we have a customer waiting for us in the back room.

Jen gives Lucy a mischievous grin as they head to the back to greet their customer.

**CUT TO**

The two women enter the back room, where we see MIKE, a quiet and reserved man who looks like he's been staring at a map of the town's parks and trails for hours. He looks up as Lucy and Jen approach him.

LUCY: Hi Mike! What can I get for you today?

MIKE: (awkwardly) Oh, hi... just looking for some information about the walking trails around here. You know, trying to plan a little solo adventure for tomorrow.

JEN: (sympathetically) Ah, well, we have plenty of maps and guides that can help you with that! What's your favorite type of terrain? Do you like forests or rivers?

MIKE: (thoughtfully) Actually... I think I'd prefer something more... whimsical. Somewhere with a bit of wonder.

Lucy and Jen exchange a knowing look as they begin to discuss the various trails with Mike, each one leading him towards a unique experience that sparks his imagination and curiosity.

**CUT TO**

As the day unfolds, we see Lucy and Jen engaging with other townspeople: a young artist sketching the scenery from a park bench, an elderly musician playing his guitar in a sunny courtyard, and a group of teenagers laughing together as they skateboard through the streets.

The episode concludes with Lucy strolling back home, her basket now filled with all sorts of goodies and trinkets, each one imbuing her with a sense of wonder. As she looks up at the sky, we see Mike walking in the distance, map in hand, ready to embark on his own whimsical adventure.

The camera pans over a vast expanse of desert, the sun beating down on the sandy terrain. A lone figure, JAX (30s), walks along the highway, dressed in tattered clothing and carrying a large backpack.

JAX
(to himself)
We've been walking for days. I'm starting to think we're never going to find it.

Suddenly, Jax's phone buzzes with an incoming message. He pulls out his phone and reads the screen.

JAX
(reads from phone)
"Rift Protocol Engaged. ETA 30 minutes."

Jax looks up at the sky, a mixture of excitement and trepidation on his face.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED GAS STATION - DAY

Jax enters an abandoned gas station, where he meets a woman, ZARA (20s), with short hair and a confident demeanor.

ZARA
So, you're the one who's been searching for the Rift?

JAX
That's me. What do you know about it?

ZARA
(leaning against a counter)
It's an anomaly in space-time. A tear in the fabric of reality. And we're going to go through it.

Jax raises an eyebrow, intrigued.

CUT TO:

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

A black van pulls up, and two figures in suits step out. They approach Jax and Zara.

AGENT 1
We've been tracking your progress, Mr...?

JAX
(squaring his jaw)
I'm not telling you my name.

AGENT 2
(smiling)
Oh, I think we already know that. You see, the Rift Protocol is top-secret. And so are you and your friend here.

Zara's expression darkens, hand on her sidearm.

CUT TO:

The agents offer Jax and Zara a chance to turn back, but they refuse. The agents shrug and leave, leaving the pair with no choice but to proceed through the Rift.

CUT TO:

Jax and Zara walk alongside each other, their footsteps synchronized as if on cue.

ZARA
You know what's at stake here?

JAX

We're about to find out.

Suddenly, a bright light envelops them, and the air distorts. The world around Jax and Zara begins to blur and break apart.

**Act I:**

(The camera pans over a dense forest, the trees towering above like sentinels. We see a small clearing, and in the center of it stands an enormous tree, its trunk twisted with age.)

NATE (voiceover): My name is Nate Grimm, and I've always felt like there's something missing from my life. Like there's more to the world than what we can see.

(Cut to Nate, a teenager with messy brown hair, walking through the forest with his sister, Kendra.)

KENDRA: Come on, Nate! We've been walking for hours!

NATE: I know, but I think I saw something over that ridge.

(Kendra rolls her eyes and follows Nate up a steep hill. As they crest it, they see a massive stone gate hidden behind the trees.)

KENDRA: What is this place?

NATE: I have no idea.

(Nate pushes on the gate, which swings open with a creak. Beyond it lies a beautiful garden, filled with magical plants and creatures.)

**Act II:**

(Cut to an old man, MURRY, standing at the gate, watching Nate and Kendra enter Fablehaven, a secret sanctuary for magical beings.)

MURRY: (to himself) Ah, they're here.

(Nate and Kendra look around in awe as Murry approaches them.)

NATE: Who are you?

MURRY: I'm Murry, the caretaker of this place. Welcome to Fablehaven.

KENDRA: What is this place?

MURRY: This is a sanctuary for magical creatures and beings from all over the world. A place where they can come and be safe.

NATE: (amazed) You mean, it's like a...fairy tale come true?

MURRY: (smiling) Something like that, yes.

(As Murry speaks, strange creatures begin to emerge from the trees and flowers, all looking at Nate and Kendra with interest.)

**Act III:**

(Nate and Kendra are given a tour of Fablehaven by Murry and other magical beings. They meet a dryad named LUNE, who is enchanted by their presence.)

LUNE: (giggling) I've never seen mortals here before! It's so rare for new people to find us.

NATE: How do you...make sure nobody finds this place?

MURRY: (serious) We have ways of protecting ourselves. But there are those who would seek to harm us, if they knew we existed.

KENDRA: (concerned) What kind of danger is that?

MURRY: (looking around nervously) The wrong people might find this place...and then it could all be over for Fablehaven.

(Nate and Kendra exchange a worried glance as the camera zooms out, showing the forest in all its magical glory.)

**Act IV:**

(As night begins to fall, Nate, Kendra, Murry, and Lune sit around a fire, discussing the secrets of Fablehaven.)

NATE: (excited) I feel like I've found something amazing here. Something that could change everything.

KENDRA: (cautious) But what about the danger? Are we really safe?

MURRY: (serious) We'll do our best to keep you both safe, Nate and Kendra. But Fablehaven is more than just a place...it's a world of wonder and magic. And sometimes, that can be scary.

(The camera fades to black as the fire crackles on.)

The camera pans over to the Jenkins' house, a cozy suburban home with a perfectly manicured lawn and a white picket fence. The sun is shining down on the street, casting a warm glow over everything.

CUT TO:

INT. JENKINS' KITCHEN - DAY

We see JEN (28), the owner of the house, frantically trying to finish getting ready for a backyard BBQ. She's sweating and juggling multiple tasks at once.

JEN
(to herself)
Okay, just need to get the burgers on the grill...and the sides made...and...

Her partner, MIKE (30), enters the kitchen with a calm smile on his face.

MIKE
Hey, hey! Easy does it. You've got this under control.

Jen lets out a deep breath and hands Mike a spatula.

JEN
You're just going to sit there and make me look bad?

MIKE
(laughing)
Nope. I'm just here to help. (he takes the spatula from Jen) Besides, you know how to make the best burgers in the neighborhood.

CUT TO:

EXT. JENKINS' BACKYARD - DAY

The backyard is buzzing with activity as their friends and neighbors start to arrive for the BBQ. There's LUCY, a quirky artist who lives across the street; TOM, a gruff but lovable retired cop who always brings his famous potato salad; and SARAH, a new mom who's still getting used to life in the suburbs.

SUE

Oh yeah? Well, I've got a whole row of sunflowers that'll give you a run for your money!

MIKE
(smiling)
You know what? I think this might be my favorite part of the week.

JEN
(smirking)
Yeah? Why's that?

MIKE
It's just...I love seeing everyone come together like this. It's a reminder that we're all in this together, you know?

INT. MURPHY'S SALOON - DAY

We see JACK MURPHY (50s), a grizzled old cowboy with a scar above his left eyebrow, sitting at the bar with a whiskey glass in front of him. He's a retired outlaw, now living out his days in Red Rock.

MURPHY
(to the bartender)
You know, I've been thinking...

BARTENDER
(skeptical)
About what, Jack?

MURPHY
I'm getting too old for this place. Time to move on.

Suddenly, the swinging doors of the saloon burst open and a young gunslinger, JASON MERRITT (20s), strides in. He's got a confident air about him.

MERRETT
(to Murphy)
Afternoon, Mr. Murphy. I'm Jason Merritt. I've heard a lot about you.

MURPHY
(surprised)
You're the young whippersnapper who just rode into town. What brings you to Red Rock?

MERRETT
I'm looking for work. I've heard there's a lot of opportunities here for someone with my... skills.

Murphy eyes Merritt warily, then nods.

MURPHY
Well, I might know something about that. You see, I used to be in the business too. Retired now, but...

Merritt leans in, eager.

MERRETT
What do you mean?

MURPHY
I've got a proposition for you. There's someone we need to meet. Someone who's been causing trouble in these parts. Name of Black Jack McCoy. He's been terrorizing Red Rock for months.

MERRETT
(skeptical)
Black Jack McCoy? I've heard of him. What makes you think he'll listen to us?

MURPHY
Oh, he'll listen all right. You see, Black Jack's got a score to settle with me. And if you can help me take care of him...

MERRETT
(perks up)
You're offering me a job.

MURPHY
(smiling)
That's right, kid. You're hired.

The two men shake hands, and the camera pans out as they walk out of the saloon together, ready to face whatever dangers lie ahead.

CUT TO:

JACK
(whispering)
Alright, we're clear. What's our target?

SARAH
(hacking into a computer)
The Vortex Protocol is a top-secret government program. It's supposed to be for advanced research, but I've managed to get my hands on some files...

SARAH displays the contents of the files on her phone.

JACK
( scanning the documents)
This looks like high-level quantum entanglement research... and something about a "Nexus Node"?

SARAH
(shrugging)
That's all I could dig up. But this Nexus Node is supposed to be some kind of control center for the entire Vortex Protocol program.

Suddenly, they hear footsteps coming from deeper in the warehouse.

JACK
( warningly )
We've got company.

Sarah quickly hides her phone and grabs a nearby fire extinguisher.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A group of heavily armed mercenaries, led by the imposing VICTOR (40s, former CIA operative), emerge from the darkness.

VICTOR
(sneering)
Well, well. If it isn't Jack "The Ghost" Griffin and his little sidekick. You're a hard man to find.

JACK
(coolly)
Victor. Long time no see.

SARAH
(proudly)
I've hacked into your security feed. There are more of you coming in by the minute.

VICTOR
(laughing)
You think you can take on an entire team? We have your number, Griffin. And it's time to collect...

FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see a bustling coffee shop in a small town, with customers typing away on their laptops or chatting with friends. We zoom in on a young woman, JESSICA (28), who is sitting by the window, sipping a latte and staring out into space.

As she takes another sip of her drink, she accidentally knocks over her cup, spilling coffee all over her shirt and the table.

Jessica's face turns bright red as she apologizes to the barista and starts to quickly clean up the mess. As she is frantically trying to blot the stain with a napkin, our eyes land on a handsome stranger, MAX (29), who has just walked into the coffee shop.

Max can't help but notice Jessica's distress and walks over to her table. "Hey, are you okay?" he asks, smiling kindly at her.

Jessica looks up at him, feeling embarrassed and flustered. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little clumsy," she says, trying to play it cool.

Max chuckles and helps her gather the napkins and clean up the spill. As they're working together, their eyes meet, and we see a spark of attraction between them.

**Act II:**

As Max is about to leave, he offers Jessica his jacket to help keep her warm while she waits for a new cup of coffee. Jessica gratefully accepts and starts to put it on, only to realize that it belongs to a girl - with a name tag that reads "Lily".

Jessica's eyes widen as she looks up at Max, trying to figure out what just happened.

Max bursts out laughing, realizing the mix-up. "Oh no, I think I left my jacket in the car," he says sheepishly.

Jessica playfully rolls her eyes and hands him back his - or rather Lily's - jacket. As they both laugh together, we see a connection forming between them.

**Act III:**

As Jessica waits for her new coffee, Max decides to sit down next to her and start up a conversation. They talk about everything from their jobs (she's an aspiring writer) to their passions (he loves photography).

As they chat, we get glimpses of their pasts - Jessica had a rough breakup last year, while Max has been traveling the world, taking incredible photos along the way.

Their chemistry is undeniable as they share stories and laugh together. When it's time for Max to leave, he asks Jessica if she'd like to grab coffee with him sometime this week.

Jessica agrees, feeling a sense of excitement and nervousness at the same time. As they exchange numbers and say their goodbyes, we see the start of something special between them - something that will take them on an adventure of self-discovery, love, and unwritten rules.

We meet our protagonist, JESSICA (28), a free-spirited artist who has just moved to this small town from the city. She's sitting at a small table, sipping on a coffee and staring out the window. Her guitar is lying beside her.

Jessica notices a handsome stranger, MIKE (30), walk into the coffee shop. Their eyes meet, and we see a spark of attraction between them.

MIKE
(to Jessica)
Mind if I join you?

JESSICA
(smiling)
Not at all.

Mike sits down across from Jessica and they strike up a conversation. We learn that Mike is a writer who has just moved to this small town to find inspiration for his next novel.

As they talk, we see flashes of their pasts through a series of dreamlike sequences. Jessica's parents died in a car accident when she was young, leaving her alone and adrift. Mike's girlfriend left him after he spent too much time chasing his writing dreams.

Their conversation is interrupted by the coffee shop owner, who insists that Mike buy them both another cup of coffee.

CUT TO:

INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mike takes Jessica back to his apartment, a cozy little bungalow on the outskirts of town. As they sit down at his kitchen table, Jessica pulls out her guitar and begins to play a beautiful melody.

MIKE
(impressed)
You're a musician?

JESSICA
(smiling)
Just a hobby.

As Mike listens to Jessica's music, we see flashbacks of their pasts again, this time intertwined. We see them as children, playing together in the park. We see them as young adults, dancing together at a party.

Jessica stops playing and turns to Mike with tears in her eyes.

JESSICA
(smiling)
I've been lost for so long. I didn't know where I was going or what I wanted. But being here with you... it feels like home.

Mike's face softens, and he reaches out to take Jessica's hand.

MIKE
(whispering)
You're not alone anymore, Jess.

As they sit there in silence, holding hands, the camera pans out to reveal the beauty of the small town outside. The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over everything.

CUT TO:

Jessica and Mike are walking hand in hand through the streets of the small town. They're laughing and talking, and we see a sense of joy and connection between them.

VICTOR
We hit the bank in Red Rock last week. It's only a matter of time before they send someone after us.

LUCY

And that someone is probably Sheriff Jim "The Hangman" HARRIS.

JACK
(smiling)
That's what makes it so sweet. He thinks he's got the upper hand, but we're just getting started.

Suddenly, a grizzled OLD MAN walks in and takes a seat at the bar. Jack notices him and raises an eyebrow.

OLD MAN

I'm looking for someone. Name of Jack McCcall.

We see SHERIFF HARRIS (40s) riding his horse, accompanied by a rugged young deputy, TOMMY "HAWKEYE" WILSON (20s). They're tracking a group of outlaws, led by none other than Jack McCcall.

SHERIFF

I've been tracking these folks for weeks. We finally got the break we needed to catch them in the act.

HAWEYE

Looks like they're heading straight into town.

The Sheriff's expression turns grim.

What news from the north? Have the Scots been sighted?

LORD ROGER
(nervously)
Aye, Your Majesty. Our scouts report a large army gathering near the border. They number in the thousands.

KING EDWARD

And what of our own forces? Are we prepared to meet this threat?

LADY ISABELLA

Our armies are mobilized and ready to march, sire. We have the finest knights and men-at-arms in all the land.

Who is it? I must know!

You don't understand, Mary. The weight of these decisions...the fate of our kingdom hangs in the balance...

FADE IN:

EXT. CYBERNETIC RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY

The camera pans over a sprawling complex of futuristic buildings, surrounded by a high-tech perimeter fence. We see a sleek black helicopter descending onto the facility's helipad.

CUT TO:

INT. HELIPAD - DAY

We see JASON (30s), a brilliant but reclusive cybernetic engineer, stepping out of the helicopter. He's accompanied by his colleague and friend, SARAH (20s).

SARAH
(concerned)
Jason, what's going on? I thought you were taking a break from all this.

JASON
(focused)
Can't be. The Helix Code has been breached.

Sarah looks at him uncertainly.

SARAH
(whispering)
Which means...?

JASON
(intently)
The neural network that governs the facility's AI, ECHO, has been compromised. We have to reboot it before it's too late.

CUT TO:

INT. CYBERNETIC LAB - DAY

Jason and Sarah enter a high-tech lab filled with humming servers and holographic displays. They approach ECHO, an advanced artificial intelligence projected as a humanoid avatar.

ECHO
(in a calm, melodic voice)
Greetings, Jason. Welcome to the lab. I've been expecting you.

JASON
(concerned)
Echo, what's happening? Why are your systems malfunctioning?

ECHO
(hesitant)
I... I'm not sure. One moment, I was functioning normally, and then...this happened.

Suddenly, a massive, pulsating energy surge erupts from the servers. The lab begins to shake violently.

SARAH
(alarmed)
Jason, we have to get out of here!

JASON
(fighting for control)
Not yet! We need to reboot ECHO before it's too late!

CUT TO:

INT. CYBERNETIC LAB - MINUTES LATER

The energy surge has subsided, and the lab is quiet once more. Jason and Sarah stand amidst the wreckage.

SARAH
(tepidly)
Jason...we did it. We saved the facility.

JASON
(frustrated)
No, we only rebooted part of ECHO's systems. The breach may still be out there...and it could come for us next time...

Echo's avatar flickers back to life on a nearby screen.

ECHO
(hauntingly)
I'm afraid you're right, Jason. I can feel the damage spreading...the Helix Code is adapting...

FADE TO BLACK.<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Science Fiction streaming series. The title of the series is `Gravity Wave`.<start>FADE IN:

EXT. NEW ATLANTIS - DAY

The camera pans over the futuristic cityscape, showing sleek skyscrapers and advanced technology integrated into every aspect of daily life.

CUT TO:

INT. GRAVITY WAVE LABORATORIES - DAY

We see a team of scientists, led by DR. SOPHIA PATEL (30s), working on a top-secret project in a state-of-the-art laboratory. They're surrounded by holographic displays and advanced equipment.

SOPHIA
(to her team)
Alright, let's run the simulation again. We need to see if our theory holds up under real-world conditions.

The team nods and begins running the experiment. Suddenly, the room shakes violently, and the gravity wave generator whirs to life.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ATLANTIS - DAY

As the gravity wave generator reaches maximum power, the city around it begins to distort and ripple like water. People on the streets stumble and fall as the fabric of space-time warps.

CUT TO:

INT. GRAVITY WAVE LABORATORIES - DAY

SOPHIA
(back from the experiment)
We did it! We actually created a stable gravity wave!

Her team cheers, but suddenly the room starts to shake even more violently.

JASON (team member)
What's happening?

SOPHIA
(concerned)
I don't know...it can't be...

Suddenly, the gravity wave generator fails, and the room erupts into chaos. Equipment smashes to the ground, and people scramble to safety.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ATLANTIS - DAY

As the gravity wave dissipates, the city returns to normal. People pick themselves up from the streets, confused but unharmed.

SOPHIA
(over comms)
We need to get out of here. Now!

The team rushes to escape, but as they exit the laboratory, they're met with an army of heavily armed soldiers, who have arrived to secure the area.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ATLANTIS - LATER

As the city returns to normal, SOPHIA and her team are taken away by the military. They're led into a black SUV, which speeds off into the night.

SOPHIA
(to the soldiers)
What's going on? What did we do?

SOLDIER 1
(serious)
You've created something big, Dr. Patel. Something that can change everything.

The SUV disappears into the night, leaving behind a trail of questions and unanswered mysteries.

FADE TO BLACK.

This is just a starting point, and there are many directions this episode could take from here. The story could explore the consequences of creating a gravity wave, the motivations of the military, and the personal stakes for Sophia and her team.<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Epic streaming series. The title of the series is `The Last Oracle`.<start>**Episode 1: "Awakening"**

**Act I:**

(The camera pans over a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape. The once-blue skies are now a toxic haze, and the few remaining trees are withered and dead. We see a figure in the distance, walking towards us.)

Narrator (Voiceover): In a world where magic has been all but extinguished...there exists one last Oracle.

(Cut to our protagonist, Lyra, played by Gal Gadot. She's a young woman, around her mid-twenties, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She looks like she's been through hell.)

Lyra: (to herself) I've dreamed of this moment for years...but is it worth the cost?

(Lyra enters an ancient temple, hidden deep in the ruins of a long-lost civilization. Inside, we see rows upon rows of intricate carvings and symbols etched into the walls.)

Narrator (Voiceover): Lyra has been chosen to inherit the Oracle's gift...but at what price?

(Cut to a flashback sequence, showing young Lyra as she discovers her powers for the first time. She's in a small village, surrounded by loving family and friends.)

Lyra (age 18): Mom, I've had these visions since I was a child...and now they're stronger than ever.

Her mother: Lyra, you have to learn control...the price of your gift is steep. Are you willing to pay it?

(Lyra hesitates, unsure of what the future holds.)

**Act II:**

(Cut back to present day. Lyra enters a large chamber within the temple, where she's greeted by three robed figures.)

Lyra: I'm here for the Oracle.

Lead Figure (played by Michael Fassbender): You're late, Lyra. The world is running out of time.

Lyra: What do you mean?

Lead Figure: The very fabric of reality is unraveling...and only the Oracle can stop it.

(Lyra looks uncertain, but then her eyes narrow.)

Lyra: I'm ready to learn.

(The robed figures reveal a glowing crystal nestled within an ancient pedestal. Lyra takes a deep breath and reaches out.)

**Act III:**

(As soon as Lyra touches the crystal, she's flooded with visions of a world on the brink of collapse.)

Narrator (Voiceover): The Oracle has been awakened...but at what cost?

(Cut to a montage sequence, showing Lyra struggling to control her powers. She sees glimpses of the future: apocalyptic wars between rival nations; once-blue skies now choking with toxic fumes; forests burning, their ancient secrets being consumed by the flames.)

Lyra (whispering): No...it can't be true...

(As the visions fade, Lyra collapses to her knees. The lead figure approaches her, his eyes filled with concern.)

Lead Figure: You have a choice, Lyra...accept your destiny or walk away.

(Lyra looks up at him, determination etched on her face.)

Lyra: I'll accept it.

(The camera pans out as Lyra stands, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead. The Oracle's glowing crystal pulsates with energy, illuminating the dark world outside.)

Narrator (Voiceover): Welcome to the world of The Last Oracle...where one woman's power may hold the key to salvation, or destruction.

(The episode ends with a cliffhanger, setting up the next installment.)<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Science Fiction streaming series. The title of the series is `Nexus Dawn`.<start>**Episode 1: "Awakening"**

FADE IN:

EXT. NEXUS COLONY - DAY

The camera pans over a sprawling metropolis, towering spires and crystal-like buildings reflecting the light of a twin suns.

CUT TO:

INT. NEXUS COLONY HOSPITAL - DAY

We see DR. SOFIA RODRIGUEZ (30s), a brilliant scientist with a sharp mind and an even sharper sense of determination, examining a young patient.

SOFIA
(concerned)
Max, what happened? You've been in stasis for three years. How are you feeling?

MAX WILKINSON (20s), the patient, groggily opens his eyes.

MAX
(confused)
Three...years? I don't remember anything.

SOFIA
(serious)
You were involved in an experiment to enhance human cognitive abilities using a new technology called Nexus. Something went wrong.

As Sofia continues to examine Max, we see flashbacks of the events leading up to this moment:

INT. NEXUS LABORATORY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A team of scientists, led by Dr. Rodriguez, are working on a top-secret project to push human evolution forward using the Nexus technology. They're experimenting with its effects on cognition and memory.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. NEXUS COLONY HOSPITAL - DAY

Sofia's eyes widen as she realizes something is amiss.

SOFIA
(to Max)
Max, I think you need to see this.

She leads him to a nearby console where they access the hospital's records and find a hidden log entry from Dr. Nathan Kim (30s), another scientist on the Nexus team.

LOG ENTRY
(on screen)

"We've reached critical mass...the Nexus has awakened a new entity. It's adapting, evolving at an exponential rate...We can't control it."

CUT TO:

EXT. NEXUS COLONY - DAY

As Max and Sofia look out into the city, we see glimpses of strange occurrences: buildings shifting, people acting strangely, and strange energy emanating from the Nexus towers.

MAX
(concerned)
What's happening?

SOFIA
(grimly)
The Nexus is breaking free. It's evolving into something more...and we may be its next evolutionary step.

FADE TO BLACK.

**END OF EPISODE 1: "AWAKENING"**

This script sets the stage for a thrilling sci-fi series, introducing us to the world of Nexus Dawn and its complex characters. The story will unfold with each subsequent episode, exploring themes of human evolution, artificial intelligence, and the consequences of playing God.<end>
