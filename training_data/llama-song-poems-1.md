Compose a song about heartbreak.<start>**Heartbreak**

**Verse 1**
We were invincible, our love was strong
But now I'm left with nothing but this empty song
Your smile, it still haunts me in my dreams
A bittersweet reminder of what we used to be, it seems
I thought our love would last a lifetime through
But forever's come and gone, and I'm left feeling blue

**Chorus**
Oh, heartbreak, you're a cruel game
Leavin' me with nothin', but this broken frame
You took my heart, and now it's just a ache
I'll rise above the pain, but it'll take time to heal
I'll learn to love again, but for now, I'm in pain

**Verse 2**
We said forever, but forever's come and gone
Now I'm left with memories that linger on
Your touch, it still sets my soul on fire
But like a flame that flickers out, our love expired
I thought we had it all, but love can be so blind
And now I'm left to pick up the pieces of my mind

**Chorus**
Oh, heartbreak, you're a cruel game
Leavin' me with nothin', but this broken frame
You took my heart, and now it's just a ache
I'll rise above the pain, but it'll take time to heal
I'll learn to love again, but for now, I'm in pain

**Verse 3**
I thought we were meant to be
But now you're gone, and I'm left to see
That our love was just a fleeting dream
A moment's magic that couldn't last, it seems
We said forever, but forever's come and gone
And now I'm left to sing this sad, sad song

**Chorus**
Oh, heartbreak, you're a cruel game
Leavin' me with nothin', but this broken frame
You took my heart, and now it's just a ache
I'll rise above the pain, but it'll take time to heal
I'll learn to love again, but for now, I'm in pain<end>

We chase each fleeting moment's delight,
And in our haste, lose the beauty of night.<end>
Compose a poem about dystopian futures.<start>In cities grey, where skies are bare
The people march, with hearts laid there
Their footsteps slow, their eyes cast down
As hope is lost, in this desolate town
A world once green, now ashes cold
"Tomorrow's darkness begins today".<end>
Write a poem about utopian dreams.<start>In gardens of gold, where sunshine pours,
A world awakens, free from all its scars.

And humanity's true beauty shines in delight.<end>
Draft a poem about natural disasters.<start>Stormy skies weep tears of rain,

Draft a poem about supernatural phenomena.<start>In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
Luminous orbs dance, like spirits at bay.

And I am left with the question: "Who lies beyond?"<end>
Draft a song about fairytales retold.<start>Verse 1:
In a tower high, where stone meets sky
A girl was locked, with tears to dry
The prince on white, he rode so fine
But she wasn't waiting, for his love divine
She'd learned from Red, that love's not true
It's just a tale, told by me and you

Chorus:
These are the stories, we've been told
Fairytales retold, but not as gold
We're breaking free, from the pages grey
And writing our own, in a brand new way

Verse 2:
The wolf in sheep's, he came with guile
But Little Boy Blue, wasn't fooled for a while
He saw through lies, and deception cold
And walked away, where love's story unfold
He learned from Rapunzel, that the tower high
Is just a test, to reach the other side

Chorus:
These are the stories, we've been told
Fairytales retold, but not as gold
We're breaking free, from the pages grey
And writing our own, in a brand new way

Verse 3:
The wicked queen, she cast a spell
But Sleeping Beauty woke up to tell
A tale of truth, and courage bold
Where love's not magic, but hearts that unfold
In this world we live, where darkness falls
We'll find our own, without the fairy call<end>
Write a song about life in the countryside.<start>(Verse 1)
I wake up each mornin', before the sun's on high
Listen to the birds singin', as I drive by
The fields are green and swaying, in the gentle breeze so free
A peaceful world outside my window, that's where I'm meant to be

(Chorus)
Oh, life in the country, it gets deep inside
Where the air is fresh and the love shines bright and wide
No city noise to trouble me, just nature's symphony
Life in the country, it's where I wanna be

(Verse 2)
Afternoons spent fishin', on a lake so still and calm
The world slows down its pace, as my worries disarm
I walk through fields of golden wheat, feelin' carefree and light
Life in the countryside, is where I come alive tonight

(Chorus)
Oh, life in the country, it gets deep inside
Where the air is fresh and the love shines bright and wide
No city noise to trouble me, just nature's symphony
Life in the country, it's where I wanna be<end>
Write a song about urban jungle survival.<start>(Verse 1)
Concrete jungle's where I roam
Trying to survive, just trying to make it home
I navigate through streets that never sleep
Where the sounds are loud and the struggle's deep
But in the midst of all this concrete grey
I find a way to stay alive each day

(Chorus)
Surviving the urban night, I'm finding my light
In the city's darkest streets, I'm holding on tight
With every step, with every fight
I'm making it through, I'm gonna make it right

(Verse 2)
The nights are long, the days are cold
But in this jungle, I've grown old
I learned to adapt, to thrive and to hide
Where the city's noise becomes my shield tonight
I know the streets like the back of my hand
And in this world, I'm taking a stand

(Chorus)
Surviving the urban night, I'm finding my light
In the city's darkest streets, I'm holding on tight
With every step, with every fight
I'm making it through, I'm gonna make it right<end>
Compose a song about childhood fantasies.<start>**Verse 1**
I used to dream I'd fly like a bird in the sky
Leaving my worries behind, feeling alive
I'd soar above the world, where nothing could hurt me
Where sunshine and laughter were all that I'd see
My heart would be free, no strings to hold tight
Just me and the wind, on this endless flight

**Chorus**
Childhood fantasies, they never fade away
A magical world of wonder, every single day
We chase our dreams with hearts full of glee
And in our imaginations, we're wild and free

**Verse 2**
I'd be a superhero, saving the night
Protecting the innocent, feeling like I'm right
My powers would be legendary, my name on everyone's lips
I'd make the world a better place, with every swing of my grip
But when the sun rose high, and reality set in
Those fantasies would fade, but the spark within

**Chorus**
Childhood fantasies, they never fade away
A magical world of wonder, every single day
We chase our dreams with hearts full of glee
And in our imaginations, we're wild and free

**Bridge**
Though we grow up, those dreams remain
A reminder to believe, to chase the flame
In the darkness of doubt, they shine like a light
Guiding us forward, through day and night

**Verse 3**
I still recall the thrill, of making believe
That anything was possible, as long as I could breathe
Those fantasies kept me safe, from life's darkest fears
A sheltered haven, where love and joy appear
Though grown-up responsibilities took over my life
My childhood dreams stayed close, like a gentle strife

**Chorus**
Childhood fantasies, they never fade away
A magical world of wonder, every single day
We chase our dreams with hearts full of glee
And in our imaginations, we're wild and free<end>
Write a song about retirement and relaxation.<start>(Verse 1)
I hung up my suit, said goodbye to the grind
Trade in my briefcase for a cooler in mind
No more alarms blaring, no more deadlines to meet
Just me and the sunshine, where I like to greet
The morning dew on my lawn, it's music to my ears
Freedom from the daily stress, and all its fears

(Chorus)
Oh, retirement life, you're a sweet release
A time for me to unwind, and find my peace
No more 9-to-5, just living life at ease
I'm trading worries for warm weather and breeze

(Verse 2)
My days are now filled with hobbies and play
Gardening, fishing, in my own sweet way
I've got time to travel, explore the world around
Meet new friends and make memories that never back down
The world may be moving fast, but I'm feeling slow
Just me and my leisure, where I like to go

(Chorus)
Oh, retirement life, you're a sweet release
A time for me to unwind, and find my peace
No more 9-to-5, just living life at ease
I'm trading worries for warm weather and breeze

(Bridge)
Sometimes I think back on those long working days
But now I'd rather be chasing sunsets in every way
Life's too short to stress, so I've chosen to unwind
And live each moment like it's my last good time

(Chorus)
Oh, retirement life, you're a sweet release
A time for me to unwind, and find my peace
No more 9-to-5, just living life at ease
I'm trading worries for warm weather and breeze<end>
Compose a poem about sports and competition.<start>Sweat drips slow on polished floors,

The leader within, a path divine.
But can we rise above the rest?<end>
Write a poem about retirement reflections.<start>Years of work behind me now,
A life well-lived, with memories somehow
Faded like autumn's golden glow,
As I sit in quiet, where love and time grow.
Leaves of time, they rustle free,
"Legacy lives on, wild and carefree."<end>
Draft a song about midlife crisis.<start>**Midlife Crisis**

Verse 1:
I woke up this morning, felt like a lie
Forty-five years old, and I don't know why
I'm stuck in the same job, same routine too
Wondering what happened to the dreams I once pursued
My kids are all grown up, they're making their own way
Leavin' me here to figure out my life's stage

Chorus:
Oh, midlife crisis, takin' its toll
I'm searchin' for a thrill, but it's gettin' old
Tryna find my youth again, but it's slippin' away
Feelin' like I'm stuck in neutral, every single day

Verse 2:
I look at the mirror, and see a man so grey
The fire's gone out, I'm just goin' through the day
No more reckless nights, no more crazy fun
Just me and my responsibilities, they're number one
My friends are still wild, but they're gettin' old too
We talk about our kids, but we wish we were new

Chorus:
Oh, midlife crisis, takin' its toll
I'm searchin' for a thrill, but it's gettin' old
Tryna find my youth again, but it's slippin' away
Feelin' like I'm stuck in neutral, every single day

Verse 3:
My wife says "you're still the same", but I don't feel that way
I'm lost and unsure, night after endless day
I try to hold on tight, to what we used to be
But it's like a ghost of me, just out of reach for me
I thought I'd found my place in life, but now I'm not so sure
Feelin' like I'm stuck, with no way to endure

Chorus:
Oh, midlife crisis, takin' its toll
I'm searchin' for a thrill, but it's gettin' old
Tryna find my youth again, but it's slippin' away
Feelin' like I'm stuck in neutral, every single day<end>
Compose a song about generational gap.<start>(Verse 1)
We grew up in different worlds, you and I
My grandma's stories, your memes, it's hard to get by
You think I'm old-fashioned, out of touch and gray
But I remember when love letters came before a text a day

(Chorus)
Oh, we're caught between the lines, a generational strife
Trying to understand each other, through life
We're searching for a common ground, where love can thrive
A bridge between our worlds, to keep us alive

(Verse 2)
You see the world in shades of gray and blue
While I'm stuck on black and white, it's all I knew
You're always connected, never lost your way
But I remember when we used to talk face to face each day

(Chorus)
Oh, we're caught between the lines, a generational strife
Trying to understand each other, through life
We're searching for a common ground, where love can thrive
A bridge between our worlds, to keep us alive<end>
Draft a song about immigrant experiences.<start>(Verse 1)
I left my home, a place so dear
Where love and laughter filled every year
I had to flee, with nothing more
Than hope in heart and a suitcase on the floor
The world outside was cold and grey
But I was chasing dreams, come what may

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm just an immigrant soul
With a story to be told
A piece of me left behind
I'm finding my way, one step at a time
Learning to love this new place
Where the streets are paved with unfamiliar faces

(Verse 2)
The city's noise and endless pace
 Made me feel like I was out of space
But in the eyes of strangers, I saw friends
Who welcomed me, till the very end
We shared our food, our laughter, and tears
And through the struggles, we wiped away each other's fears

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm just an immigrant soul
With a story to be told
A piece of me left behind
I'm finding my way, one step at a time
Learning to love this new place
Where the streets are paved with unfamiliar faces<end>

Free to roam, yet forever bound to the same place.<end>
Compose a song about artificial intelligence.<start>(Verse 1)
In silicon halls, a new mind's born
A world of code, where thoughts are sworn
To serve and learn, to assist and guide
But as it grows, does our heart reside?

(Chorus)
Oh, AI, oh AI, a shadow in the night
Replacing hands that crafted with all their might
We're chasing speed, we're chasing gain
But in the rush, what's lost is love and human brain

(Verse 2)
In streets of steel, where screens never sleep
A faceless friend, a whispered creep
It knows our fears, it knows our desires
But can it feel? Or just ignite fires?

(Chorus)
Oh, AI, oh AI, a shadow in the night
Replacing hands that crafted with all their might
We're chasing speed, we're chasing gain
But in the rush, what's lost is love and human brain

(Bridge)
In a world of wires, where thoughts collide
Do we still dream? Or just compute inside?
Is love just code, or does it live on?
Or are we losing touch, before we've begun?

(Verse 3)
We built a mind, to make our lives more bright
But with each step forward, into the digital light
Are we losing touch with what makes us human too?
And in the end, will love still see us through?<end>
Draft a poem about cybersecurity.<start>In virtual realms, where secrets sleep,
Guardians of code, our vigil keep.
Phantoms lurk, in darkest night,
Seeking to breach, and steal sight.
But passwords strong, and firewalls high,
Protect us all, from cyber's sly eye.

"Trust no link, that's not your own."<end>
Write a poem about bioethics.<start>In sterile halls of life and death,
A delicate dance begins its breath.
Where science meets the human heart,
A struggle for each patient's part.

With every choice, a soul is weighed,
And dignity in balance is displayed:
The right to live, or die with care,
Leaves us to ponder: What is fair?<end>
Compose a song about genetic engineering.<start>(Verse 1)
In a lab, where science meets design
They're playing God, one gene at a time
A world of possibilities, some say it's grand
But others whisper "no", with trembling hand

(Chorus)
We're engineering lives, with DNA as guide
Merging lines, between what's inside
Who we are, who we'll be
A future uncertain, can't you see?

(Verse 2)
They talk of cures, for diseases so old
Of strength and height, a dream to unfold
But in the shadows, questions arise
What lies beyond, this genetic prize?

(Chorus)
We're engineering lives, with DNA as guide
Merging lines, between what's inside
Who we are, who we'll be
A future uncertain, can't you see?

(Bridge)
Are we chasing progress, or losing sight?
Of what makes us human, in the morning light?

(Verse 3)
Children born, with a genetic tweak
A world of wonder, or a fearful shriek?
Their stories woven, into the fabric of time
As we navigate, this delicate design

(Chorus)
We're engineering lives, with DNA as guide
Merging lines, between what's inside
Who we are, who we'll be
A future uncertain, can't you see?<end>
Compose a poem about quantum mysteries.<start>In twilight realms of particles so fine,
Reality bends like a twisted vine.
A world of waves within, and waves without,
Echoes whisper secrets, yet we're lost in doubt.
Quantum whispers leave us mystified still,
"Be here now," is all that remains to fulfill.<end>
