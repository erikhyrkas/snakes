Hey, Jenny. We got a new one.

We'll do everything we can to find out what happened to Sarah.

Jessica: "Just looking for something to do while I get settled. Maybe some part-time work at the station?"

Tom looks hesitant, then leans in.

Tom: "Listen, Jess...I gotta be honest with you. There's been some weird stuff going on since you left. People whispering about a guy who doesn't exist."

Jessica raises an eyebrow, intrigued.

Suddenly, Jessica receives a mysterious letter in the mail:

"Dear Jess,

Welcome home.

Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight if you want answers about your mom's past.

Yours,
A friend"

Man, I got a bad feeling about this town. Folks seem on edge.

JACK
(shrugging)
Just the usual tensions between the townspeople and the cattle barons, Lucas.

Suddenly, the saloon doors swing open and a menacing figure strides in. It's SHERIFF JENKINS (40s), a brutal and corrupt lawman with a grudge against Jack.

SHERIFF JENKINS
(sneering)
Well, well, well. Look what we got here. The notorious "Riverview Rambler" himself, Jack. Thought you'd run outta town by now.

Sheriff, I'll be keepin' an eye out for them cattle rustlers, even if you ain't gonna do nothin'.

(time-stressed)
Timekeeper, thank you for joining us. We have an emergency on our hands.

JACK
(ready to spring into action)
What's the situation?

DIRECTOR ZARA
(hologram displays flickering behind her)
Our latest time-traveling expedition has gone awry. A rogue agent, code-named "The Renegade," has traveled back from the year 2050 and is wreaking havoc on our present.

I'm on it. Time to put a stop to this temporal turbulence.

The Timekeeper expertly navigates the cityscape, dodging debris and leaping over obstacles to stay hot on The Renegade's heels. Finally, they converge in a deserted alleyway.

You're just a relic of the past, Timekeeper.

JACK

MIKE (40s)

Jim, we've been over this. You're not funny.

JIM

What are you talking about? I'm hilarious!

SARAH (20s), the club's president and self-proclaimed " queen bee," interrupts.

SARAH
Okay, let's take a vote. Who thinks Jim should join the Last Laughers Club?

The comedians all raise their hands except for one.

STEVE (30s)

Yeah, because nothing says "comedy gold" like a guy who does impressions of his cat.

JIM

Hey, my cat is a comedic genius!

SARAH

Yeah, I guess you're right. I just feel like I let everyone down.

Dude, you were so bad that the hecklers in the audience started laughing at you... and they weren't even trying to be mean!

The group bursts out laughing, and Jim can't help but join in.

INT. LAST LAUGHERS CLUB - LATER

Jim is back on stage, this time with a new bit. However, he's still struggling to get it together.

JIM

And then... I went to the doctor and he said...

Suddenly, Jim trips and falls off the stage, landing in a trash can.

The audience erupts into laughter, and Jim's friends are in hysterics.

Jen gets up from her seat and walks over to the counter, where her friend MIKE (29) is trying to order coffee.

MIKE
(frustrated)
I just want a simple cappuccino! Is that too much to ask?

BARISTA
( apologetic )
Sorry, buddy. We're having some issues with our milk supplier. It's all about the foam today...

Mike looks crestfallen as Jen intervenes.

JEN
(laughing)
Don't worry, Mike. I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.

The barista hands Mike a makeshift cappuccino made from almond milk and steamed water. He takes a tentative sip.

We see AYAZ (30s), a young and ambitious merchant from the kingdom of Mongolstan, haggling with a group of traders over the price of fine silk fabrics.

AYAZ
(desperate)
Come now, brothers! I'm willing to give you a fair price for these exquisite silks. They're worth every penny!

The traders confer among themselves before responding.

FIRST TRADER
( leaning in close )
Listen, Ayaz, we can do better than that. We know the value of those silks, and we won't be taken advantage of by some young upstart from Mongolstan.

AYAZ
(smiling wryly)
I'm not just any merchant, my friends. I have connections at court. If you don't agree to a fair price now, who knows when or if you'll ever find buyers for these fine silks?

The traders exchange nervous glances before finally agreeing on a price.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAMARKAND - DAY

Ayaz rides his horse through the streets of Samarkand, accompanied by his loyal servant and friend, KHAZRA (40s).

KHAZRA
(looking around warily)
Master Ayaz, be careful. The Mongol invasion has left many tribes in turmoil. We shouldn't have ventured this far south.

AYAZ
(calmly)
We're just traders, Khazra. We mean no harm. Besides, the Mongols need trade to survive. They won't bother us.

As they ride, a group of nomadic tribesmen on horseback approach them. Ayaz recognizes one of them as a local leader, QUTUBUDDIN (50s).

KHAZRA
(alarmed)
Master Ayaz! It's Qutubuddin!

AYAZ
(calmly)
Greetings, Qutubuddin! We've brought fine silks to trade.

QUTUBUDIN
(skeptical)
What business do you have here? This is a time of war and famine. Why should I care about your precious silks?

Ayaz explains the value of the silk trade in times of conflict, and how it can help the nomadic tribes recover from their losses.

Qutubuddin invites Ayaz to join him for dinner, where they discuss the terms of a potential trade agreement. Over cups of hot tea, Ayaz reveals his true intentions: he plans to use the silk trade as leverage to secure favors from the Mongol emperor.

QUTUBUDIN
(smirking)
You drive hard bargains, young Ayaz. I like that in a merchant. But remember, I have my own interests at stake here. You'll need to be careful not to overstep yourself.

Ayaz nods thoughtfully, understanding the delicate balance of power between them.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAMARKAND - NIGHT

As Ayaz and Khazra prepare to leave Samarkand, they're approached by a mysterious figure: a beautiful young woman named ZARIFA (20s). She hands Ayaz a small package containing a note with cryptic instructions.

ZARIFA
(whispering)
Be careful, Ayaz. There are those who would seek to undermine your business interests. Trust no one but Khazra.

Ayaz looks at the note and nods, tucking it into his sash. As they ride away from Samarkand, he turns back to Khazra with a look of concern.

AYAZ

I found some decent gear, but I think we should be careful. There's a rumor going around that there's a new Imperial commander in the area...one who's not afraid to use magic.

NAMIRA

Magic? That's just a myth.

That's what they want you to think. Trust me, I've heard stories from people who've seen it firsthand.

The group huddles around a makeshift fire, discussing their next move. We see ARIN (30), the group's leader and Namira's older brother, speaking in hushed tones.

ARIN
We need to get back to the windsong stronghold, regroup and plan our next move. The Empire's tightening its grip on the Plains, and we can't let them crush us like this.

NAMIRA
( firm)
I agree with Arin. We need to fall back and reassess our position. But I also think we should try to gather more information about this new commander...and what kind of magic they might be using.

Kaelin looks at Namira, a look of concern on his face.

KAELIN
Are you thinking of going after her, yourself?

NAMIRA
(nods)
If it means getting the upper hand against the Empire, I'm willing to take that risk.

We meet our hero, U.S. Marshal WILLIAM "BILL" TAYLOR (50s), a rugged and fair-minded lawman with a strong sense of justice. He's sitting at his desk, going over some paperwork.

BILL
(to his deputy)
I'm tellin' you, Jed, this town needs a fresh start. We've got outlaws comin' in from all sides, lookin' to stir up trouble.

DEPUTY JED (30s), Bill's trusted sidekick, nods in agreement.

JED
What we need is someone with some real authority comin' through, Marshal. Someone who can set an example for the rest of us.

Suddenly, a knock at the door interrupts them. It's Abigail, the local sheriff's daughter (20s), who's also Bill's close friend and confidante.

ABIGAIL
Marshal Taylor! I need to speak with you about my father. He's in a right ol' bind this time.

BILL
What seems to be the trouble, Abby?

ABIGAIL
(sheepishly)
Well...he got himself into an...arrangement with one of the local ranchers. A Mr. McCoy. Word is, there was a shipment of cattle that went missin', and my dad's name is on it.

CUT TO:

INT. MONTY'S SALOON - DAY

Monty (40s), the owner of the local saloon and Bill's close friend, greets him warmly as he enters.

MONTY
Hey, Marshal! What can I get for ya?

BILL
Just a whiskey, Monty. And some information. I'm lookin' into the missing cattle.

MONTY
(smirking)
Well, you might want to talk to Mr. McCoy. He's been makin' himself right at home on that ranch.

CUT TO:

EXT. MCCOY RANCH - DAY

Bill and Jed arrive at the McCoy Ranch, where they meet a gruff but affable rancher named JASPER (50s).

JASPER
Can I help you boys with somethin'?

BILL
We're here about the missing cattle, Mr. McCoy. We understand there was an arrangement made between you and Sheriff Langley.

JASPER
(sneering)
That's a mighty big accusation, Marshal. I think you'll find that Sheriff Langley is just tryin' to do what's best for this town.

BILL
I'm afraid we're gonna have to take a closer look at that arrangement, Mr. McCoy.

CUT TO:

INT. GUNSMOKE JUSTICE OFFICE - DAY

Bill and Jed return from the ranch, looking grim-faced.

JED
Well, Marshal? What'd you find out?

BILL
(squaring his jaw)
Let's just say I've got a few more questions to ask Sheriff Langley. And Mr. McCoy for that matter.

CUT TO:

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Bill confronts Sheriff Langley (50s) about the missing cattle and his arrangement with Mr. McCoy.

SHERIFF LANGLEY
(sheepishly)
Now, Bill...I was just tryin' to help out a friend...

BILL
(sternly)
You were makin' deals behind my back and compromisin' this town's integrity! That's not what I'm here for, Sheriff!

CUT TO:

EXT. DODGE CITY - DAY

The people of Dodge City are gathered in the town square as Bill confronts Sheriff Langley about his transgressions.

BILL
(to the crowd)
I know we've all got our own ways and means of gettin' by. But when it comes to doin' what's right, we gotta stand together! I'm not gonna let anyone undermine this town's justice!

As the townspeople rally behind Bill, Sheriff Langley slinks away in defeat.

CUT TO:

INT. GUNSMOKE JUSTICE OFFICE - DAY

Bill and Jed sit at their desks, victorious but weary from the long day.

BILL
(sighing)
You know, sometimes doin' what's right is harder than shootin' straight.

JED
(laughing)
That's why they call you Marshal Taylor, sir!

The camera pans out as Bill smiles, knowing he's made a difference in this wild and woolly town of Dodge City.

Sarah, I'm telling you, this guy is clean. I've been digging for hours and there's nothing.

SARAH (V.O.)
Jason, be careful. You don't know what we're dealing with here.

Sarah hesitates before responding.

SARAH (V.O.)
Just be careful, okay?

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S OFFICE - DAY

Jason hangs up his phone and looks around the cluttered office. He's a bit of a slob, but he knows where everything is. Sarah enters the room, looking worried.

SARAH
(concerned)
What did she say?

JASON
(sitting down behind his desk)
She wants me to be careful.

SARAH
(nodding)
Good.

Sarah hands Jason a folder containing information on the missing person's case.

JASON
(reading through the file)
Okay, so we've got a 25-year-old woman named Emily who went missing three days ago. No signs of foul play or anything suspicious.

SARAH
(frowning)
And no connection to any known organized crime groups?

JASON
(shaking his head)
Nothing.

Sarah nods and they both sit back in their chairs, contemplating the case.

CUT TO:

Jason and Sarah arrive at Emily's apartment complex. They meet with Emily's best friend, LUCY (20s), who is frantic.

LUCY
(panicked)
Please, you have to find her! Emily would never just leave like this.

JASON
(sympathetic)
We'll do everything we can, okay?

Lucy nods and hands them a photo of Emily.

SARAH
(examining the photo)
She looks... happy. Do you know what she was doing before she went missing?

LUCY

No, I don't. She just disappeared one day.

And what time is it now?

JASON

That's our guy.

As they approach him, he turns out to be Emily's brother, RYAN (30s). But something doesn't seem right.

RYAN
(smirking)
Well, well. Look what we've got here.

SARAH
(skeptical)
Ryan, what are you doing? You're supposed to be cooperating with us.

RYAN
(shrugging)
Oh, I'm cooperating all right.

Suddenly, Ryan pulls out a gun and points it at Jason and Sarah.

JASON

Ryan, put the gun down. We're not going anywhere.

But as they turn to leave, we see something that makes our skin crawl...

CUT TO:

INT. UNDERGROUND HIDEOUT - DAY

We find ourselves in a cramped, makeshift shelter beneath the city's surface. A small group of survivors, led by the resourceful and determined MAYA (30s), huddle around a holographic display projecting an image of the Earth from space.

MAYA
(serious)
Alright, we have confirmation that the Phoenix Initiative was indeed responsible for the catastrophic event known as "The Great Reckoning."

Kael, the group's tech expert, nods in agreement. He gestures to the hologram.

KAEL
That's not all, Maya. The data suggests there were... anomalies present during the Reckoning.

Maya's eyes narrow.

MAYA
Explain.

CUT TO:

INT. KAEL'S WORKSTATION - DAY

Kael frantically types away on his console as Maya watches over his shoulder. A 3D model of a strange, alien-like device materializes in front of them.

KAEL
This is the "Nexus Key". It's an artifact rumored to be connected to the Phoenix Initiative's research into harnessing the Earth's quantum energy.

MAYA
What does it do?

KAEL
(uneasy)
It... rewrites reality. But at a terrible cost, if we don't shut it down before it's too late.

Maya looks up from the hologram, a resolute glint in her eye.

MAYA
Alright. We'll go to New Eden. Find the Nexus Key and stop it before it destroys everything that's left of humanity.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW EDEN - DAY

The group sets out across the ruined cityscape, navigating through rubble-strewn streets and avoiding roving gangs of marauders. As they journey deeper into the heart of New Eden, they stumble upon a heavily fortified compound hidden behind an imposing wall.

Maya consults with her team before making a decision.

MAYA
(whispering)
Alright, we go in hot. Follow my lead.

EMILY
(skeptical)
So, you're saying you had nothing to do with the murder of your business partner, Alex Taylor?

JAMES
(shrugging)
I've already told you, Emily. I was at home that night, sleeping. My alibi's rock solid.

EMILY
(doubtful)
Rock solid? Really? Because from what I can see, your 'rock solid' alibi is a 17-year-old girl who claims to have been watching Netflix with you... and she's now missing.

JAMES
(surprised)
What are you talking about?

EMILY
(leaning in)
Don't play dumb, James. We know your girlfriend went missing after we brought her in for questioning. Now, either you're involved in Alex's murder, or you had something to do with her disappearance.

James looks taken aback by the accusation.

Emily and her partner, Detective Mark Davis (40), step out of a police car, eyes scanning the crowded street.

MARK

He does... but there's something not adding up. I think we're looking at a larger game here.

Mark raises an eyebrow, intrigued by Emily's tone.

Emily paces back and forth in her small apartment, phone pressed to her ear. She listens for a moment before responding.

EMILY
(frustrated)
Come on, Mike... this is ridiculous! I need you to dig deeper into Alex Taylor's business dealings. I have a feeling there's something connected to James Reed...

Emily's eyes flicker towards the window as she hears a noise outside. She quickly hangs up and approaches the door.

Detective Tom Hernandez (35) speaks up.

TOM

How does this connect to the other murders in the city?

EMILY

We're not just talking about a single case here. I think we have a serial killer on our hands, with connections that reach far beyond this department...

CUT TO:

INT. CPD INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Emily sits across from James again.

EMILY

James... I need to ask you something. Did you know Alex was investigating something before he died?

Don't lie to me, James. We have evidence...

Yes. We need to take this off-radar and investigate further.

Suddenly, the door bursts open and DAVE (30), the lovable but annoying founder of Prank Wars Inc., walks in with a huge grin on his face.

DAVE
Alright everyone! Gather 'round. We've got two new recruits joining the team!

The camera pans to reveal our new characters: LUCY (25) and MIKE (27). Lucy is a bright-eyed optimist, while Mike is a slacker with a thick beard.

LUCY
(excitedly)
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to be here! I've always loved pranks!

MIKE
(sarcastically)
Yeah, because nothing says "fun" like getting repeatedly sprayed with water and then having it recorded on YouTube.

DAVE
(calling out from the back of the room)
Okay, okay, let's get started. Today's mission is to prank our arch-nemesis, Mr. Johnson. He's been a pain in the butt for years, so it's time we take him down.

JASON
(skeptical)
Another revenge prank? Really Dave?

DAVE
(smiling mischievously)
Oh, this one's going to be good. Mike and Lucy, you're with me on this one.

Lucy looks thrilled, while Mike just shrugs and mutters under his breath.

Dave, Mike, and Lucy are huddled outside Mr. Johnson's office, discussing their plan of attack.

Okay, so we're going to fill his stapler with Jell-O...

MIKE
(sarcastically)
Oh boy, that sounds super original.

LUCY
(ignoring Mike's sarcasm)
And then, I'll hide behind the plant and jump out at him!

DAVE

That's the ticket! Mike, you're in charge of getting us in and out undetected.

Mike just rolls his eyes and pushes open the door to Mr. Johnson's office.

Hey, don't be too hard on them. They're new recruits!

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a sweeping vista of wind-tossed sea and rugged coastline, as a narrator speaks in a low, urgent tone.

NARRATOR (V.O)
In the world of Tenria, where the skies are perpetually torn apart by the very fabric of reality, the balance of power is about to be shattered...

The camera zooms in on a small fishing village, where we see a young woman, LYRA (25), standing at the edge of the water. She's dressed in worn leather armor and carries a sturdy-looking sword at her side.

LYRA
(to herself)
It's been five years since I left this place. Five years since... everything changed.

Suddenly, a massive storm cloud erupts on the horizon, its leading edge tearing through the village like a scythe. Lyra's eyes widen as she takes in the sheer scale of the tempest.

NARRATOR (V.O)
This is no ordinary storm...

**Act II:**

As the storm intensifies, Lyra's thoughts are interrupted by a commotion at the town square. A group of rough-looking men, led by the burly GORM (30), have arrived on horseback, seeking shelter from the tempest.

GORM
(to the villagers)
We've come to help! We'll get you all to safety!

But as they form up to flee, a massive wave crashes over the village, threatening to engulf them. Lyra leaps into action, drawing her sword and fighting to protect her friends.

LYRA
(through gritted teeth)
You're not going anywhere until we figure out what's causing this storm!

As she fights off a group of panicked villagers who are trying to flee, Lyra catches sight of something strange: the storm seems to be taking on a... human shape.

**Act III:**

The camera zooms in on the "storm-shape", which takes form as a towering figure with skin like rough-hewn stone and eyes that burn with an inner fire. This is ARKE, an ancient being said to embody the raw power of the Tempest.

ARKE
(in a voice like thunder)
Lyra... child of Tenria...

The villagers cower in fear as Lyra steps forward, her sword at the ready.

LYRA
(through gritted teeth)
What do you want from us?

ARKE
(smiling)
I have come to seek a balance. The tempests that rage across this world are growing stronger... and I fear they will soon consume everything...

As Arke speaks, the storm around them seems to be building in power, and Lyra feels an unsettling connection to the ancient being.

**Act IV:**

The episode ends with a cliffhanger: Lyra is faced with a choice that will decide the fate of her world. Will she join forces with Arke to find a balance between the tempests and the land? Or will she choose to fight against this new threat, no matter the cost?

As the camera fades to black, we see a title card:

Inside the truck, we meet our heroes: JACK (30s), a grizzled adventurer with a troubled past; SARAH (20s), his partner and tech expert; and LUCAS (40s), an eccentric billionaire with a taste for danger.

JACK

Alright, this is the last stretch. We should hit the extraction point by sundown.

SARAH
(fiddling with her comms device)
Roger that, Jack. I'm reading some strange energy signatures ahead. Looks like we're not alone out here.

LUCAS
(smirking)
That's what makes it fun, kids.

The truck hits a pothole, and the camera shakes violently as they crest a dune.

**Act II:**

As they descend into a hidden valley, they're met with an eerie silence. The air is thick with an otherworldly energy that crackles across their skin.

SARAH
(alarmed)
Jack, we need to get out of here! This energy signature is off the charts!

JACK
(hesitating)
Not yet. We have to see what's down there.

They approach a massive entrance, guarded by ancient stone statues with glowing blue eyes.

LUCAS
(whispering)
Legend has it that Darkstar Expedition discovered this place decades ago. But they never returned...

Suddenly, the air is filled with an electric charge, and the statues come to life. The team is caught in a barrage of lightning-fast attacks as the creatures defend their territory.

**Act III:**

As they fight for survival, we learn more about Jack's troubled past. He was once part of the original Darkstar Expedition, but something went horribly wrong on one of their missions...

JACK
( flashback )
I couldn't save her... I couldn't save them all...

Back in the present, Lucas is gravely injured as they're forced to retreat from the valley.

SARAH
(desperate)
We have to get him out of here!

JACK
(calmly)
Not yet. We need to understand what we just saw down there.

As they tend to Lucas's wounds, Sarah hacks into her comms device to gather more intel on their situation...

SARAH
(urgently)
Jack, I'm reading encrypted messages from an unknown source. They're asking about us... and our mission.

JACK
(grimly)
We've got a problem.

The episode ends with the team escaping the valley, but not without leaving behind a cryptic message on the entrance: "They're coming for you..."

We see Jason walking through the forest, his backpack loaded with gear. He's been hiking for hours and is clearly lost in thought. Suddenly, he hears a rustling in the bushes nearby. Out steps a woman, Emily (28), who looks like she's been living off the land.

EMILY
(roughly)
You're not from around here, are you?

JASON
(startled)
No...I'm just passing through.

Emily eyes him warily but doesn't seem hostile.

(skeptical)
What brings you out here? You look like you've got a lot on your mind.

(listening intently)
You're not a failure, Jason. You just...lost your way.

Jason looks up at her with tears in his eyes.

JASON
(emotionally)
I don't know if I can ever go back to the way things were before. It feels like everything is beyond redemption.

Emily nods knowingly, and for a moment, we see a glimmer of understanding between them.

**TO BE CONTINUED**<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Epic streaming series. The title of the series is `Eternal Realms`.<start>**Episode 1: "Awakening"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a breathtaking landscape of rolling hills, towering mountains, and shimmering waterfalls. The air is filled with an ethereal glow, as if the very fabric of reality is alive.

We see our protagonist, Eira, a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, standing at the edge of a serene lake. She's dressed in simple yet elegant attire, carrying a staff made from a living tree branch.

Eira takes a deep breath, feeling an ancient energy coursing through her veins. She closes her eyes, and when she opens them again, we see that they've changed – now a radiant shade of indigo that seems to shimmer with an otherworldly power.

Suddenly, visions begin to flood Eira's mind: memories from a lifetime ago, a past that's been hidden from her for reasons unknown. We see glimpses of battles fought and won, magic wielded with reckless abandon, and ancient civilizations rising and falling like the tides.

As Eira struggles to comprehend these revelations, we hear a voice whispering in her ear – an eerie melody that resonates deep within her soul.

**Act II:**

We're introduced to Lyrien, a brooding warrior with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair, who's been tracking Eira across the realms. He's driven by a single-minded purpose: to capture her for the sake of his master, the dark sorcerer Malakar.

Lyrien is joined by an unlikely ally – Zephyr, a mischievous thief with an uncanny ability to manipulate shadows and light. Together, they close in on Eira, intent on dragging her back to their dark lord's fortress.

Meanwhile, we meet Riven, a mysterious enchantress who claims to be Eira's long-lost mentor. She appears to be hiding secrets of her own, as Lyrien grows increasingly suspicious of her true intentions.

**Act III:**

Eira is ambushed by Lyrien and Zephyr, but instead of fighting back, she unleashes the ancient power coursing through her veins. A brilliant explosion of light erupts around her, sending both warriors stumbling backward in awe.

As Eira stands tall, her staff glowing with an intense energy, we see a vision of the Eternal Realms – a tapestry woven from countless worlds and civilizations that have come and gone across the ages.

The camera zooms out to reveal the true scope of this realm: a vast expanse of interconnected worlds, each teeming with magic and life. We glimpse the silhouettes of ancient beings, watching Eira's awakening with bated breath.

As the act ends, we see Lyrien and Zephyr exchange a look that says they're not sure what to make of Eira – or her destiny – but one thing is certain: the fate of the Eternal Realms hangs in the balance.

**Closing shot:**

The camera lingers on Eira's face, as she gazes up at the stars, a mix of wonder and trepidation etched across her features. The screen fades to black, leaving the audience with more questions than answers – but eager for the journey ahead.

Behind the bar stands JACK "BLACKJACK" McCORD (40s), a ruggedly handsome man with a black duster coat and a reputation for being one of the best horse thieves in the West.

BLACKJACK
(to the patrons)
You folks hear about the latest string of bank robberies? These outlaws are gettin' bolder by the day...

Suddenly, the swinging doors burst open and in walks ELIZABETH "LILY" REED (20s), a striking woman with piercing green eyes and a determined look on her face.

LILY
(to Blackjack)
I'm here about my sister. She was supposed to meet me in Shadow Valley three days ago, but she never showed up.

BLACKJACK
(skeptical)
What's your business with the Sheriff?

A group of outlaws emerges from the rocks, led by none other than JACK'S ARCH-NEMESIS: JESSE "THE GHOST" MARSHALL (30s).

MARSHALL
(sneering)
You think you can stop me? I've got the Sheriff right where I want him...

Blackjack readies his six-shooter as Lily takes cover behind a nearby boulder.
