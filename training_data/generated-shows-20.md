FADE IN:

EXT. LAST HOPE STATION - DAY

The camera pans over a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape before zooming in on the Last Hope Station, a sprawling complex of makeshift shelters and life support systems.

CUT TO:

INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY

We see JAX (28), a rugged and resourceful young man with short, dark hair and a determined look, standing at a console, speaking with his fellow survivors.

JAX
(serious)
Okay, we've got 24 hours of food, water, and air left. We need to come up with a plan to replenish our supplies or risk being trapped here forever.

MAYA (25), Jax's closest friend and confidant, steps forward.

MAYA
We can't leave the station without risking exposure to the outside environment. The toxins and radiation are too great.

JAX
( resolute)
That's exactly why we need to send out a team to scavenge for supplies. We'll take what we need and return before it gets dark.

CUT TO:

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

The Last Hope Station residents gather around a holographic display projected in front of them.

JAX
(to the group)
Alright, listen up! I'm assigning Maya, Arin (30), our chief engineer, and Dr. Zara (50), our resident scientist, to go out and scavenge for supplies. They'll be leaving at sundown.

ARIN
(skeptical)
You're sending them into a radiation zone? That's suicide!

DR. ZARA
( matter-of-factly )
Actually, I've run the numbers. If we can collect just 20 kilograms of food and water, it'll last us long enough to develop a more sustainable solution.

MAYA
(confident)
We got this.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAST HOPE STATION - DAY

As the sun begins to set, Maya, Arin, and Dr. Zara suit up in makeshift protective gear and prepare to depart. Jax hands Maya a small, encrypted comms device.

JAX
(firmly)
If anything goes wrong, use this to call for help.

MAYA
(grim determination)
We'll be fine.

CUT TO:

EXT. RADIATION ZONE - DAY

The three survivors venture into the radiation zone, navigating through a desolate wasteland of twisted metal and rubble. They stumble upon an abandoned vehicle, half-buried in debris.

ARIN
(excitedly)
Guys, look at this!

DR. ZARA
(intrigued)
It's a generator. We could use it to power our life support systems.

MAYA
( cautious )
Let's be careful. We don't know what kind of radiation is coming from that thing.

As they approach the vehicle, strange readings appear on their suit's hazard monitors.

ARIN
(nervously)
Jax warned us about this. Let's get out of here!

DR. ZARA
(investigative)
No, we need to understand what's happening. This reading...

Suddenly, a blinding flash illuminates the area. Maya stumbles back, her suit malfunctioning.

CUT TO:

INT. LAST HOPE STATION - DAY

Back at the station, Jax and the others anxiously await news from the scavenging team. Hours tick by with no word. As night begins to fall, Jax's comms device crackles to life.

JAX
(relieved)
Maya? Arin? Zara?

There is only silence on the other end of the line...

CUT TO:

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Kaelin Darkshadow, THE LAST DRAGONLORD (30s), sits on a throne, surrounded by his advisors and guards. He's a powerful warrior with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair.

KAELIN
(to his advisors)
We must discuss the recent attacks on our borders. The orcs have grown bolder since their leader, Gorthok, declared war on us.

ADVISOR 1
Sir, we believe it's not just the orcs. We've had reports of a dark sorcerer who's been secretly gathering an army in the shadows.

KAELIN
(skeptical)
A sorcerer? I'm not concerned about rumors and superstitions. Our greatest enemy is still the orcs.

ADVISOR 2
But, sir, what if it's more than just coincidence? What if this sorcerer is working with Gorthok?

Kaelin looks at his advisors, then out the window, where a massive dragon is perched on the castle walls. The beast's eyes seem to be watching Kaelin.

KAELIN
(to his advisors)
Very well. Investigate these claims and bring me proof of this sorcerer's existence.

CUT TO:

EXT. DRAGON'S SPINE - DAY

A young woman, LYRA (20s), runs through the mountains, pursued by orcs. She leaps onto a cliffside and finds herself face-to-face with a massive dragon. The beast looks at her, then back to the oncoming orcs.

LYRA
(desperate)
Help me!

The dragon breathes fire, incinerating the orcs below. Lyra's eyes widen in awe as she realizes this dragon is different from any she's ever seen before.

CUT TO:

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Kaelin sits on his throne, staring at a large map of their kingdom. His advisors enter, carrying a small, ornate box.

ADVISOR 1
Sir, we've found the sorcerer.

KAELIN
(serious)
Where?

ADVISOR 2
In an ancient ruin deep within the Dragon's Spine.

Kaelin nods, then looks at his dragon perched on the castle walls. The beast seems to be watching him, its eyes burning with a fierce intensity.

CUT TO:

EXT. ANCIENT RUIN - DAY

Lyra stands outside the ancient ruin, looking up at the entrance in awe. She takes a deep breath and enters, sword drawn.

INT. ANCIENT RUIN - DAY

Kaelin steps out of the shadows, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of danger. Lyra looks around, her hand on the hilt of her sword.

LYRA
(smirking)
You're not who I thought you'd be.

KAELIN
(smirking back)
And you are...?

Lyra hesitates before answering.

LYRA
(a bit sheepishly)
I'm just a young woman trying to survive in a world that's full of monsters and magic.

Kaelin nods, his eyes never leaving hers. He reaches out with his hand and touches the box held by his advisor.

KAELIN
(serious)
This is it. The final battle against Gorthok begins today.

CUT TO:

EXT. DRAGON'S SPINE - DAY

The orcs march towards the ancient ruin, their banners waving in the wind. Lyra stands tall, her sword at the ready. Kaelin looks out at the oncoming army, his eyes burning with determination.

We see a typical Tokyo street, with people walking in all directions. We zoom in on one particular corner, where a small alleyway meets the main street.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFE - DAY

We're inside a cozy little cafe, tucked away in that alleyway. The walls are lined with bookshelves, and the air is thick with the smell of freshly brewed coffee. We see our protagonist, YUI (28), sitting at a small table by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee.

YUI
(to herself)
What am I doing today?

She looks at her phone, which displays a calendar full of mundane tasks: grocery shopping, laundry, and a dentist appointment.

CUT TO:

INT. YUI'S APARTMENT - DAY

We see Yui's apartment, which is cluttered with books, papers, and half-finished craft projects. She walks over to the kitchen counter and picks up a small notebook.

YUI (V.O.)
I've been putting off calling my mom for weeks now. I'm not sure what to say.

She flips through the pages of her notebook, which are filled with doodles and snippets of poetry. We see that she's been keeping a habit journal, where she writes down small accomplishments every day: "did laundry" or "went for a walk".

CUT TO:

INT. YUI'S WORKPLACE - DAY

Yui works as an assistant editor at a publishing house. She sits at her desk, staring blankly at her computer screen.

YUI
(to coworker, RINA)
I'm just so burnt out lately. I feel like I'm doing the same thing every day.

RINA
You're not alone, Yui-chan. We all feel that way sometimes.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFE - LATER

Yui returns to the cafe, this time with a friend, TAKA (29). They sit down at a small table and start discussing their plans for the future.

TAKA
So, what's next for you?

I don't know. I feel like I'm just drifting through life right now.

Taka nods in understanding.

The sun beats down on the dusty town, population 200. We see townsfolk going about their daily business: a blacksmith hammering away at an anvil, a seamstress sewing by the window of her shop.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

We see our hero, JACK MCQUEEN (30s), sitting at a table with his back to us. He's dressed in worn leather and denim, a wanted poster on the wall behind him with his name written in bold letters. Jack is sipping whiskey, looking out the window.

Suddenly, the swinging doors of the saloon burst open and in walks our anti-hero, HENRY "THE DEVIL" DURANT (40s), dressed to the nines in a black duster coat and wide-brimmed hat. He's got a reputation for being the meanest, most ruthless man in the West.

DURANT
(to the patrons)
Evenin', folks. Looks like I've arrived just in time for the party.

The townsfolk look on with a mix of fear and fascination as Durant takes a seat at the bar, ordering a drink from the bartender.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN - DAY

We see Jack leaving the saloon, walking down the main street, keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble. He spots Durant talking to the local sheriff, who looks like he's cowed by the notorious outlaw.

JACK
(to the sheriff)
What's going on here?

SHERIFF
(nervously)
Just discussin' some... business with Mr. Durant. You know how it is, Jack.

JACK
(hesitant)
I reckon I don't want to know.

Jack turns and walks away, but not before he catches a glimpse of something that makes his blood run cold: Durant's men, armed to the teeth, are gathering on the outskirts of town.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - LATER

Durant is now at Jack's table, ordering him out of the way so he can take his seat.

DURANT
(to Jack)
You're lookin' a mite too comfortable for my taste, McQueen. Why don't you just get on outta here?

JACK
(calmly)
I reckon I'll stay right where I am.

Durant smiles, showing sharp teeth, and pulls out a gun from beneath his coat.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN - LATER

A showdown is brewing. Durant's men are surrounding the saloon, while Jack stands tall outside, ready to face whatever comes next.

The camera zooms in on Jack's face as he says...

JASON
(serious)
It's them, Sarah. The Shadow Syndicate has escalated their attacks.

GUARD 1
Sir, we have visual confirmation of a heavily armored robot tearing through downtown.

Jason and Sarah fight their way through the robot army, taking down enemies left and right.

INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

We enter the bookshop, where we find owner TAKAHASHI (70s) busily arranging books on a shelf. He's surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes and papers piled high on his desk. A faint scent of old paper wafts through the air.

Takashi carefully places a book on a shelf, running his fingers over its spine.

TAKAHASHI
(to himself)
 Ah, this one... I remember now. This is a first edition of Tanizaki's "The Makioka Sisters". Rare, you know.

Suddenly, the doorbell above the entrance rings out. A young woman, EMILY (20s), enters the shop. She looks around in awe at the crowded shelves and Takashi's worn desk.

EMILY
Hi! I'm so sorry to interrupt...

TAKAHASHI
 Ah, welcome to my humble abode! What brings you here today?

EMILY
( browsing through shelves )
 Oh, just looking for something... anything. Really. My grandmother used to love reading these kinds of books.

 Ah? You're interested in classic Japanese literature?

Emily nods, and Takashi begins to recommend books.

Emily listens intently as Takashi finishes his story. We see a sense of connection between the two, bridged by their shared love of literature.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED TEMPLE - NIGHT

A lone figure, LYRA (25), awakens from a deep slumber, groggily sitting up in a makeshift bed of leaves and animal hides. She's dressed in tattered leather armor, adorned with small, intricate carvings that seem to match the strange energy emanating from the forest.

Lyra looks around, taking in her surroundings. The temple appears abandoned for centuries - crumbling stonework, vines crawling over cracked stone walls, and a faint scent of decay wafting through the air.

LYRA (V.O)
I don't remember how I got here... or why. All I know is that my memories are shrouded in darkness.

As she rises to her feet, Lyra notices an ancient text etched into the wall - a symbol that seems to pulse with a faint, blue light.

LYRA (CONT'D)
This must be the reason I'm here. To uncover the secrets of Tharros.

CUT TO:

EXT. THARRON WILDS - DAY

Lyra exits the temple, stepping into the mist-shrouded forest. She's met with an eerie silence, as if the very trees are watching her every move. Suddenly, a faint rustling echoes through the underbrush.

A figure emerges from the shadows: Kael (28), a ruggedly handsome warrior with piercing green eyes and broad shoulders. He approaches Lyra cautiously, hand on the hilt of his sword.

KAEL
You're... you're not supposed to be here.

LYRA
(uneasy)
Who are you? And what do you mean?

Kael hesitates, glancing around nervously.

KAEL (CONT'D)
Tharros is a place where memories go to die. People who come here... they forget. Everything.

Lyra's eyes narrow, her grip on the dagger at her belt tightening.

LYRA
(skeptical)
That can't be true.

Kael shrugs, his expression unreadable.

KAEL (CONT'D)
Ask me anything about Tharros. I'll tell you nothing.

The camera lingers on Lyra's puzzled expression as she weighs Kael's words. Suddenly, the air seems to charged with an electric tension - a storm brewing in the distance.

As Lyra and Kael continue to navigate the treacherous landscape, strange, dreamlike visions begin to haunt them: whispers of forgotten battles, ghostly apparitions, and echoes of long-forgotten lore.

The camera spins around them in dizzying arcs, reflecting their disorienting experiences. The sound design intensifies, as if the very fabric of reality is unraveling.

CUT TO:

EXT. THARRON WILDS - DAY

Lyra stops Kael, her hand on his arm.

LYRA
(grimly)
Tell me more about Tharros. And what happened to its people.

Kael's expression remains guarded, but a hint of curiosity flickers in his eyes.

KAEL (CONT'D)
The people of Tharros... they were erased. Their memories, their cultures... everything. This land is a graveyard for the forgotten.

Lyra's face sets in determination.

LYRA
(firmly)
Then it's my job to uncover what happened here. And restore the memories that have been lost.

Kael nods, a hint of approval creeping into his expression.

KAEL (CONT'D)
I'll help you. Together, we can unravel the mysteries of Tharros.

As Jason interviews the townsfolk, we see a series of flashbacks revealing Blackheart Bill's troubled past: an orphaned child who grew up on the streets, surviving by any means necessary. His early life as a Union cavalry scout, where he honed his survival skills and learned to use his cunning. And finally, his transformation into the notorious outlaw known throughout the West.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - NIGHT

As the sun sets over Red Rock Town, Jason gathers with Jack and the other townsfolk to share what they've learned about Blackheart Bill's past. The woman from the stagecoach robbery joins them, sharing her own story of loss and survival.

JASON
(serious)
You all know that Blackheart Bill is not just a thug - he's a product of our society. A man who was driven to desperation by circumstance. But we can't let that excuse what he's done. We need to bring him to justice, for the sake of Red Rock Town and its people.

The camera zooms out as Jason stands tall, his expression unwavering in the face of danger.

BLACKHEART BILL

CATHERINE
Elizabeth, I'm glad you're back. I've been worried sick about you.

ELIZABETH
I know, Mother. But I had to come home. The news from London is getting worse by the day.

Catherine nods gravely as Elizabeth approaches her.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
Yes...the war with Napoleon continues to drag on. And it seems the British government is struggling to find a way out of this mess.

ELIZABETH
That's an understatement, Mother. The latest dispatches from Wellington's army in Portugal are dire. I fear for our safety here at Winterbourne.

CATHERINE
(skeptical)
Oh, come now, Elizabeth. You're not going to let some news reports scare you into hiding, are you?

ELIZABETH
(firmly)
No, Mother. This is serious business. And I'm not just thinking of us; I'm thinking of the people who work on our land, the servants...the entire community relies on us for protection.

Catherine looks taken aback by Elizabeth's conviction.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
I see what you mean. Alright, let's get the garrison into position and make sure everyone is prepared in case things take a turn for the worse.

Elizabeth nods as Catherine gives her a stern look.

ELIZABETH
(smiling wryly)
You know, Mother, sometimes I think your stubbornness is admirable...and sometimes it's just downright infuriating.

Catherine chuckles despite herself, and Elizabeth takes advantage of the momentary lull to slip away unnoticed.

Elizabeth sits by a window, pouring over a stack of letters and dispatches from the front lines. She looks up as her brother, ARTHUR (25), enters the room.

ARTHUR
Hey, Lizzie...just thought I'd join you in some... intellectual pursuits.

ELIZABETH
(smirking)
Oh, Arthur, how delightful to have your company.

Arthur ambles over to where Elizabeth sits, looking out at her with a mixture of admiration and envy.

ARTHUR (CONT'D)
You know, sometimes I wish I had half the courage you do.

Elizabeth raises an eyebrow as Arthur settles in beside her.

ELIZABETH

Courage is just a word, Arthur. It's what we do when things get tough that really matters.

Arthur nods solemnly, and Elizabeth turns back to her papers, the tension between them palpable.

JACK

Alright, I think we've made enough enemies for one day. Time to get out of here before things get ugly.

SARAH
(firmly)
You're not leaving without me, Jack McCoy. We've got a price on our heads now. We need to stay together if we want to survive.

Jack nods, and they take a seat at the bar, ordering whiskey from the bartender, JASON.

JASON
(eyeing them warily)
Word is, you two are in deep with the lawmen of Red Rock. They'll stop at nothing to capture you both.

Jack and Sarah are in a heated discussion with JASON, who's trying to convince them to leave town.

We can't just run, Jack. We have to stand up for ourselves.

JACK

I'm with you, Sarah. But we need a plan, and fast.

Well, well, well... Looks like we've got ourselves some fugitives.

Alright everyone, gather 'round. I've got some news to share.

His associates look at him with concern.

MARCUS (CONT'D)
It's come to my attention that our firm has been...inundated with a number of high-profile cases lately. And by inundated, I mean we're swimming in them.

The room fills with murmurs and nods of agreement.

TANYA JENKINS (20s, sharp jawline), the youngest member of the team, speaks up.

TANYA
Marcus, shouldn't we be taking on more cases? We have a reputation to uphold.

The camera follows Calder as she walks towards the center of the valley, where a gathering of figures awaits. They're cloaked in hooded robes, their faces obscured by shadows.

LETHAR (30s), one of the robed figures, steps forward. His voice is low and mysterious.

LETHAR
Calder, you've been chosen.

CALDER

Chosen? What for?

LETHAR

The camera cuts back to Calder, now surrounded by a dozen robed figures.

LETHAR

You've been trained for this moment, Calder. But it's not just about you; the fate of Arkon depends on your choices.

As Lethar finishes speaking, a massive explosion shakes the ground beneath their feet. The earth splits open, revealing a hidden tunnel leading deep into the heart of the mountains.

Alright, here's the situation: we've got a high-profile murder. The victim is wealthy businessman Richard Langley, found dead in his mansion by his wife, Sarah.

AGNES

What's the motive?

CAPTAIN
Appears to be robbery gone wrong... or so it seems. The thing is, the killer left no DNA evidence behind, and there are no witnesses.

Yeah, yeah. Just getting used to the new job and the new town.

GUS

You think this is just another job? You've been here three weeks and you still look like you're lost in thought most of the time.

Jess tries to brush it off but we can see the pain etched on her face. We cut to a series of flashbacks, revealing Jess's complicated past: the loss of her younger brother at sea, the subsequent guilt and anger that drove her away from home, and the struggle to come to terms with what happened.

Lyra is deep in meditation, trying to connect with the mystical energies that reside within Aethoria.

Suddenly, she feels an energy surge through her body. Her eyes snap open, and she gasps as visions begin to flash before her mind's eye:

* Images of a massive space battle between two armies
* Visions of Lyra herself wielding incredible powers
* Scenes of the Starfire Prophecy, a ancient legend that speaks of the chosen one who will bring balance to the universe

Lyra gets up from her knees, looking stunned and disoriented. She approaches an elderly woman, Arkea (60s), who's watching her with wise eyes.

ARKEA:

It begins. The Prophecy unfolds as foretold.

LYRA:

Lyra returns home, exhausted and overwhelmed by the events at the temple. Her friends and family try to make sense of her experiences, but she's struggling to understand what's happening herself.

As Lyra reflects on the visions and her newfound connection to the ancient prophecies, we see flashbacks of her childhood:

* Memories of her parents, who vanished when Lyra was just a teenager
* Images of an ancient tome that holds secrets about her true nature

These glimpses into Lyra's past reveal a sense of loss and abandonment. Her journey ahead will be shaped by the truth she uncovers.

Lyra is unsure about Xander's intentions but finds herself drawn to him. As tensions rise between the rival factions outside, Lyra must make a choice: trust Arkea and her teachings or follow the mysterious allure of Xander.

LUCAS
(to Jessie)
Jessie! I thought you were supposed to be on vacation. What brings you back here tonight?

JESSIE
(nervously)
Just making sure everything is secure for the storm. You know how it gets around here...

LUCAS
(skeptically)
You're not alone in this, are you? There's something going on that I'm not aware of.

Jessie hesitates, unsure if she should confide in Lucas.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason enters his small apartment, exhausted. He collapses onto the couch, dropping his bag on the floor. His eyes scan the room, taking in the familiar surroundings. We see a series of old newspaper clippings taped to the fridge: "Local Fisherman Still Missing", "Search Continues for Lost Sailor". Jason's gaze lingers on these reminders of his past.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jason makes himself a cup of coffee, staring out the window as he waits for it to brew. His phone rings, shrill in the silence. He hesitates before answering.

JASON
(into phone)
Yeah?

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)
Jason? It's been years... I know you're alive. We need to talk.

CUT TO:

EXT. COASTAL TOWN - DAY

The camera follows Jason as he walks through the small coastal town, passing by the bustling docks and quaint shops. He stops at a diner, where we see an old friend, SARAH (30s), waiting for him. Sarah is a bit worn down, but still has that spark in her eyes.

SARAH
(overjoyed)
Jason! Oh my god... it's been so long!

JASON
(forced smile)
Hey, Sarah. It's good to see you too.

As they hug, the camera captures the awkwardness between them. We sense a history here, but one that has been left unresolved.

CUT TO:

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Jason and Sarah visit Sheriff Tom (50s), an old acquaintance of Jason's. The sheriff looks concerned as he shares some news: there have been reports of strange occurrences in the town - missing fishermen, ghost ships on the horizon, unexplained storms.

SHERIFF TOM
You've come back just in time for this mess, Jason. We need your help figuring out what's going on.

JASON
(skeptical)
Me? What makes you think I'm qualified for anything?

Sheriff Tom hands Jason a folder with some disturbing photographs.

SHERIFF TOM (CONT'D)
Because we know about your... history with the ocean. You've got skills that could be useful in this situation.

As the sheriff speaks, the camera lingers on Jason's face. We see a flicker of recognition - something has stirred within him, and he knows his life is about to change forever.

We see a sprawling metropolis floating among the clouds, its towering skyscrapers and zipping airships a marvel of modern engineering.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. ELARA VEX'S LABORATORY - DAY

Dr. Elara Vex, a brilliant scientist in her mid-40s with short, dark hair and piercing green eyes, stands before a holographic display projecting the Aetherspace City's infrastructure. She addresses her research team, consisting of Dr. Liam Chen, an engineer in his late 20s, and Dr. Maya Singh, a young physicist.

ELARA
(serious tone)
We've reached a critical juncture. The anomaly we've detected within the Aetherspace is growing exponentially. We can no longer ignore it.

LIAM
(nervously)
What are its implications, Elara?

ELARA
(hesitates)
Theoretically... it could be a gateway to another dimension.

MAYA
(excitedly)
That's impossible! The laws of physics—

ELARA
(firmly)
We'll know more once we're inside. Liam, can you—

LIAM
(interrupting)
I'm on it.

CUT TO:

EXT. AETHERSPACE CITY - DAY

Liam Chen steps into a sleek, silver airship perched atop the city's central hub. The vessel lifts off, ascending into the clouds as it approaches the anomaly.

INT. AIRSHIP - DAY

Liam navigates through the ship's control room, joined by Elara and Maya via holographic projections. They watch as the anomaly takes shape before them – a swirling vortex of iridescent colors that seem to defy the laws of physics.

MAYA
(awed)
It's beautiful...

ELARA
(determined)
We're not here for aesthetics. Liam, can you stabilize our position?

LIAM
(focused)
Working on it...

The ship shudders violently as a massive energy surge emanates from the anomaly. The team is buffeted by turbulence.

CUT TO:

INT. DR. VEX'S LABORATORY - DAY (LATER)

As the airship stabilizes, Elara and her team analyze data streaming in from Liam's expedition. Maya points to an alarming fluctuation on one of the screens.

MAYA
(concerned)
Elara, this reading indicates—

ELARA
(calmly)
We've been warned.

Suddenly, a ghostly figure begins to coalesce within the holographic display projected by Elara's computer. The team exchanges nervous glances as they realize that Liam has breached the anomaly...

I'm telling you, Jess, I saw the most adorable puppy on my way here this morning.

JESS
(smiling)
Aww, that sounds like the perfect start to the day. What kind of breed was it?

SARAH
(hesitating for a moment)
Uh...I don't know if I should say...

Jess raises an eyebrow, curious.

JESS
(teasingly)
Come on, Sarah! Spill!

Sarah leans in, looking around nervously before speaking in hushed tones.

SARAH
(whispering)
It was a golden retriever. But it looked...different. Like, it had these weird markings on its ears...

Sarah, what are you trying to tell me?

We're inside Jess's small house, where her grandmother, LUCY (65), is baking cookies in the kitchen. Lucy looks up as Jess enters the room.

LUCY
(smiling)
Hey, kiddo! I'm almost done with these chocolate chip cookies...

JESS
(concerned)
Grandma, can we talk?

Lucy puts down her mixing spoon and turns to face Jess.

LUCY
(curious)
What's going on?

Jess takes a deep breath before speaking.

JESS
(hesitant)
Sarah told me she saw a golden retriever with weird markings on its ears...

Lucy's expression turns serious, and she nods slowly.

LUCY
(reminiscing)
Ah...you must be thinking of Rocky...
