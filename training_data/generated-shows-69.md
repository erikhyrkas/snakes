Detective JESSICA MARTIN (30s), a tough, no-nonsense woman with short brown hair and piercing green eyes, steps out of an elevator and into the bustling hallway of the police station. She's accompanied by her partner, Detective MIKE TAYLOR (40s), a grizzled old-school cop with a bushy mustache.

JESSICA
(serious)
Mike, we need to talk to Emily Wilson.

MIKE
(skeptical)
What's this about? You said she was just a missing person case?

JESSICA
(hesitates)
That's what I thought. But then I got a call from her sister. She claims Emily had been in contact with her...just last night.

MIKE
(intrigued)
Go on.

CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica and Mike sit across from EMILY WILSON (20s), a timid, nervous young woman who looks like she's been through hell.

I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't talked to anyone in...in weeks.

JESSICA
(persistent)
Emily, your sister says you were in contact with someone just last night. Who was it?

EMILY
(nervously)
I...I was just online. I didn't do anything wrong.

MIKE
(skeptical)
Online? What did you say to them?

EMILY
(whispers)
Nothing. Just...nothing.

Jessica exchanges a knowing glance with Mike, sensing that Emily is hiding something.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Back at the police station, Jessica and Mike are discussing the case in hushed tones.

JESSICA
(serious)
I think we're dealing with more than just a missing person here, Mike. I think we have a possible homicide on our hands.

MIKE
(skeptical)
What makes you say that?

JESSICA
(persistent)
The way Emily was acting back there...she knew something. And the sister's call...there's something she's not telling us either.

Suddenly, a computer screen behind them flickers to life, showing an email exchange between two unknown individuals.

Oh my...

Write a script for the single episode of a Historical Fiction streaming series. The title of the series is `Forgotten Kingdoms`.<start>**Episode 1: "The Last Queen of Khotan"**

**Act I:**

(Opening shot of the Karakoram Mountains, with snow-capped peaks and a small oasis town in the distance)

Narrator (Voiceover): In the late 13th century, amidst the chaos of the Mongol Conquests, one kingdom stood as a beacon of resistance. Khotan, a fabled city nestled in the heart of the Karakoram Mountains, held out against Genghis Khan's armies. Its last queen, Princess Narakoti, was determined to preserve her people's traditions and culture.

(Scene: The palace throne room, where Queen Narakoti sits on her throne, surrounded by advisors and guards)

Queen Narakoti (to her advisors): We cannot let the Mongols breach our walls again! Their armies have already swept through Samarkand and Bukhara. It's only a matter of time before they come for us.

Adviser 1: Your Majesty, we've had reports that Genghis Khan himself is leading this campaign against Khotan. We must prepare to defend ourselves at all costs.

Queen Narakoti (firmly): I will not flee or surrender. My people have lived in these mountains for centuries. This land is our lifeblood.

Adviser 2: If we fight and lose, what then? The Mongols will enslave us, destroy our culture...

Queen Narakoti (cuts him off): Silence! We will not be intimidated by threats of enslavement or annihilation. I've instructed the military to prepare for battle. We'll hold out as long as possible.

(Scene: The town's military commander, General Khandu, riding with his cavalry through the valleys and canyons outside Khotan)

General Khandu (to his officers): Our scouts report that the Mongol army is approaching from multiple directions. We must use our terrain to our advantage – this land will be their graveyard.

(Scene: Genghis Khan's army, led by Subutai, arrives at the outskirts of Khotan)

Subutai: This city will fall within a fortnight. I've seen no sign of resistance.

Genghis Khan (appears): Not yet. We'll show them our Mongol fury!

**Act II:**

(Scene: Queen Narakoti receives intelligence from her scouts, including news that the Mongols have surrounded Khotan)

Queen Narakoti: Our walls can't hold out against their siege engines and catapults for long.

Adviser 1: Your Majesty, we've a proposal – if we surrender now, perhaps they'll grant us mercy...

Queen Narakoti (coldly): You think I'd consider it? My people will fight to the death!

(Scene: Inside Khotan, the palace guards and townsfolk gather for an emergency council)

General Khandu: We can hold out a little longer. The Mongols are divided – their forces won't coordinate quickly.

Queen Narakoti (firmly): Prepare the civilians to evacuate, but we'll stay here, fight from within...

(Scene: Tensions rise as fighting erupts in the streets of Khotan)

(Scene: Queen Narakoti is seen directing her troops amidst chaos and flames; she orders General Khandu to make one final stand against Subutai's cavalry)

**Act III:**

(Scene: The last confrontation between General Khandu's forces and Subutai's Mongol horde)

General Khandu (to his men): We'll take them down, for the honor of Khotan!

Subutai: This is their final stand. Let us show no mercy.

(Scene: A fierce battle rages through the streets; General Khandu leads the charge against Subutai's troops)

(Scene: As the last defenders fall, Queen Narakoti stands alone in the palace throne room, defeated but proud)

Queen Narakoti (whispers to herself): My people... my land...

(Closing shot of Khotan burning, with Mongol riders entering the city; a final glance at the queen standing amidst the ashes)

Narrator (Voiceover): The Last Queen of Khotan would go on to become a legend in her own time – an icon of resistance against overwhelming odds. Her defiance and strength inspired generations to follow...<end>

Ugh, I'm so tired today. I think I'm still running on last night's Red Bull.

Well, you can't have too much Red Bull, right?

Mike chuckles and pours himself a cup of coffee. Jen hands him a plate with scrambled eggs and toast.

Jessica steps out of her car and into the opulent foyer of the estate. She's greeted by our host, LUCY GREENLEAF (30s), a poised and elegant woman with a hint of desperation in her eyes.

LUCY
(nervously)
Detective Taylor, thank you for coming so quickly. We've been searching everywhere for Emily.

JESSICA
(investigative tone)
What's going on? Where is Emily?

LUCY
(hesitating)
Emily... she was supposed to attend the charity gala tonight with us. But when I went to wake her up for breakfast, she was gone.

Jessica raises an eyebrow and begins to survey the area. She notices a piece of paper on the coffee table.

JESSICA
(reading from the note)
"Meet me at the old oak tree at 9 AM. Come alone." What do you know about this?

LUCY
(shaking her head)
Nothing, detective. I have no idea who would write such a thing or what it means.

Jessica turns to Lucy's father, THOMAS GREENLEAF (60s), a portly and imposing figure with a hint of condescension in his voice.

JESSICA
(to Thomas)
Mr. Greenleaf, where were you last night?

Suddenly, we hear footsteps outside Emily's room. It's JASON TAYLOR (40s), Jessica's estranged brother and a former cop himself.

Ah-ah, Jack. I've been expecting you...

CUT TO:

INT. FACILITY - LABORATORY - DAY

We meet our protagonist, Dr. Sophia Patel (30s), a brilliant and resourceful astrophysicist, frantically working alongside her team in a makeshift laboratory. They are surrounded by equipment, data screens, and a seemingly endless array of calculations.

SOPHIA
(urgently)
Alright, guys! We need to get this data online ASAP. We can't afford to lose another minute!

Her colleague, JASON (30s), a skilled engineer, works alongside her.

JASON
(nervously)
Sophia, are you sure we're doing the right thing here? This experiment has some... questionable ethics attached to it.

SOPHIA
(firmly)
We've discussed this, Jason. The stakes are too high. We have to push the boundaries of our understanding. Even if it means taking risks...

Suddenly, the data screens flicker and display an anomalous energy signature.

JASON
(alarmed)
What is that?!

SOPHIA
(intrigued)
It's... a resonance frequency. One we never thought possible. If this is what I think it is—

The team exchanges worried glances as Sophia's eyes widen with excitement.

CUT TO:

INT. FACILITY - OBSERVATORY - DAY

As the team continues to analyze the data, they notice an unusual phenomenon outside: a rift in space-time has opened above the facility, emitting an otherworldly energy.

SOPHIA
(whispering)
It's happening. We've created a stable wormhole.

The team watches in awe as objects and people from various parallel universes begin to emerge through the rift.

A figure, eerily identical to Sophia, appears at the edge of the rift. She's dressed in a suit that seems to be made of an otherworldly material.

PARALLEL SOPHIA

Hello, Sophia. We've been waiting for you.

Sophia's eyes widen as she processes this revelation.

SOPHIA
(stunned)
How... how did you get here?

PARALLEL SOPHIA
(mysteriously)
You'll see soon enough. Your world is about to change forever.

As the rift continues to pulse with energy, the camera zooms out to reveal a sprawling multiverse, full of infinite possibilities and dangers.

BLACKJACK

It was nothing.

Sarah steps forward, a hint of a smile on her face.

SARAH
(smiling)
I think there's more to this than just taking down outlaws, Blackjack. I think you're running from something...or someone.

Blackjack looks away, his expression unreadable.

**JIM (played by Andy Samberg)**, a lovable but slightly dim-witted sales associate, is working at the counter when his coworker, **LUCY (played by Aya Cash)**, bursts in.

LUCY
(exasperated)
Jim, have you seen the copier? It's on fire!

JIM
(calmly)
Ah, that's just its way of telling us it's tired. I'll just unplug it and let it take a nap.

LUCY
(sarcastically)
Yeah, because that's exactly what we need. A copier with heat exhaustion.

As Jim tries to fix the copier, **TOM (played by Bobby Moynihan)**, the store's eccentric manager, walks in.

TOM
(excitedly)
Everyone! Gather 'round! We're going to have a meeting about the Great Copier War of 2023!

The employees stare at each other, confused.

JIM
(sheepishly)
Uh, I think you mean the copier jammed again?

TOM
(no)
No, no, no! This is different. The copier has declared war on us.

LUCY
(drolly)
And we're just going to roll over and let it win?

TOM
(fervently)
That's exactly what I'm saying! We must surrender our snacks and surrender ourselves to the mercy of the copier!

As Tom continues his bizarre monologue, **SARAH (played by Lauren Lapkus)**, a straight-laced employee, tries to intervene.

SARAH
(logically)
Um, guys? I think we should just call the repair guy?

No way! We're going to fight back with... (dramatically) ...a new stapler!

Forgive me, my lady. I didn't mean to startle you.

LADY ISABELLA

Who are you? How did you get in here?

ALEXANDER
(reciting from memory)
"When the kingdoms are torn apart by strife and bloodshed, a young heir shall arise to claim the throne. One who has been hidden in plain sight, with secrets untold."

EMILY (V.O.)
I've always been drawn to the past. The way memories can transport us back to moments we thought were lost forever.

(Emily browses through a collection of old photographs and letters, her fingers tracing the creases on worn pages.)

EMILY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My grandmother was a memory keeper. She'd collect stories from our family's history, preserving them in small notebooks she'd fill with anecdotes and photos.

(Cut to Emily's childhood, where we see her sitting by her grandmother's bedside as an old woman shares tales of the past.)

GRANDMOTHER
This is my favorite story about your great-grandmother. She was a singer, you know? Her voice could charm the birds from the trees...

EMILY (V.O.)
Grandma used to say that memories were like threads in a tapestry – if we didn't tend to them, they'd unravel and disappear forever.

**Act II:**

(As Emily grows older, her grandmother passes away, leaving behind a collection of notebooks and an old key.)

EMILY (V.O.)
I found this key among Grandma's belongings. It opened a small, dusty trunk in the attic...

(The camera follows Emily as she opens the trunk, revealing a set of antique music boxes and a journal belonging to her great-grandmother.)

EMILY
(Voice trembling)
These are my great-grandmother's stories... She wrote about love, loss, and secrets. Secrets that I never knew existed.

(Cut to a series of fragmented flashbacks: Emily sees glimpses of her great-grandmother's life – a young woman in love, facing heartbreak, and making choices she'd later regret.)

EMILY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The more I read these stories, the more I realized that memories aren't just threads – they're also weights. We carry them with us, sometimes unaware of their impact on our lives.

**Act III:**

(As Emily delves deeper into her family's history, she begins to unravel the tangled threads of love and betrayal.)

EMILY
(Voice barely above a whisper)
I discovered that my great-grandmother had made a choice – one that changed the course of our family's future. A choice that still echoes through generations...

(The camera zooms out as Emily looks at her reflection in a small mirror, the faces of her ancestors swirling around her.)

EMILY (V.O.)
Memories have a way of fracturing us, don't they? One broken thread can lead to an entire tapestry unraveling.

Lucy enters her cluttered apartment, filled with half-finished art projects and dusty trinkets from her travels. She drops onto the couch, looking exhausted. Her phone rings; it's her best friend, Emily.

Hey, girl! How was your drive back?

LUCY

Long. And hot.

EMILY
Sorry about that. You okay? You sound off.

You need to talk to someone, not me, obviously (laughs).

Lucy meets up with her estranged mother, CAROL (50s), at a cozy coffee shop in town. Carol is elegant, but guarded, as she orders their drinks.

So, you're back to stay?

For now. I'll be selling some art pieces and clearing out my old apartment before deciding on the next move.

Carol pushes Lucy's art portfolio across the table.

Lucy's face softens as she begins to open up about her emotions, but stops short of sharing the real reason for her return: her longing for Jason.

Jenny arrives at the designated location, finding it abandoned except for an older man, EDWARD (55). He's grizzled and worn out.

EDWARD
Jenny...thank God you're here.

JENNY
(confused)
What do you mean? What's going on?

EDWARD
(serious)
Eclipse protocol was compromised. Someone has infiltrated the highest levels of our organization. I'm talking national security breach, Jenny.

CUT TO:

INT. NSA HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

We see RYAN (32), a smooth-talking and ambitious NSA agent, sneaking around the facility. He's on his phone with an unknown ally.

RYAN
(to himself)
This is too easy...

Suddenly, Ryan's partner, SARAH (30), bursts into the room.

SARAH
Ryan...what are you doing?

RYAN
(nervously)
Nothing, Sarah...just checking some leads.

SARAH
(skeptical)
Save it. I know what's going on.

CUT TO:

INT. SAFEHOUSE - MIDNIGHT

Jenny is stunned by Edward's revelation.

JENNY
(alarmed)
How? Who could have compromised Eclipse protocol?

EDWARD
(grimly)
I don't know yet, but we need to get out of here. Now.

Suddenly, the safehouse is breached, and two heavily armed agents burst in.

CUT TO:

EXT. NSA HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Ryan's partner, Sarah, confronts him outside the facility.

SARAH
(anger rising)
You're not who I thought you were, Ryan. You're the one who compromised Eclipse protocol!

RYAN
(defiantly)
I'm just doing my job, Sarah...trying to keep this country safe.

CUT TO:

INT. SAFEHOUSE - MIDNIGHT

Jenny and Edward escape through a hidden exit, pursued by the agents.

CUT TO:

EXT. NSA HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Sarah is left standing alone in front of the facility, looking directly at Ryan, who's watching her from across the street.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. PIRAEUS, GREECE - DAY (1803)

The sun beats down on the bustling port city of Piraeus. Masts and rigging of ships tower above the crowded docks. People of all ages hurry to and fro, their faces a blur as they go about their daily business.

CUT TO:

INT. ALEXANDROS' TAVERN - DAY

We see ALEXANDROS (30s), a gruff but kind-hearted tavern owner, polishing a mug with a dirty rag. His wife, ELENA (20s), a beautiful and lively woman, is busy in the kitchen, preparing lunch for the patrons.

ALEXANDROS
(to his son, GEORGIOS)
Georgios, come help me with the books. We need to balance the ledger before the day's over.

GEORGIOS (10) looks up from his game of checkers with a friend and reluctantly gets up to join his father at the counter.

CUT TO:

EXT. PIRAEUS - DAY

As the sun begins its descent, casting long shadows across the city, we see a figure watching the tavern from afar. It's THEODORA (25), a young and mysterious woman with striking features. She's been in Piraeus for only a few days, but rumors of her arrival have already spread like wildfire.

CUT TO:

INT. ALEXANDROS' TAVERN - LATER

Theodora walks into the tavern, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone. The patrons turn to look at her, some curious, others suspicious. Georgios looks up from his game and stares, transfixed by her beauty.

ALEXANDROS
(to Elena)
Looks like we've got a new face in town.

ELENA
(whispering back)
I heard she's on the run from someone.

Theodora makes her way to the bar, ordering a cup of wine as if she'd been there many times before. Georgios can't take his eyes off her.

CUT TO:

EXT. PIRAEUS - NIGHT

As night falls over Piraeus, Theodora slips out of the tavern and into the shadows. She walks along the waterfront, looking out at the stars twinkling above the sea.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the darkness. It's VICTOR (30s), a charming but ruthless smuggler with connections to the British Navy. He's been searching for Theodora, intent on capturing her and using her knowledge for his own gain.

VICTOR
(to Theodora)
You know I've been looking all over for you. Thought we had an understanding.

Theodora turns to face him, a fierce determination burning in her eyes.

THEODORA
I thought we did too, Victor. But it seems our interests have changed.

With that, she turns and runs, disappearing into the night. Victor gives chase, but Theodora is too quick. She vanishes into the crowded streets of Piraeus, leaving Victor to seethe with frustration.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. CALDWELL, OREGON - DAY

The camera pans over the small town of Caldwell, Oregon, nestled in the heart of the Willamette Valley. We see a picturesque main street with old-fashioned storefronts and a bustling farmer's market.

CUT TO:

INT. COWANSVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

We meet our protagonist, CAPTAIN JENNY MASON (35), a no-nonsense, sharp-witted investigator in her mid-30s. She's standing in the midst of a chaotic police station, surrounded by her team: DETECTIVE TOM HARRIS (40), a seasoned veteran; and YOUNG AND ambitious Detective Emily Santos (25).

JENNY
(frustrated)
I don't care what kind of 'evidence' they found. This is still just a dead-end case.

TOM
(skeptical)
With all due respect, Captain, we can't ignore the facts. That body was dumped on the outskirts of town with no signs of foul play... or so it seems.

EMILY
(eagerly)
And what about the witnesses? The ones who claimed to have seen something suspicious around that warehouse?

JENNY
(sternly)
The same people who recanted their statements five minutes later? No, I don't want to waste any more resources on this. We've got a real case, and we need to focus.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

We see a dilapidated warehouse on the outskirts of Caldwell, its windows boarded up, and an eerie silence surrounding it. Suddenly, we hear footsteps crunching through broken glass.

EMILY
(whispering)
Look...

TOM
(shining his flashlight into the darkness)
I don't like this one bit.

JENNY
(pulling out a small notebook)
I've got a hunch that this might be connected to an old case from ten years ago. One that was never solved.

CUT TO:

INT. COWANSVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

As Jenny begins to research the cold case, she discovers a chilling connection between the events unfolding in Caldwell and a similar occurrence in a nearby town.

JENNY
( eyes scanning documents)
This is more than just a coincidence... It's a pattern.

Suddenly, Emily bursts into the room, holding a phone.

EMILY
(frantically)
Captain Mason! We've got something. The victim from that warehouse... it wasn't just any body. I've matched the DNA to an old case file...

JENNY
(interrupting)
Tell me more.

As Jenny listens intently, Emily's words become a chilling revelation: the town of Caldwell is not as safe as everyone thought. In fact, its residents are living in the shadow of a dark, seemingly unstoppable force.

FADE TO BLACK.

This script sets up the main characters and introduces the core mystery that drives the series. The episode establishes Jenny Mason as a tough but fair investigator who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth.<end>
