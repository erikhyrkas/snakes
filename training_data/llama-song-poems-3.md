Verse 1:
We were wild and free, our hearts beating fast
Summer days and laughter that would surely last
We danced under stars on a warm summer night
Our love was pure, a spark that shone so bright
We thought we'd found forever in each other's eyes
But forever's come and gone, and I'm left with goodbyes

Chorus:
Oh, first love, you stole my heart away
With one glance, you lit up the summer day
I'll always remember the way it used to be
First love, my first love, etched in memory

Verse 2:
We talked of dreams and our hearts' deepest desires
Promises were made on whispers and secret fires
Our love was like a wildfire that burned so true
But like all things, it had to end, and I'm left feeling blue
I thought we'd last, but forever's come and gone
And now I'm left with just this song

Chorus:
Oh, first love, you stole my heart away
With one glance, you lit up the summer day
I'll always remember the way it used to be
First love, my first love, etched in memory

Time may have taken us far apart
But I still feel your touch, deep within my heart
The memories linger, a bittersweet refrain
Reminding me of what we had, and what could never remain
In those summer days, our hearts were on fire
And though it's gone, I'll always desire

Chorus:
Oh, first love, you stole my heart away
With one glance, you lit up the summer day
I'll always remember the way it used to be
First love, my first love, etched in memory<end>

The weight of my struggles, it seemed to weigh me down back home

Through the darkness and the pain, to a brand new day

But I'm reaching out to you, across this troubled sea
I'm searching for a way, to set my heart and soul free
To find common ground, where love can be the key
To mend what's been broken, and let our hearts beat as one, you'll see

And find a new beginning, where our love will be strong

The city's awake outside my window instead
Of the memories I'd made, of laughter and of tears

I'm left with just this emptiness, feeling like a failure

Chorus:
Oh, regret, it's a weight that I carry every day
A burden that I bear, in every single way

Regret, oh regret, will you be my guide tonight?

Verse 2:
I think of all the chances I took, but never made the leap
The dreams I had, the things I wanted to achieve
But fear got in the way, and I let it hold me down
Now those moments pass me by, like a silent town
I wish I could turn back time, to relive what I've missed
But life keeps moving on, and my regrets persist

Chorus:
Oh, regret, it's a weight that I carry every day
A burden that I bear, in every single way
It's the "what ifs" and the "maybes" that keep me awake at night
Regret, oh regret, will you be my guide tonight?

Verse 3:
I see the people who've moved on, they're doing just fine
They're living life to the fullest, while I'm stuck in this mind
I wonder what would have been, if I took a different path
But all I can do is learn from it, and hope that someday I'll break free at last
The ghosts of my past, they whisper my name
Reminding me of the choices I made

Chorus:
Oh, regret, it's a weight that I carry every day
A burden that I bear, in every single way
It's the "what ifs" and the "maybes" that keep me awake at night
Regret, oh regret, will you be my guide tonight?<end>

Compose a song about technological advances.<start>(Verse 1)
In a world where screens are always bright
We're chasing progress, day and night
Our fingers fly across the screen
As we try to keep up with what's unseen
We're living life in a digital haze
Where time is money, and speed is praise

Can we connect, without a digital face?
In this endless sea of ones and zeroes high
Are we losing touch, or just passing by?

(Verse 2)
We're missing moments, in the stillness deep
As our thoughts are fragmented, like a screen that's asleep
We're trying to recall, what life was like before
But memories fade fast, on the digital floor
We're trading love and laughter, for a fleeting fame
And wondering if we'll ever feel the same

But can we find our way, through the noise and space?
Can we connect, without a digital face?
In this endless sea of ones and zeroes high
Are we losing touch, or just passing by?

A world that's imperfect, but still untold
Perhaps it's time, to look away from the screen
And find our way back, to the love that's real within<end>

Compose a poem about traditional vs. modern.<start>In traditional streets, where lanterns glow

In the shadows, I see you there
A smile so bright, but not quite fair
You're living life in a world that's mine
But every choice we make, creates a different line
We touch and pass each other by
Two paths diverged, with tears in our eyes

Maybe someday, our hearts will align
And we'll find our way, through the universe's design

(Verse 2)
I remember laughter, and moments so bright
 Shared with you, on a warm summer night
But now we're strangers, in different skies
We're chasing sunsets, without each other's eyes

In a world where I'm alone, tonight

In parallel worlds, where love shines true
Maybe someday, our hearts will align
And we'll find our way, through the universe's design

Two souls connected, on a brighter night
But until then, I'll hold on to the thought
That you're out there somewhere, with a love that's caught

In parallel worlds, where love shines true
Maybe someday, our hearts will align
And we'll find our way, through the universe's design<end>

And freedom's beauty is meant to be.<end>
Write a poem about ancient civilizations.<start>In ancient lands of sand and stone,

Compose a poem about modern society.<start>In city streets, where steel meets stone,

Of destruction's path, where few may go
The stormy night, it brings us pain
And leaves a trail, of shattered remains
Families torn, from loved ones dear
Their homes reduced, to just a tear

A strange glow that seemed to call, as my heart began to fly
It led me to a place, where shadows danced and played
And I felt a presence, that I couldn't explain or shade

(Chorus)
Oh, supernatural tonight
Where the unknown feels just right
We're chasing the spirits high
In this world of mystery and wonder why

(Verse 2)
I saw a ghostly figure, in my grandmother's old home
A whispering voice that seemed to know, where I'd been going wrong
It spoke of secrets and of lies, of love and bitter tears
And I felt a sorrow, that brought me to my knees for years

(Chorus)
Oh, supernatural tonight
Where the unknown feels just right
We're chasing the spirits high
In this world of mystery and wonder why

Maybe we're not alone, in this world of darkness and light
Maybe there's more to see, than what we can touch or feel tonight

Oh, supernatural tonight
Where the unknown feels just right
We're chasing the spirits high
In this world of mystery and wonder why<end>
Compose a song about fairytales retold.<start>**Verse 1**

But now she's breaking free from the spell
She's leaving behind the prince so fine
And finding her own happy ending in time

Our stories are our own, no longer a stage
We're taking control of our lives and fate
We're living the fairytales we create

Until one day, love came to drive the night away
Now his howls are lullabies to me and you
And the beast is beautiful, too

Our stories are our own, no longer a stage
We're taking control of our lives and fate
We're living the fairytales we create

Lived a queen with a heart that would forever last
Her memories were hers to keep, not yours to hold
She's learning to let go, her story unfold
No more secrets kept, no more lies told
She's finding herself, and it's a beautiful gold

**Chorus**
We're rewriting the tales, we're turning the page
Our stories are our own, no longer a stage
We're taking control of our lives and fate
We're living the fairytales we create<end>

I'm stuck in this middle ground, with no clear way out
Just tryin' to find my purpose, without too much doubt

A midlife moment of madness, that's where I wanna be
Gonna let my hair down, gonna break the mold

Living different worlds, yet connected we'll be
Trying to understand, each other's view
In this endless dance, of love and what we knew

Oh, we're a million miles apart, you and me
Living different worlds, yet connected we'll be
Trying to understand, each other's view
In this endless dance, of love and what we knew

Through the noise and chaos, to a brighter day
Where understanding flows, like a gentle stream
And the gaps between us, become just a dream<end>
