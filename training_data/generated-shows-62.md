The camera pans over a small, rural town, the streets deserted and still. We see a sign that reads "Blackwater" in faded letters.

CUT TO:

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

We find ourselves in a grand, but decaying mansion. The walls are cracked, the floors creaking beneath our feet. A figure, JESSICA (30s), stands at the edge of the room, looking out over the space. She's dressed in 19th century attire.

JESSICA:
(whispering to herself)
It's been a century... and yet...

Suddenly, a door slams shut behind her. Jessica spins around, but there's no one there.

CUT TO:

INT. MANSION - FLASHBACK

We see a younger Jessica (20s) standing in the same room. She's surrounded by candles, which flicker with an otherworldly energy. A figure, ABRAHAM (40s), stands across from her.

ABRAHAM:
(urgently)
You can't stay here, Jess! They're coming for you!

JESSICA:
(firmly)
I won't leave him behind. He's the one I love.

ABRAHAM:
(desperate)
Love? You think that's enough to keep them at bay?

Jessica takes a step forward, but Abraham catches her arm.

CUT TO:

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

The camera returns to present-day Jessica, who looks as though she's been through a nightmare. She approaches a large mirror hanging on the wall.

JESSICA:

You... can see...

Jessica touches the glass, and it shatters into a thousand pieces. We're left with an eerie silence, punctuated only by the sound of her ragged breathing.

CUT TO:

INT. MANSION - FLASHBACK

We see Jessica (20s) running through the mansion's halls, pursued by unseen forces. She reaches the front door and flings it open, revealing a dark and stormy night outside.

JESSICA:
(desperate)
Abraham!

Suddenly, she trips and falls to her knees. The storm rages on around her as we see... visions of Abraham standing behind her, his eyes black as coal.

CUT TO:

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

The camera returns to present-day Jessica (30s), who stands panting in front of the shattered mirror. She looks around frantically for an escape route.

CUT TO:

EXT. BLACKWATER - NIGHT

The camera pans back to reveal a small figure standing at the edge of town. It's Jessica (20s), dressed in modern attire, watching as present-day Jessica is chased by some unseeable force.

Jessica disappears into the darkness, leaving us with only the faintest glimmer of hope that she might have escaped her own personal hell.

CUT TO:

INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

Jessica rushes into the office, where we see TOM (30), a charming and confident lawyer, sitting at his desk.

TOM

Hey, sorry I'm running behind too. I had an emergency call from a client.

JESSICA
(dropping her bag on the floor)
I know all about emergencies. That's why I'm here to discuss the Harrison case.

MIKE
(over the phone)
Hey, babe. I've been thinking about us... and I know we can work through our issues.

Jessica hesitates before answering.

JESSICA
(firmly)
Mike, it's over between us. We both knew that when you started seeing Emily behind my back.

There is a pause on the other end of the line.

MIKE
(suddenly angry)
Emily? You're still mad about her?

Jessica takes a deep breath before responding.

JESSICA

No, I'm not mad anymore. I just want to move on with my life.

The call ends, and Jessica looks relieved but also haunted by the memories of their toxic relationship.

CUT TO:

We meet our lead agent, JACK (40s), a no-nonsense, sharp-dressed man with a reputation for being one of the best in the business. He's joined by his partner, LUCY (30s), a skilled detective with a keen mind and a quick wit.

JACK
(to Lucy)
Alright, what do we have?

LUCY
(handing Jack a file)
New case. Woman found dead in an alleyway near the waterfront. The only clue is a silver necklace with a small charm of a snake on it.

Jack takes the file, examining the details.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The team from Phantom Task Force meets with their liaison, CAPTAIN SMITH (50s), to discuss the case.

CAPTAIN SMITH
This one's got everyone stumped. No ID on the victim, no surveillance footage. We've had nothing but dead ends so far.

JACK
We'll take it. I want you to get us every detail on the victim and the crime scene.

CAPTAIN SMITH
Alright, Jack. You know what this means...

Jack nods knowingly. It's clear that there are some old wounds here, some unfinished business between Jack and Captain Smith.

CUT TO:

EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

The team begins to process the scene, looking for any clues that might have been missed by the initial responders.

LUCY
(examining the ground)
Hey, look at this.

JACK
What've you got?

LUCY
(leaning in close)
Looks like a piece of torn fabric. Could be from our victim's clothes... or someone else's.

Jack takes note of the find and begins to survey the area, taking in all the details.

CUT TO:

INT. PHANTOM TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The team is back at headquarters, poring over evidence and following up on leads.

The camera pans over a sprawling orbital platform, a hub of human activity in space. We see various vessels docked and undocked from the platform.

CUT TO:

INT. PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A group of scientists and engineers are gathered around a holographic display projected in front of them. They're all wearing virtual reality headsets that allow them to interface with the system.

SCIENTIST 1
(looking at data on his headset)
We've got a problem, folks. The K-37 sector is experiencing a catastrophic redshift event.

ENGINEER 2
(concerned)
That's impossible. We've run simulations... this can't happen.

SCIENTIST 2
(skeptical)
Maybe it's not just a simulation...

CUT TO:

INT. ORBITAL PLATFORM - DAY

We see the platform's security chief, Captain JENKINS, briefing her team on the situation.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(serious)
Alright, here's the situation: we've got a sector-wide redshift event occurring. Our sensors are picking up massive distortions in space-time, causing vessels to disappear into alternate dimensions.

SECURITY OFFICER 1
(confused)
But... but that means...

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(interrupting)
It means we're facing an unknown threat. We need to isolate the sector and prevent any further... 'incidents'.

CUT TO:

EXT. K-37 SECTOR - DAY

We see a massive, swirling vortex of energy in front of us. A group of rebels, led by a charismatic leader named AZRA, emerge from the edge of the platform.

This is it, people. This is our chance to take back what's rightfully ours: freedom.

CUT TO:

INT. PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The scientists and engineers are frantically trying to contain the redshift event.

SCIENTIST 3

Wait... I think I see a pattern here. It's not just a natural occurrence...

CUT TO:

EXT. K-37 SECTOR - DAY

Azra and her rebels launch a surprise attack on the platform, using advanced tech to bypass security measures.

AZRA
(to her crew)
Take out their communication arrays! We need to cut them off from the rest of the galaxy!

CUT TO:

INT. PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The scientists are shocked as they realize the true nature of the redshift event: it's not a natural phenomenon, but a deliberate act by Azra and her crew.

SCIENTIST 1
(awed)
This is... this is impossible. You're using an exotic matter generator...

ENGINEER 2
(amazed)
And manipulating space-time itself!

CUT TO:

EXT. K-37 SECTOR - DAY

The platform's defenses are collapsing as Azra's crew fights their way through.

AZRA

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE THRONE ROOM - DAY

Robin's father, EDMUND STARK (35), sits upon the Iron Throne, a stern expression on his face as he addresses the lords and ladies of the Seven Kingdoms.

EDMUND
...and so, we must be vigilant in our duties to the realm. The great war against the Night King has left its scars, but we will not let them define us.

The room erupts into murmurs of agreement and applause. Robin looks up from his gaze at the floor, a hint of curiosity sparking within him.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE LIBRARY - DAY

Robin's mother, LADY LYRA STARK (30), sits with her maester, AEGON HARTHORN (50), pouring over ancient tomes and scrolls.

LADY LYRA
Maester, what is the significance of this passage?

AEGON
(nodding)
Ah, yes. The prophecy of the Iron Throne. A reminder that true power lies not in conquest or wealth, but in wisdom and foresight.

Robin enters the library, his eyes scanning the shelves for a book on a nearby table.

LADY LYRA
(smiling)
Robin, you've been spending too much time with your father's advisors. It's time to focus on your studies.

ROBIN
(sheepishly)
Sorry, Mother.

AEGON
(chuckling)
No need to apologize, young one. A true leader must understand the weight of legacy and the burden it brings.

CUT TO:

EXT. WINTERFELL CASTLE - DAY

As Robin watches from a window, his father exits the castle with a small retinue of guards.

EDMUND
(whispering)
Maester Hartorn, I fear we have not done enough to prepare our people for what lies ahead. The whispers of war and power play are growing louder by the day.

AEGON
(nodding gravely)
Indeed, Your Lordship. The iron throne will soon be tested anew. We must be ready.

We see a team of scientists and engineers frantically working at their stations, surrounded by holographic displays and data streaming in from various nodes across the Ghostnet.

ZARA (30s), a brilliant but abrasive lead scientist, addresses her team.

ZARA
Alright, people! We have a situation on our hands. Node 47 has gone dark. Repeat, I need confirmation that this is not just a glitch...

Suddenly, a young engineer, TYLER (20s), raises his hand.

TYLER
Uh, Zara? I think I've got something here. It looks like Node 47 was hit with a high-level encryption packet... but the timestamp on it suggests it was sent from within our own network!

ZARA
(stunned)
What?

CUT TO:

INT. GHOSTNET CONTROL ROOM - LATER

The team scrambles to analyze the data streaming in, as Zara's expression turns increasingly grim.

ZARA
(to her team)
We've got a problem. It looks like someone - or something - has infiltrated our Ghostnet.

JAX (40s), a seasoned security expert, speaks up.

JAX
(zeroing in on Tyler)
Tell me you didn't just say that...

TYLER
(nervously)
I... I don't know what to say. It looks like the encryption was embedded by someone who knows our own protocols...

ZARA
(grimly)
Tyler, get a team together and track down the source of this packet. Now.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW ATLANTIS - DAY

As Zara's team springs into action, we see glimpses of chaos erupting throughout the city: streets filled with panicked crowds; buildings shuddering under mysterious energy signatures.

The camera lingers on a figure standing at the edge of the city - a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She watches the mayhem unfold without expression.

CUT TO:

INT. GHOSTNET CONTROL ROOM - LATER

Zara's team has isolated the source of the encryption packet: an abandoned server room in the depths of New Atlantis, hidden behind layers of encrypted firewalls.

TYLER
(excitedly)
We can get into it! But... if this is what I think it is...

JAX
(glowering)
Tell me it's just a glitch.

TYLER
(nervously)
I don't know. But if you're ready to face the worst-case scenario... then yeah. We can do this.

Zara gives a curt nod.

ZARA
(to Tyler and Jax)
Alright, let's get in there. And be careful. We don't know what we're up against yet.

It's just been really weird lately. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. I see things out of the corner of my eye, but when I turn to look, there's no one there.

DR. WATSON
(concerned)
I've been feeling a bit strange myself lately. But tell me more about what you mean by "seeing things."

JENNY

It's just...little things. Like, I'll be walking down the street and see someone who looks exactly like my ex-boyfriend. But then they turn around and it's not him at all.

DR. WATSON

And what about when this happens? Do you feel any sense of unease or discomfort?

So, what brings you to the city? I couldn't help but notice you're new here.

JESSICA
(nervously)
Just a promotion. What about you?

MAX
(sheepishly)
I'm a writer. Just trying to make it big in the publishing world.

CUT TO:

INT. NEW TERRA CITY - DAY

We meet our protagonist, MAYA (28), a brilliant scientist who has dedicated her life to finding a solution to the world's energy crisis. She works at the prestigious Terra Institute, alongside her mentor and friend, DR. LENA (45).

MAYA
(reading from a holographic display)
The latest data suggests that our solar flare shield is online and stable. We're getting close to tapping into the planet's untapped energy reserves.

LENA
(smiling)
You've done it again, Maya. You're a genius.

Suddenly, the lab's alarm system blares to life.

LENA
(concerned)
What's going on?

MAYA
(frustrated)
I don't know! We must be experiencing some kind of resonance feedback from the flare shield.

The camera shakes and wavers as a massive energy surge floods the lab. The crew rushes to contain it, but it's too late. The flare shield collapses, unleashing an unfathomable amount of energy into the atmosphere.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW TERRA CITY - DAY

The city is thrown into chaos as the flare shield's collapse sets off a chain reaction of devastating earthquakes and tidal waves. Buildings crumble, streets are littered with debris, and people run for their lives.

We see MAYA, LENA, and their colleagues fighting to survive amidst the mayhem. They discover that the energy surge has awakened an ancient entity - a being from another realm, known as the Inferno Lord (I.L.).

The I.L. begins to manifest across the city, its power coursing through the planet's core like liquid fire. The skies darken, and flames erupt everywhere.

CUT TO:

INT. TERRA INSTITUTE - DAY

Maya realizes that her research may have inadvertently unleashed this catastrophe. Horrified by what she has done, Maya sets out to find a way to stop the Inferno Lord before it's too late.

**Act III:**

As MAYA navigates the treacherous landscape of New Terra City, she encounters a mysterious figure named ZAREK (30), who claims to possess knowledge about the I.L. and its motivations.

ZAREK
(gravely serious)
The Inferno Lord seeks to purify this world - to cleanse it of humanity's destructive tendencies and restore balance to the planet's delicate ecosystem.

MAYA
(determined)
But at what cost? Innocent lives are being lost by the minute!

ZAREK
(shrugs)
Perhaps they would have perished anyway, given humanity's track record. The I.L. is simply hastening the inevitable.

Maya and Zarek engage in a philosophical debate as they desperately seek a solution to stop the inferno from consuming everything.

**Epilogue:**

As the I.L.'s power grows exponentially, Maya stumbles upon an ancient prophecy that hints at her own destiny - to either save humanity or succumb to the Inferno Lord's will. The fate of New Terra City hangs in the balance.

EL'GORIN
(whispering to herself)
The prophecy... it must be true...

Suddenly, the door creaks open and a young woman, ARIA (20s), enters. Her long, raven hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of night.

ARIA
El'gorin, I've found something.

ELGORIN
(looking up)
What is it?

ARIA
(holding out a small, ornate box)
This was hidden in the ruins of the old temple. It's bound with Nightshroud...

El'gorin's eyes widen as she takes the box from Aria.

Aria and El'GORIN venture deeper into the forest, following a narrow path that winds through the mist-shrouded trees. The air grows thick with an otherworldly energy.

Eira is surrounded by a group of advisors, all dressed in ornate robes, their faces concerned.

ADVISOR 1
(with a hint of urgency)
My Queen, the prophecy has foretold of great danger approaching. The dark sorcerer, Malakai, seeks to claim our lands for himself.

We see a group of friends, all in their mid-to-late 30s, gathered in Lucy's living room for what appears to be a dinner party.

LUCY (played by Jen Kirkman), the hostess with the mostess, stands at the kitchen counter, surrounded by her friends: PAUL (played by Adam Pally), a lovable but slightly narcissistic friend; TASHA (played by Ashley D. Howard), a hippie-in-training who's always on about "the universe"; EDDIE (played by Michaela Watkins), Lucy's eccentric aunt; and JASON (played by Brian Huskey), a self-proclaimed "survival expert" who's brought his own brand of doom-mongering.

LUCY
Alright, everyone! Let's get this apocalypse party started!

The friends all cheer and take their seats at the table.

PAUL
(to Tasha) I'm telling you, if there's a zombie outbreak, we're not going to make it through the first night. I mean, have you seen my abs? (flexes)

TASHA
(laughing) Oh, Paul! You think your abs are going to save us?

PAUL
Deadly serious, Tasha.

EDDIE
(starting to get agitated)
You know what's not funny? The fact that we're all just sitting here, waiting for the apocalypse. We should be preparing!

JASON
(in a hushed tone) You guys don't understand. I've got my bug-out bag right in the car. We need to have an evacuation plan.

LUCY
(laughing) Oh boy, Jason's getting serious about the end of the world...

Suddenly, the lights flicker and the TV starts playing a loop of the same 10 seconds of footage from the movie "2012".

PAUL
(excitedly) Guys! I think it's happening!

TASHA
(calmly) Paul, that's just the apocalypse channel.

EDDIE
(nearly in tears)
This is not funny anymore. We should be taking precautions.

JASON
(serious as a heart attack)
I'm telling you, we need to get out of here. Now.

LUCY

Okay, okay. Let's just...let's calm down...

The friends all begin to panic and argue with each other, while the TV continues to loop its apocalyptic footage.

Okay, let's just assume the worst-case scenario: zombies!

TASHA
(gathering candles and essential oils)
And we'll just...meditate our way through it...

EDDIE
(grabbing her bug-out bag)
I've got my emergency rations right here!

JASON
(starting to get more and more agitated) You guys don't understand! We need to have a real plan of action!

LUCY
(trying to maintain order)
Okay, okay...let's just take some deep breaths...

As the friends continue to argue and prepare for the apocalypse in their own peculiar ways, the camera cuts back and forth between them, capturing the absurdity and humor in this nightmarish dinner party.

LUCY

PAUL
(proudly) Yeah, we've got this. We just need to stick together and...

Suddenly, a group of people walks by, completely unaware of the impending doom.

TASHA
(smiling)
See? The universe is all about finding inner peace...in the face of destruction.

The friends share a laugh as the camera zooms out to reveal a chaotic world outside their little bubble.

JACK
(gripping his rifle)
You've got some 'splainin' to do, Specter.

My king, I bring grave news from the countryside. The people are growing restless. Rumors of a prophecy have spread, foretelling the return of the ancient magic that once flowed through our lands.

KING KAEL
(scoffs)
Prophecies are for fools and children. I'll not be swayed by such nonsense.

LORD ARIN
(bows)
As you wish, my king. But perhaps we should reconsider our... "encouragement" of the mage community? Their skills could prove useful in these uncertain times.

KING KAEL
(sneers)
Useful? They're nothing but a threat to our power. I'll not be swayed by their whispers and incantations.

Suddenly, the doors burst open and a young woman, EIRA (22), enters with a small, fiery creature perched on her shoulder.

EIRA
(bowing)
Forgive me, your majesty. I come bearing... information?

KING KAEL
(suspiciously)
What is it that you have to say for yourself, girl?

EIRA
(calmly)
I've been studying the ancient lore. I believe the prophecy speaks of a chosen one, a being with the power to wield both Ember and Ash.

KING KAEL
(anger rising)
You dare imply that I'm not worthy? That some... peasant is more qualified than me?

EIRA
(firmly)
Not at all, your majesty. But perhaps you should consider what it means for our kingdom if this prophecy is true...

King Kael's expression darkens, and he raises his hand to summon the guards.

You'll be... "reminding" me of my duties, won't you?

No... wait... wasn't Emily supposed to meet someone? But I don't know who or what it was about.

We're in a bustling saloon, filled with patrons sipping whiskey and playing cards. We see JACE (30s), a rugged cowboy with a quick wit and sharp tongue. He's sitting at the bar, talking to the bartender, MARCY (40s).

JACE
(smirking)
You're telling me, Marcie, that the fastest man in Wyoming has gone missing?

MARCY
(shaking her head)
Word is, he was last seen heading into the nearby canyon. Some folks say they saw him arguing with a stranger.

JACE
(leaning in)
A stranger, you say? Sounds like trouble to me.

CUT TO:

EXT. WYOMING TERRITORY - DAY

We see Jace riding his horse, a beautiful black stallion named Midnight. He's heading towards the canyon, following the trail left behind by the missing cowboy.

CUT TO:

INT. CANYON - DAY

Jace dismounts and ties up Midnight. He draws his gun and begins to explore the canyon. Suddenly, he hears a noise and turns around.

A figure emerges from the shadows. It's LUCAS (30s), a mysterious stranger with a scar above his left eyebrow.

LUCAS
(smirking)
Well, well, well. If it isn't Jace, the fastest man in Wyoming... or so I've heard.

JACE
(gun still drawn)
What do you want?

LUCAS
(chuckling)
Oh, I think you know exactly what I'm after. The gold that's been hidden deep within this canyon for years.

CUT TO:

EXT. CANYON - LATER

A tense standoff ensues as Jace and Lucas engage in a heated argument. Suddenly, a third figure emerges from the shadows. It's MAYBELLE (20s), a beautiful young woman with piercing green eyes.

MAYBELLE
(fierce)
You'll never take that gold, Lucas!

LUCAS
(sneering)
Oh? And why not?

MAYBELLE
(smiling sweetly)
Because I'm the one who hid it here.

CUT TO:

EXT. WYOMING TERRITORY - DAY

The sun is setting over the horizon as Jace watches Maybelle and Lucas engage in a fierce battle. He knows he has to act fast, or risk losing everything.

JACE
(to himself)
Time for me to put my skills to the test.

CUT TO:

EXT. CANYON - LATER

A thrilling gunfight ensues as Jace takes on both Maybelle and Lucas. The two of them prove to be formidable opponents, but Jace's quick thinking and sharp reflexes ultimately give him the upper hand.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

The dust settles as Jace walks into the saloon, gun still in hand. Marcy greets him with a smile.

MARCY
(smiling)
Welcome back, Jace! We've got some news for you!

JACE
(smirking)
What is it?

MARCY
(grinning)
Word is, the gold has been found... and Maybelle's the one who hid it here all along!

The camera pans out as Jace raises an eyebrow, intrigued by the revelation.

EXT. LAST CHANCE - DAY

The sun beats down on the small town of Last Chance, nestled in the heart of the Arizona Territory. We see a sign that reads "Welcome to Last Chance" and a main street lined with dusty buildings.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

We see JASON (40s, rugged cowboy) and MIKE (30s, young gunslinger), two lawmen on horseback, tying up their horses outside the saloon. They enter, looking for information about a recent string of robberies in the area.

JASON
(to Mike)
Alright, I've heard there's been some trouble out at the McGowan ranch. Maybe someone here knows something.

MIKE
(looking around the room)
I don't see anyone we can trust. This whole town seems to be holding its breath.

As they scan the room, their eyes land on a young woman, SARAH (20s), sitting alone at a table, nursing a whiskey. Jason and Mike approach her.

JASON
We're looking for information about some recent robberies in the area. Do you know anything?

SARAH
(hesitant)
I might know something... but I'm not sure if it's worth getting involved.

MIKE
(gently)
Ma'am, we just want to help keep this town safe. What do you know?

Sarah glances around the room nervously before speaking in a low tone.

SARAH
It was those brothers, the Watsons. They've been causing trouble for months. They're the ones who robbed the bank at Red Rock last week.

JASON
(looking at Mike)
We need to pay them a visit.

CUT TO:

EXT. WATSON RANCH - DAY

Jason and Mike approach the Watson ranch on horseback, guns drawn. The two brothers, JOE (20s) and JIM (30s), emerge from the house, looking menacing.

JASON
(lowering his gun)
We're here about the robberies in the area. You boys know anything about that?

JOE
(sneering)
We don't know what you're talking about.

MIKE
(eyeballing Jim)
Save it, kid. We've got witnesses. It's over.

The Watsons exchange a look before Joe pulls out a gun and tries to shoot Mike. Jason intervenes, disarming him. In the ensuing scuffle, Jim gets knocked to the ground by Mike.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAST CHANCE - DAY

As the sun begins to set on Last Chance, Jason and Mike ride back into town, the Watsons in tow. Sarah steps out of the saloon, looking relieved.

SARAH
(smiling)
Thanks for doing that. This town can be a real challenge sometimes.

JASON
(smirking)
Just another day on the job, ma'am.

FADE TO BLACK.
