**INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY**

We see a group of people in their mid-twenties to early thirties standing around, chatting and laughing. Suddenly, the camera pans out to reveal a giant high school reunion banner on the wall.

**JASON (30s)**: (excitedly) Oh my god, can you believe it's been 15 years?

**SARAH (28)**: ( rolling her eyes) Yeah, because what could possibly go wrong with revisiting the worst time of our lives?

As they catch up and reminisce, we see flashbacks of their high school days.

CUT TO:

**FLASHBACK - HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM**

Young Jason is trying to impress a girl by showing off his "sweet" hair gel skills. His friends are equally as awkward, making fun of each other's outfits.

As the group continues their reunion festivities, we meet more characters: there's Brian (the class clown), Emily (the ex-cheerleader turned vegan activist), and Michael (the ex-star quarterback with a questionable haircut).

**BRIAN (29)**: So, who's up for another round of "I'm so glad I left this place"?

As they all nod in agreement, the principal (played by a wacky comedic actor) bursts onto the scene.

**PRINCIPAL SMITH**: Alright, kids! Gather 'round. We've got some business to attend to!

It turns out Principal Smith has decided to hold a high school reunion... at the old school itself.

**SARAH**: (whispering to Jason) This is going to be a disaster.

CUT TO:

**INT. CLASSROOM - DAY**

As they're shown their old classrooms, Michael tries to relive his glory days by showing off his "dunking" skills on the high school basketball court. However, he ends up with a embarrassing face-plant into a trash can.

Meanwhile, Emily gets caught up in an argument with her ex-classmate over who was the real queen bee of the school.

**EMILY**: I was the one with the perfect hair and makeup every day!

**SARAH (laughing)**: Oh yeah? Well, I was the one who always got to sit next to you at lunch because you wouldn't eat anything that wasn't organic!

As tensions rise, Jason tries to mediate by suggesting they all play a game of "Who could do what 15 years ago?"

**JASON**: (excitedly) Oh man, let's get this party started! Who could sing the loudest?

CUT TO:

**INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY**

The group gathers on stage for a rendition of their old school fight song. However, things quickly go awry as they all end up competing to see who can do the most ridiculous dance move.

As they're singing and dancing, we cut back to flashbacks of their high school lives, showing how these people came to be the silly, slightly dysfunctional adults they are today.

**INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY**

As the game reaches its climax, Principal Smith bursts in again, this time with a microphone in hand.

**PRINCIPAL SMITH**: Alright kids! Let's wrap things up with a bang!

He starts DJing and drops an epic rendition of "We Are Family". The whole school erupts into a wild dance party.

CUT TO:

**INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER**

As the night winds down, we see our characters laughing and embracing each other's quirks.

JESSICA
(to a customer)
So, you're looking for a wine to pair with your grilled salmon?

CUSTOMER 1
Yeah, something light and crisp.

Jessica looks concerned as she scans the area. Suddenly, she sees a figure stumbling towards her from across the vineyard. It's EMILY (28), a young and aspiring winemaker, who works for Lucas at Vino Vita.

EMILY

The camera pans over the darkened vineyard as the sun sets on Napa Valley. We see a figure lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, Emily rushes out to Jessica, who's standing by the entrance of the winery.

EMILY
(urgently)
Jessica, I didn't mean to scare you earlier...but I think I found something that will change everything...

As Emily hands Jessica a small notebook, the camera zooms in on the pages. We see cryptic messages scrawled across the paper: "They're hiding something...the truth is in the wine..."

Hello? Fury?

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the darkness - a woman with short, spiky hair and piercing green eyes. She's dressed in similar tactical gear to Jaxson.

FURY (30s) is revealed to be a skilled fighter and strategist. She looks at Jaxson with a mix of recognition and wariness.

FURY
Lower your gun, Jaxson. We need to talk.

JAXSON
(easing his grip on the pistol)
It's been a long time, Fury. What are you doing here?

We find ourselves in a dimly lit library, filled with dusty tomes and ornate decorations. Our host, ELEANOR (30s), stands before a roaring fireplace, addressing a small gathering of guests.

As the evening wears on, the party moves outside to the beautifully manicured gardens. We see our host mingling with her guests, including a charming businessman, JASON (40s), and his stunning wife, SARAH (30s). However, as the night deepens, tensions begin to rise.

GRANNY JENKINS (60s), a frail but feisty woman, sits on her couch, surrounded by stacks of old books and curious trinkets. She's talking to her granddaughter, MOLLY (20s).

GRANNY
...and then I said to him, "You can't just eat someone's memories." He just smiled and said, "Oh, but I can."

MOLLY
(skeptical)
Granny, you've told me that story a million times. What does it have to do with anything?

GRANNY
(leaning in)
That man was the Memory Eater. People came from all around to see him, to let him eat their memories. But be careful, sweetie. He has a taste for more than just pain.

Molly rolls her eyes and gets up to leave, but Granny stops her.

GRANNY
(serious)
You remember that day last week when you were out walking? You said something to me about seeing a man in the woods...

MOLLY
(hesitant)
Oh...I don't know what you're talking about. I was just out for a walk, that's all.

Granny's expression turns grave.

Don't lie to me, Molly. You saw him. And if he comes for us...

The lights flicker and the room grows cold.

CUT TO:

We see a figure walking through the trees, dressed in long coat and fedora. It's the Memory Eater. He moves with an unsettling calm, his eyes taking in every detail of the landscape.

As he walks, we see glimpses of people around Blackwater: a young couple embracing; an old man sitting alone on his porch; a group of kids playing tag in the park. The Memory Eater approaches each person, and as he does, their memories begin to fade away like mist in the sun.

Granny's apartment is now empty and silent. Molly returns, looking frightened.

The Memory Eater enters the room, his eyes fixed on Granny.

GRANNY

You can't eat our memories, not here in Blackwater. This is where we hold on tightest.

Granny stands her ground as the Memory Eater approaches.

We remember.

The Memory Eater's face contorts with rage, but Granny's words seem to have a strange effect on him. His body begins to...unravel?

**INT. HAPPIEST HOUR HEROES BAR - DAY**

We see a group of friends, all in their mid-30s, sitting at the bar, surrounded by pool tables and retro video games.

JASON (played by a charismatic comedic lead), the self-proclaimed "Mayor of Happy Hour", holds court as he recounts his latest adventure to his friends.

JASON: "...and then I convinced the pizza delivery guy that we were actually a SWAT team on a stakeout, and he just left the whole pie right outside our door!"

The group erupts in laughter, and we see their reactions:

* SARAH (played by a witty, sarcastic comedic foil) rolls her eyes good-naturedly.
* TOM (played by a lovable slacker with a passion for fantasy novels) high-fives Jason enthusiastically.
* LUCY (played by a quirky artist with a flair for drama) gasps dramatically, "You're like the Pizza Ninja!"

As they continue to chat and joke around, we see flashbacks of Jason's earlier escapades:

* **FLASHBACK 1**: We see Jason trying to order pizza with a fake mustache, only to be outdone by his friend Steve (played by a goofy, over-the-top comedic sidekick).
* **FLASHBACK 2**: Jason attempts to "help" the delivery guy by grabbing the pizza and running off with it.

Back in the present, the group decides to take matters into their own hands. They hatch a plan to steal a giant pie from the rival bar down the street, just to prove they can do it better than the guys at that place.

As they execute their scheme, things quickly spiral out of control:

* SARAH accidentally locks herself in the pizza box.
* TOM tries to "psychically" communicate with the security guards, but ends up scaring them off by doing a loud magic trick.
* LUCY gets distracted by a street performer and starts drawing him instead of helping.

Meanwhile, Jason finds himself facing off against their arch-nemesis: Vinnie (played by a gruff, lovable comedic villain), owner of the rival bar. They engage in an epic pizza-themed battle:

VINNIE: "You'll never take our pizza! It's got our secret sauce – made with love and disappointment!"

JASON: "That may be true, but we've got... (dramatic pause) ...the power of friendship!"

In the end, they manage to steal the pie and bring it back to Happy Hour Heroes. As they celebrate their victory, we see a montage of them devouring slices of pizza and making merry.

**CLOSING SHOT**: The group sits at the bar, laughing and joking around as the camera pans out to reveal the sign on the Happy Hour Heroes Bar: "Where friendship is always on the menu."

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a misty, autumnal landscape in 12th century England. We see the imposing structure of a medieval abbey in the distance.

Narrator (voiceover): "It's 1170, and the Holy Roman Empire has just been reorganized under Frederick Barbarossa. The winds of change are blowing across Europe, but in the quiet corners of England, a different kind of revolution is brewing."

We meet our protagonist, Brother Edwin, a young monk at the abbey, as he stirs a cauldron of bubbling ale outside the monastery kitchen.

Brother Edwin: (to his fellow monk, Brother Thomas) "I don't like it when Father Michael takes too much interest in our affairs. It's almost as if he knows something."

Brother Thomas: "What could he know? We're just simple monks."

Edwin: "You'd be surprised what secrets we keep here." Edwin glances around nervously, ensuring they are not overheard.

As they continue their work, the camera lingers on the lush foliage surrounding the abbey. Suddenly, a group of rugged men, seemingly travelers or soldiers, approach the gates. Their leader, Sir Edward, demands entry to speak with the Abbot.

Sir Edward: "We've come from York. Our party's been ambushed by bandits. We seek shelter and assistance."

Abbot Michael steps forward, intrigued by the commotion.

Abbot Michael: (firmly but warmly) "Welcome, travelers. You are safe here. Brother Edwin, show them to our guest quarters. I'll speak with you in a moment."

**Act II:**

As night falls, we follow Brother Edwin as he delivers ale and bread to the weary travelers in the guest quarters.

Brother Edwin (whispering to Thomas): "Those men didn't look like ordinary travelers. There's something they're hiding."

Thomas: "What makes you think that?"

Edwin: "It was in their eyes... a fire that burns deep within them. They're not here by chance. Something bigger is at play."

Meanwhile, Abbot Michael receives Sir Edward and his men in his chambers.

Abbot Michael (sipping ale): "I sense your urgency, Sir Edward. What troubles you so?"

Sir Edward: "We've received a message from the Earl of York himself... asking for our help with a matter of utmost importance. It concerns Lady Isabella."

The abbot's expression turns serious as he listens intently.

Abbot Michael: (leaning forward) "Go on, Sir Edward. Tell me more."

**Act III:**

As the night wears on, tensions rise within and outside the abbey walls. We see glimpses of a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows around the perimeter. This is Brother Edwin's sister, Elara, who has been hiding secrets of her own.

Brother Thomas (whispering to Edwin): "You've got to tell Father Michael about your sister, Edwin. He'll know what to do."

Edwin: "No... I couldn't possibly burden him with that now."

Suddenly, Lady Isabella appears in the guest quarters, accompanied by a small group of armed guards.

Lady Isabella (urgently): "I beg you, dear Abbot Michael, listen to my plea. My family's honor is at stake. We've been accused of heresy... a charge we deny."

As night descends into chaos and secrets begin to surface, our protagonist, Brother Edwin, finds himself caught between his duty as a monk and the unearthing of long-buried truths.

EXT. ANCIENT TEMPLE - DAY

We see a sprawling, ancient temple nestled deep within a dense jungle. The air is thick with humidity and the sounds of exotic birds fill the air.

CUT TO:

INT. TEMPLE ENTRANCE - DAY

A young woman, ERIKA (25), emerges from the underbrush, covered in dirt and leaves. She looks around cautiously, taking in her surroundings. As she approaches the temple entrance, a fierce storm rolls in, with lightning illuminating the dark sky.

ERIKA
(whispering to herself)
This is the place...

She pushes aside the vines covering the entrance and steps into the cool darkness within.

CUT TO:

INT. TEMPLE HALLWAY - DAY

Erika finds herself in a grand hallway, lined with ancient artifacts and mysterious symbols etched into the walls. She sees a pedestal at the far end of the hall, where an ornate box sits atop it.

ERIKA
(awestruck)
The Amulet...

Suddenly, she hears footsteps echoing through the hallway. A figure emerges from the shadows - Kael (30), a rugged and enigmatic warrior.

KAEL
(sneering)
You shouldn't be here.

ERIKA
(backing away)
I'm just looking for... something.

Kael raises his hand, revealing a sword at his side. Erika reacts instinctively, drawing a small dagger from her belt.

CUT TO:

EXT. TEMPLE COURTYARD - DAY

The storm rages on outside as the two engage in a fierce duel within the temple's courtyard. Blows are exchanged, and the sound of clashing steel echoes through the jungle.

As they fight, we see flashes of Erika's troubled past: memories of her mother, a renowned archaeologist who disappeared under mysterious circumstances; and glimpses of a dark presence lurking just out of sight - the Shadowhand.

CUT TO:

INT. TEMPLE HALLWAY - LATER

The battle subsides as Kael gains the upper hand. Erika is forced to retreat, but not before she spots an ancient text hidden within the temple's walls.

ERIKA
(grabbing the scroll)
This... this is it!

Kael lunges forward, only to be stopped by a sudden burst of energy emanating from the Amulet box on the pedestal. The room begins to shake, and Erika takes advantage of the distraction.

CUT TO:

EXT. TEMPLE COURTYARD - LATER

As the storm rages on outside, Erika makes her escape, leaving Kael and the Shadowhand behind. She disappears into the jungle, clutching the ancient scroll and a mysterious amulet that glows with an otherworldly light.

INT. JEN AND MIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We see JEN, a frazzled and anxious hostess, and her husband MIKE, a lovable but slightly oblivious everyman, in their small apartment. They're getting ready for a dinner party, with the help of their sassy best friend SARAH.

SARAH
Okay, okay, I've got it. The salad is done, the wine is chilling... what could possibly go wrong?

JEN
(nervously)
I don't know, but I'm still worried about Gary. He's always a little...much.

MIKE
(calmly)
Ah, come on Jen, Gary's a great guy! And he's bringing his famous three-bean salad!

SARAH
(drolly)
Yeah, because nothing says "dinner party" like a side dish that's been sitting in the fridge since the Clinton administration.

CUT TO:

INT. DINNER PARTY - NIGHT

The dinner guests arrive, and we meet GARY, a self-proclaimed " gourmet chef" with a passion for...well, being the center of attention; LAURA, Jen's quirky coworker who insists on wearing a chicken costume to the party (it's a "thing"); and TOM, Mike's lovable but slightly dim-witted buddy from high school.

As they mingle and enjoy the appetizers, things start to go off the rails. Gary spills his three-bean salad all over the carpet. Laura starts doing impressions of the guests behind their backs (including a spot-on Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump). And Tom proceeds to tell a 20-minute story about the time he accidentally superglued his shoes together.

Meanwhile, Jen is frantically trying to keep everything under control while Mike just sort of...exists in the background.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

As dinner is being served, things have reached critical mass. The food is a disaster (Gary's three-bean salad has somehow managed to make it back onto the table). Laura's chicken costume has gotten caught in the door. And Tom is...well, still talking.

Jen finally loses her cool and just gives up, shouting "IT'S A DINNER PARTY DISASTER!" as she throws up her hands in exasperation.

The guests stare at each other in shock, before bursting out laughing.

FADE TO BLACK.

Eira stops suddenly, looking around as if she senses something. Her eyes widen with alarm.

CUT TO:

INT. EIRA'S HIDEAWAY - DAY

Eira enters a small, intricately carved wooden cabin. Inside, we see a collection of strange, glowing artifacts and books on magic. Eira approaches a large, leather-bound tome and opens it, revealing pages filled with cryptic symbols.

CUT TO:

Eira enters a large, ornate treehouse, filled with elegant, refined elves. They're gathered around a central table, speaking in hushed tones. Eira approaches the leader of the group, ARIN (300), a regal, ethereal elf.

ARIN:
( gravely serious )
Eira, we've been expecting you. You're... later than expected.

ERIA:
(nervously)
I know. I had to... take care of something.

ARIN:
(skeptical)
A "something" that's causing the Nightshade to wither and die?

Eira hesitates, unsure how much to reveal.

CUT TO:

INT. EIRA'S FLASHBACK - DAY

We see a series of fragmented memories: Eira as a child, playing in the forest; her parents, killed by dark forces; Eira fleeing, pursued by shadowy creatures. The camera blurs and distorts, reflecting Eira's fractured emotions.

CUT TO:

EXT. NIGHTSHADE - LATER

Eira returns to the forest, this time with Arin and a group of elves in tow. They approach a massive, ancient tree, its bark twisted and gnarled.

ARIN:
( authoritatively )
This is where it begins. The Nightshade Rebellion.

ERIA:
(determined)
I'm ready.

The camera zooms out as the group charges into battle, the forest erupting around them in a maelstrom of color and sound.

CUT TO:

INT. WYVERN'S LAIR - DAY

A figure, Kael (30s), sits at a wooden table, surrounded by ancient tomes and scattered parchments. His dark hair is tied back in a ponytail, revealing piercing green eyes that seem to bore into the pages of the book before him.

KAEL
(to himself)
The Ironwood Crusade's true objective... it can't be just about eradicating the Wyrmkin. There has to be more to it...

Suddenly, a loud screech echoes through the lair, and Kael's companion, Eira (20s), bursts in.

EIRA
Kael! The scouts have returned with news from the north!

KAEL
(jumping up)
What is it?

EIRA
(holding out a map)
The Ironwood clan has taken control of the last remaining Wyrmkin sanctuary. They're using their magic to drive the creatures further into the wilderness.

KAEL
(eyes narrowing)
This changes everything...

CUT TO:

EXT. IRONWOOD CLAN CAMP - DAY

Kael and Eira approach a gathering of Ironwood warriors, who are led by their enigmatic leader, Thrain (40s).

THRAIN
(to Kael)
We've been expecting you. Our scouts have reported your presence in the Wyvern's Lair.

KAEL
(eyes locked on Thrain)
What do you want from me?

THRAIN
(smirking)
You see, we believe that the true enemy is not the Wyrmkin, but those who seek to exploit them for their own gain. We've been searching for allies in this crusade...

Eira exchanges a skeptical glance with Kael.

KAEL
(voice even)
And what makes you think I'm interested?

THRAIN
(leaning in)
We have reason to believe that you possess... certain abilities, ones that would be invaluable in our struggle against those who seek to desecrate the natural balance.

Kael's eyes flash with a mixture of anger and curiosity.

CUT TO:

EXT. IRONWOOD FORST - NIGHT

As the stars begin to twinkle overhead, Kael stands at the edge of the forest, gazing out into the darkness. Eira approaches him, a question in her eyes.

KAEL

I don't know yet...

We see JACE "BLACKJACK" MCALLISTER (35), a rugged and handsome cowboy, sitting at the bar, nursing a whiskey. He's dressed in black leather and wears a wide-brimmed hat to shield his face from the sun.

Suddenly, the swinging doors burst open and a young kid, JASON (18), rushes in, looking worried.

JASON
(to the bartender)
Hey, Vic! I need to talk to the sheriff!

VIC (the bartender)
What's goin' on?

JASON
(serious)
The new sheriff is here. His name is Marshal Ryan Jenkins.

Vic looks concerned and glances over at Blackjack.

BLACKJACK
(skeptical)
What about Sheriff Jackson? He was supposed to be our lawman until he retired last year...

JASON
(shrugs)
I don't know, Blackjack. Some folks are sayin' that Jenkins is trouble.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - DAY

Marshal Jenkins (30s) steps out of a horse-drawn carriage and approaches the town hall, where Sheriff Jackson (60s) awaits him. The townspeople gather around to watch the exchange.

JENKINS
(to Sheriff Jackson)
Sheriff Jackson, I'm here to assume my duties as Marshal of Red River. It's time for some... modern law enforcement in this fine town.

SHERIFF JACKSON
(suspicious)
You're not from around these parts, are you?

JENKINS
(smirks)
No, sir. I've come from a bigger city to bring some order and progress to Red River.

The townspeople begin to murmur among themselves, seeming uneasy about Jenkins' sudden arrival.

Blackjack stands outside the saloon, observing the scene unfolding between Marshal Jenkins and Sheriff Jackson.

DETECTIVE WINDSOR

This family has been hiding secrets for decades.

Suddenly, we hear footsteps coming from upstairs. A flustered butler, JENKINS (50s), rushes down to her.

JENKINS
Oh, Detective Windsor! I'm so glad you're here. The Smith family is in an uproar.

DETECTIVE WINDSOR
What seems to be the problem?

JENKINS
Mrs. Smith's most prized possession - a priceless diamond necklace - has gone missing.

We see Mrs. Smith (50s), the matriarch of the family, pacing back and forth in front of a large, wooden desk. Her husband, REGINALD (60s), is sitting behind the desk, looking guilty.

DETECTIVE WINDSOR
Mrs. Smith, I understand this necklace holds great sentimental value to you. Can you tell me where it was last seen?

MRS. SMITH
It was in my safe at 8 pm. I took it out for dinner and...and that's the last time anyone saw it.

DETECTIVE WINDSOR
I see. And when did you discover it was missing?

MRS. SMITH
Last night, around midnight. I went to bed thinking it would still be there this morning...

Reginald interrupts her, clearing his throat.

REGINALD
If I may interrupt, Detective...it's just that we've had some, ah, disagreements in the family lately. Perhaps one of us might have, shall we say...mislaid the necklace?

DETECTIVE WINDSOR
(skeptical)
I'll be looking into those "disagreements". Meanwhile, can I see the safe where the necklace was kept?

MRS. SMITH
(nervously)
Of course.

CUT TO:

INT. SAFE - NIGHT

Detective Windsor examines the safe, taking note of a small scratch on the wall nearby.

DETECTIVE WINDSOR

Looks like someone tried to get in here without triggering the alarm. This could be our first clue...

The camera pans over a small coastal town in Maine, the sound of seagulls and gentle waves filling the background.

We see JESSICA (28), a successful event planner from New York City, arriving at the local train station. She looks out of place among the quaint town's residents.

Jessica steps off the platform and into the arms of her brother, MIKE (30). They exchange warm hugs and Mike greets her with a wide smile.

MIKE
Hey, sis! It's great to see you!

JESSICA
(smiling back)
I'm happy to be here, Mike. I needed a break from the city.

As they walk towards the car, Jessica can't help but glance around at the charming town.

**Act II:**

Cut to Jessica and Mike arriving at their family home, a cozy beachside cottage. Their mother, KAREN (55), greets them with a warm smile and a plate of freshly baked cookies.

KAREN
Welcome home, sweetie! It's been too long!

Jessica is touched by the warmth of her family's welcome.

Later that evening, Mike takes Jessica to meet some of his friends at the local pub. They're all friendly and welcoming, but one person catches Jessica's eye: a handsome and charming stranger, ALEX (29).

As they strike up a conversation, Jessica feels an instant connection with Alex. They talk about everything from their jobs to their love of adventure.

**Act III:**

Over the next few days, Jessica and Alex spend more time together. They go on long walks along the beach, share stories, and laugh together.

Jessica is torn between her growing feelings for Alex and her reluctance to settle down in a small town. She's always dreamed of a high-powered career and hasn't planned on staying in Maine.

Meanwhile, Mike notices the chemistry between his sister and Alex and decides to encourage them to take a chance on each other.

As Jessica prepares to leave and return to New York City, she can't shake off her feelings for Alex. They share a romantic kiss on the beach as the sun sets behind them.

**Act IV:**

Back in Mike's car, driving Jessica back to the train station, they talk about their future plans.

EMILY: (whispering to Jason) Hey, Jason? Put that away. We're supposed to be taking notes.

JASON: (excitedly) Oh, cool! I'm pretty sure I'd make a great debater. I mean, I can argue with anyone.

Alright, we need to accelerate the project. We have 72 hours before the solar flare hits. If we can't stabilize the energy grid...

One of her scientists, DR. LUKAS "LUKE" MURPHY (30s), interrupts her.

LUKE
Doc, I've run the simulations. If we push the reactor to its limits... there's a 37% chance it'll collapse on itself.

JASON
(leaning in, speaking low)
You know, Tyler, I've been thinking. It's time for me to face my past.

TYLER
(nervously chuckling)
Oh boy, here we go again.

JASON
(serious)
No, listen. I've got some family secrets that need exposing. And I'm not just talking about the time my dad burned down the garage by accident.

Tyler raises an eyebrow.

TYLER
(teasingly)
What's really going on, Jason?

Jason glances around the pub, making sure no one is listening.

JASON
(leaning in closer)
It's about my mom. She died when I was a kid... but there were rumors that it wasn't just a car accident.

Tyler's expression turns serious.

TYLER
(low)
What kind of rumors?

Jason takes a deep breath before speaking.

JASON
(hesitant)
That she might have been murdered by my own family.

TYLER
(outraged)
That's not right, Jason. Your family can't have...

JASON
(interrupting)
Done it? That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out.

Tyler places a hand on Jason's shoulder.

TYLER
(firmly)
You know I'll support you no matter what.

The camera pans over a quiet suburban street, showing rows of small houses and neatly manicured lawns. We see JEN (28), a harried but lovable young woman, walking down the sidewalk with her two kids in tow.

JEN
(exasperated)
Okay, okay, let's get this out of the way. Who wants pancakes?

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - SUNDAY MORNING

Jen starts scrambling eggs while Mikey and Emily bicker over who gets to sit in their favorite chair at the kitchen table.

MIKEY
(grabbing a stool to try and get closer to the counter)
Mom, can I help with the pancakes?

JEN
(smiling)
You can stir the batter. But don't get any on yourself.

Emily begins whining and Mikey intervenes.

EMILY
(pouting)
I wanna help too!

MIKEY
(calmly)
Okay, you can do the syrup, Emily.

As Jen slides a plate of pancakes onto the table, there's a knock at the door. It's JEN'S NEIGHBOR, TOM (30), holding a six-pack of beer and a bouquet of flowers.

TOM
(smiling)
Sunday brunch is the best, isn't it? Thought I'd bring some supplies.

MIKEY
(persistently)
Tom, can I play Mario Kart?

(smiling)
You can try beating my high score.

As the game devolves into chaos, Jen intervenes, gently reminding everyone that it's almost time for a family nap.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - SUNDAY AFTERNOON

Jen lies down on her bed with Mikey and Emily snuggled up beside her. Tom enters with a cup of coffee and joins them.

TOM
(smiling)
You know, sometimes I think the best heroes are just people who show up every day and try their best.

JEN
(smiling back)
That's one way to look at it.

As they all settle in for a well-deserved rest, the camera pans out, showing the cozy suburban scene outside. The words "Ordinary Heroes" appear on screen as the episode fades to black.

What can I get you?

JACK
Just a whiskey. And some information.

BARKEEP
(leaning in)
You're lookin' for trouble, ain't ya? Name's Jack McCord, right?

JACK
(smirking)
How did you know?
