Write a script for the single episode of a Crime streaming series. The title of the series is `Vengeful`.<start>**Episode 1: "New Blood"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a dimly lit, rain-soaked Los Angeles streetscape before zooming in on our protagonist, JESSICA (30s), a determined and resourceful young woman with a troubled past.

Jessica is a former cop who was kicked off the force for violating department protocols. We see flashbacks of her being chewed out by her captain, her personal life beginning to unravel, and her decision to strike out on her own as a private investigator.

Cut back to present day. Jessica's sitting in her cramped office, sipping coffee and staring at a photo of her younger brother, MIKE (20s), who was murdered 10 years ago. The police never caught the killer, and the case remains open.

**Act II:**

Jessica receives an unexpected visit from a mysterious woman named SARAH (30s). Sarah claims to be Mike's former fiancée and has new information about his murder. She wants Jessica to investigate further, hinting that there's more to Mike's death than initially thought.

As they discuss the case, Jessica becomes increasingly intrigued and conflicted. Her personal stake in solving Mike's murder is clear, but she's also motivated by a desire for justice and vindication from her past mistakes.

Sarah leaves Jessica with a cryptic message: "Look into Tom Harris." We see a series of shots showcasing Tom's shady past as a small-time crook and his possible connections to the crime.

**Act III:**

Jessica dives head-first into the investigation, scouring old records and interviewing people from Mike's past. She encounters a cast of characters, each with their own secrets and motives:

* TONY (40s), an elderly neighbor who seems overly friendly but might be hiding something.
* KAREN (30s), Mike's best friend, who's now working as a bartender and has her own demons.
* Officer JENKINS (50s), Jessica's former colleague, who offers some hesitant advice.

Throughout Act III, we're presented with fragmented clues and red herrings, keeping the audience guessing about what really happened to Mike. As Jessica gets closer to the truth, she begins to face her own personal fears and doubts about her decision to leave the police force.

**Act IV:**

As night falls over LA, Jessica pieces together a timeline of events that point to Tom Harris as the prime suspect in Mike's murder. She confronts him at his seedy nightclub, but he seems to have anticipated her move.

Tom takes Jessica on a wild goose chase through the city, hinting at deeper conspiracies and powerful players involved in Mike's death. As they navigate the rain-soaked streets, Jessica starts to realize that she's not alone in this fight for justice.

The episode ends with a cliffhanger: Jessica staring down Tom as he hands her a small package containing a cryptic message - "You're next."

Fade to black.

EXT. NEW ASHWOOD - NIGHT

The cityscape stretches out before us, a maze of towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. But amidst the hustle and bustle, something's not quite right.

CUT TO:

INT. SPECTRAL JUSTICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

We see JASON "SPECTRUM" WYNTER (28), a brooding hero with a penchant for justice and a mysterious past. He's surrounded by his team: DR. EMILY PATEL (29), a brilliant scientist with a passion for the paranormal; TOMMY "SPHERE" KWAN (25), a tech-savvy genius with a flair for the dramatic; and MARCUS "MORPHEUS" JENKINS (32), a former soldier turned spectral warrior.

SPECTRUM
(focused on his phone)
Alright, team. We've got a situation downtown. Reports of ghostly apparitions causing chaos in the city's financial district.

EMILY
(consulting her notes)
I'm running some readings... Ah, yes! The energy signature is consistent with a Class-3 specter.

TOMMY
(excitedly)
Whoa, that means it's gotta be something big!

MORPHEUS
(skeptically)
Or just a bunch of amateur hackers trying to scare people off.

SPECTRUM
(grimly)
We'll see about that. Let's gear up and get moving.

CUT TO:

EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT

The team springs into action, their gear at the ready as they descend upon the chaos-filled streets. SPECTRUM charges forward, his spectral powers glowing with an otherworldly light.

As they battle the ghostly entities, it becomes clear that something's amiss. These aren't your average Class-3 specters... They're stronger, faster, and seemingly more intelligent.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

We see our heroes cornered by the mysterious entity. SPECTRUM attempts to reason with it, but it's just a ghost – or so he thinks.

ENTITY
(a voice like thunder)
You're not here to save anyone, SPECTRUM. You're just a pawn in a much larger game.

SPECTRUM
(firmly)
I don't know what you're talking about...

ENTITY

Oh, but I think you do.

Suddenly, the entity vanishes, leaving our heroes stunned and confused.

The team regroups, trying to make sense of what just happened.

EMILY
(baffled)
This doesn't add up. The energy signature was... different. Not like anything I've ever seen before...

TOMMY
(uneasy)
Guys? We need to talk about this whole "larger game" thing.

MORPHEUS
(skeptically)
Sounds like someone's trying to stir the pot, if you ask me.

SPECTRUM
(grimly)
Whatever it is, we'll get to the bottom of it. Spectral Justice will not rest until justice is served.

That's what I'm worried about. What if he does?

CUT TO:

We see a young man, JASPER FOTHERGILL (20s), a clever and ambitious page who has caught the eye of the princess. He is writing in a book as King Edward enters.

JASPER FOTHERGILL
(startled)
Writing some notes for Lord Finley, Your Majesty.

KING EDWARD SEATON
(skeptical)
And what do they say?

Jasper hesitates before speaking:

JASPER FOTHERGILL
It says... "The crown is heavy with the weight of a hundred wars and a thousand betrayals."

King Edward looks at Jasper with interest, but also with wariness.

SARAH

Need some help?

As she enters the café, she's stopped by a charming stranger, MAX (29), who accidentally bumps into her.

Max: Oh no, I'm so sorry about that. Are you okay?

Jessica: (laughing) Yeah, I'm fine. Just in a hurry.

ELYRIA

The darkness returns. A great and terrible power stirs in the depths...

Within the heart of Moonfall's great library lies an ancient relic: the Astral Sphere. An orb of pure light glows within a delicate crystal lattice, pulsing with otherworldly power.

(whispering to Arin)
The prophecy speaks of a celestial key... a secret hidden in plain sight...

ARIN
(teasing her playfully)
You think the answer lies within this relic?

ELYRIA
(skeptical)
Perhaps. The Oracle's words were cryptic, but they hinted at an ancient knowledge hidden here.

As Elyria reaches out to touch the Astral Sphere, it begins to glow brighter, releasing a resonant hum that sends shivers through the air. Suddenly, visions burst forth before her mind's eye: realms of shadow and light; forgotten civilizations; the threads of destiny weaving together in an intricate dance.

Dude, what's going on? You've been preparing for weeks and still can't get it together?

MAX POWER
 Ah, yeah! I'm just fine-tuning my origin story, Tina. You know, the whole "before I became Super Max" thing.

TINA
(sarcastically)
Oh boy, this should be good.

MAX POWER
(nervously) Okay, so... after a freak accident involving a lightning strike and a can of hairspray, I gained the power to...

MAX POWER's phone rings. He answers it.

MAX POWER
(into phone) Ah, yeah! What's up, Captain Amazing?

CAPTAIN AMAZING (V.O.)
Max Power, we need you to join the superhero community ASAP. We've got a supervillain on the loose.

MAX POWER
(excitedly)
Whoa, what's going down? Give me details!

CAPTAIN AMAZING (V.O.)
Negative, Max. Just get here. We'll brief you later.

Max Power looks at Tina, who shrugs.

EXT. CITY - DAY

The team of would-be superheroes, known as the "Super Zeroes," gather in front of a skyscraper. They include:

* MAX POWER (leader)
* TINA (tech expert)
* BUBBLES (a lovable but annoyingly cheerful guy with soap bubble powers)
* ZAP (a tech-savvy teenager who can't quite control his electricity powers)

MAX POWER
Alright, team! We've got a supervillain to catch!

TINA
(skeptical)
And how exactly do we plan on catching him?

MAX POWER
(casually) Oh, I've got a genius plan. We'll split up and cover the whole city.

ZAP
(eagerly)
Yeah! And I can just... Zap... him into submission!

BUBBLES
(excitedly)
And I'll make it easy by creating bubbles that distract him while you two take care of business!

The team begins to disperse, with Max Power and Tina heading off in one direction.

CUT TO:

INT. MAX POWER'S APARTMENT - LATER

Max Power and Tina return, looking dejected.

TINA
(sighing)
Well... That didn't go so well, did it?

MAX POWER
(sheepishly)
Yeah... I guess my plan needed a bit more... um, power.

Suddenly, the doorbell rings. It's CAPTAIN AMAZING.

CAPTAIN AMAZING
Sorry to interrupt, guys. We've got some news about the supervillain...

Max Power and Tina exchange worried glances as Captain Amazing continues to speak.

EMILY
Your Majesty, it is an honor to be here.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
(skeptical)
And what brings you before me today?

EMILY
(hesitant)
I... I seek your favor. My family has served yours for generations, but we've fallen on hard times. I came seeking a position in your court, that I may serve you and restore our honor.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
(impressed)
Ah, a lady of wit and ambition. I like that. What makes you think you're qualified to serve me?

EMILY
(confidently)
Your Majesty, I've studied the games of diplomacy and strategy under the great Lord Burghley himself. I'd be honored to bring my knowledge to your court.

QUEEN ELIZABETH
(intrigued)
Lord Burghley, you say? That's no small feat. Very well, I shall grant you an audience... but only as a pawn in this game of kings and queens.

Emily enters Lord Burghley's chambers, where she meets the aged statesman.

LORD BURGHLEY

Ah, Emily! I hear you've caught the Queen's eye. You're quite the rising star in our little game of politics.

EMILY
(respectfully)
Thank you, my lord. But tell me... what is it that Your Majesty sees in me?

LORD BURGHLEY
(serious)
Elizabeth sees an opportunity to use you as a pawn in her larger strategy against Spain and the Catholic Church. You're to be a player in this grand game of cat-and-mouse.

CUT TO:

Emily walks through the streets, lost in thought. She encounters a hooded figure who hands her a note with cryptic instructions:

Emily returns to court, now armed with a newfound determination and understanding of the stakes.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

JASON (30s), a lovable but slightly awkward guy, walks into the room, wearing a bright yellow "Intern" t-shirt.

JASON: (excitedly) Hey everyone! I'm Jason, your new intern!

The office falls silent as all eyes turn to Jason. The rest of the team looks like they've seen better days - think sweatpants and stained coffee cups.

SARAH (20s), a peppy young woman with a permanent grin, steps forward.

SARAH: Welcome, Jason! We're all really excited to have you on board...or at least, we were until we found out you had to work for free.

JASON: (nervously chuckling) Yeah, about that...I heard it was a great opportunity to learn and gain experience?

The team looks at each other in unison, rolling their eyes.

JEN (20s), a sarcastic-looking young woman with bright pink hair, speaks up.

JEN: That's right! And by "great opportunity," you mean we get to pay you nothing while you do all our work.

The team bursts out laughing. Jason awkwardly joins in.

Jason collapses onto his bed, exhausted from his first day of internship.

JASON: (to himself) Okay, okay...I get it. I'm the intern. I do all the work for free.

MIKE: Hey man! How's the internship? Is it as soul-sucking as we thought?

JASON: (laughing) Yeah, pretty much. But hey, at least I get to wear this sweet yellow t-shirt every day!

CUT TO:

INT. STARTUP OFFICE - DAY

The team is in a meeting, trying to brainstorm ideas for their next big project.

SARAH: Alright, so we've got the marketing campaign nailed down...

JEN: And the social media strategy is looking solid...

Suddenly, Jason interrupts with an awkward silence.

JASON: Uh, I was thinking... maybe we could also try... selling some stuff online?

The team looks at each other in confusion.

SARAH: Um, isn't that like a normal thing for a startup to do?

JEN: (sarcastically) Oh yeah, because nothing says "innovation" like selling things on the internet.

JASON: (sheepishly) Well, I just thought it was worth trying...

The team starts laughing again, this time at Jason's expense. But despite their initial skepticism, they start to get excited about his silly idea.

We see JACK (30s), a former special forces operative turned mercenary, crawling through the dusty lab on his belly. He's equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth suit and carries an assault rifle. Jack spots a small keypad on the wall and quickly hacks into it.

JACK

Alright, I knew they wouldn't get rid of everything.

Jack enters a password and waits for the computer to come online. Suddenly, the lab is filled with light as monitors flicker back to life.

CUT TO:

COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

A scrolling feed appears on the screen, listing classified information. Jack reads through it quickly, his eyes widening as he finds what he's looking for.

JACK
(to himself)
Darkstar Initiative? Never heard of it.

Suddenly, a holographic display flickers to life in front of Jack, projecting an image of DR. ELSA BLOOM (40s), a brilliant scientist with a fierce determination etched on her face.

DR. BLOOM
(voiceover, hologram)
Welcome, Agent. I'm afraid we've been compromised. Our research has... progressed beyond containment. The results were too extreme to reveal in the public domain, so we activated Protocol-7: Darkstar Initiative.

Jack looks stunned as Dr. Bloom explains that she was part of a top-secret government program developing advanced biotechnology and AI-powered systems. However, something went catastrophically wrong during the testing phase, unleashing an unknown entity with catastrophic potential.

CUT TO:

As she walks, we hear the sounds of horses' hooves on cobblestone streets. A horse-drawn carriage approaches. Inside is JOHANN GOTTLIEB FICHELTE (40), a prominent politician and friend of Anna's family.

Anna quickens her pace to intercept the carriage.

ANNA:
(hurriedly)
Johann, I need to speak with you. It's urgent.

FICHELTE:
(surprised to see her)
Anna! What brings you out today?

ANNA:

I've come from a meeting with some... associates. They're discussing the growing unrest among the people.

Ficelté nods thoughtfully, taking in Anna's words as they walk together.

Anna and Johann sit at his desk, surrounded by books and papers. He pours her a cup of coffee from a small pot on the corner of the room.

ANNA:
(urgently)
You know as well as I do, Johann, that the people are growing restless. The British occupation is suffocating our economy, and we're running out of food.

FICHELTE:
(skeptical)
Yes, yes... but what's to be done? We have no military power to speak of.

ANNA:
(confidently)
Exactly! That's why I believe it's time for us to take a stand. To rise up against the British and demand our rights as Danes.

Ficelté raises an eyebrow, intrigued by her passion.

Anna meets with a group of men, all dressed in simple but practical clothing. They huddle around a candle-lit table, discussing strategy.

Anna, we know you're part of the upper class, but you've shown us time and again that your heart beats for the people. We want you on board with our plans.

Ma'am, this is Captain Ortega. We're experiencing difficulties with our re-entry into orbit. Our propulsion system is malfunctioning.

Try to compensate with auxiliary engines. I don't want any... unpleasantness.

Captain Ortega's voice comes through the comms link, tense and strained.

CAPTAIN ORTEGA (V.O.)

Alright, stay sharp. We don't know what's down here.

As they move deeper into the caves, the air grows thick with an otherworldly energy. The explorers' equipment begins to malfunction, and strange noises echo through the tunnels.

You shouldn't be here. This place... it's not meant for humans.

JAX
(intrigued)
What do you mean? What is this place?

ARKEA

I've studied the ancient texts. This is a nexus point, where the fabric of reality is thin. You're close to... something.

The explorers exchange uneasy glances as Arkea leads them further into the depths of the caves.

Roger that, Phoenix. I'm on it.

As Jack approaches the extraction point, a group of heavily armed mercenaries, led by the ruthless and cunning VEGA (40s), emerge from the surrounding hills.

KAEL
(whispering to himself)
Time to get out of here...

Suddenly, he freezes, looking around cautiously. He spots something on the ground, picks it up, and examines it carefully. It's a small, intricately carved wooden box with a Nightshade symbol etched onto its lid.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED CABIN - NIGHT

Kael enters a musty, dimly lit cabin, the air thick with the scent of decay. He approaches a makeshift altar in the center of the room, where a hooded figure, LYRA (20s), sits cross-legged on a worn fur rug.

LYRA
(her voice barely above a whisper)
You're late, Kael. The Shadowhand is closing in...

KAEL

What have you found?

Lyra gestures to a large, leather-bound book lying open on a nearby pedestal. The pages are filled with cryptic symbols and illustrations of nightmarish creatures.

LYRA
(concerned)
This is the Nightshade Codex... It's said to hold the secrets of our order...

Okay, we've got our first case. A high-profile businessman named Richard Langley has gone missing. His assistant reported him missing when he didn't show up to work this morning.

TOM
(skeptical)
Langley? The one who owns half the city's real estate?

JESS
(nodding)
The same. I've already spoken to his assistant, but she seemed shaken and didn't give me much to go on.

Tom nods and starts searching through files as Jess begins to question him.

TOM
(grinning mischievously)
Well, let's get one thing straight: Langley was a piece of work. Had more enemies than friends in this city.

Jess raises an eyebrow.

JESS
(intrigued)
Tell me more.

Tom leans back in his chair and begins to spin a tale.

TOM
(laughing)
Okay, so you know how Langley made his fortune buying up old buildings? Well, it turns out he had some... "friends" who helped him acquire those properties. The kind of friends you only get when you're willing to bend the law a little.

Jess looks at Tom with curiosity.

JESS
(whispering)
What's this have to do with Langley?

Beats me, but it sounds like our boy was involved in some shady dealings. Maybe someone didn't want him around anymore...

JESS
(gently)
Help him what?

Sarah glances nervously around the room before speaking in hushed tones.

SARAH
(terrified)
He was investigating something big. Something that could ruin his reputation and destroy his business empire. He asked me to dig up some dirt on a company called "Haven Industries"... but I never got the chance...

Alright, let's review the plan. We've got 30 minutes to initiate the experiment before we risk destabilizing the entire station.

ENGINEER JASON TAYLOR (late 20s)
Yes, ma'am! I've uploaded the new algorithms and run a final systems check. Everything looks green.

SOFIA
(nodding)
Good. Dr. Zhang, can you walk me through the theoretical implications of this experiment?

DR. ZHANG (30s)
Of course, Sofia. We're attempting to create a micro-wormhole using quantum entanglement and gravitational waves. If successful, it could revolutionize our understanding of space-time.

The team nods, taking notes as Dr. Zhang explains the science behind the experiment.

CUT TO:

INT. ARKON SPACE STATION - EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY

The team begins to set up the equipment for the experiment. They're a flurry of activity, each member focused on their specific task.

SOFIA
(into comms device)
Alright, crew. Let's get this done. Jason, initiate the quantum generator sequence.

JASON
( nodding)
Roger that, Sofia.

The team holds its collective breath as the experiment comes online. The room begins to glow with a soft blue light.

CUT TO:

INT. ARKON SPACE STATION - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Sofia and her team watch from the control room as the data streams in on the holographic display.

SOFIA
(eyes fixed on the screen)
It's working... It's actually working!

The team erupts into cheers, hugging each other. Sofia grins, a mix of excitement and trepidation on her face.

CUT TO:

INT. ARKON SPACE STATION - EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY

As the experiment reaches its climax, a blindingly bright light fills the chamber. The team stumbles back, shielding their eyes.

Suddenly, a being materializes before them. It's humanoid in shape but with skin that shifts and shimmers like liquid silver. Its eyes burn with an otherworldly energy.

The being speaks in a language they can't understand, but somehow, they comprehend the message.

BEING
(in telepathic voice)
I am Kaelin. I am... (pausing) ...Awakened.

Sofia and her team stare at each other in awe as Kaelin's words hang in the air like a promise of revolution.

Write a script for the single episode of a Comedy streaming series. The title of the series is `Laugh Track Frenzy`.<start>**Episode 1: "The Great Pizza Debate"**

FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see a small, quirky coffee shop filled with eccentric characters. We focus on our main characters, JASON (30s), a struggling comedian trying to make it big; SARAH (20s), his free-spirited sister and manager of the coffee shop; and MAX (40s), a gruff but lovable regular who always has an opinion.

JASON: (excitedly) Okay, okay! I'm telling you, Max. Pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity!

MAX: (defensively) What are you talking about? It's the best topping for pizza!

SARAH: (interrupting) Oh, no, guys! We don't have time for this debate today. I have to get ready for the lunch rush.

JASON: (persistent) No way, sis! This is important. Max and I are going to settle this once and for all.

MAX: (smirking) Bring it on, kid.

Cut to:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

The debate has attracted a crowd of coffee shop patrons, who are now divided into pro-pineapple and anti-pineapple factions. Jason and Max take turns making their arguments, with the other patrons chiming in.

JASON: (passionately) Think about it, folks! Pineapple on pizza is like putting ketchup on a steak. It's just wrong!

MAX: (equally passionate) That's ridiculous! Pineapple adds a sweetness that balances out the savory flavors of the cheese and sauce!

As the debate rages on, things start to get heated. Sarah tries to intervene, but it only makes things worse.

SARAH: (exasperated) Okay, okay! Can we please just agree to disagree?

JASON: (defiantly) No way, sis! This is a matter of great importance!

MAX: (matching Jason's tone) Yeah, and I'm not backing down!

Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks their eccentric neighbor, LUCY (60s).

LUCY: (excitedly) Oh, oh! I couldn't help but overhear your debate. You know what? I have a solution.

JASON: (curious) What is it?

LUCY: (proudly) Pineapple on pizza... with peanut butter!

The room falls silent as the patrons stare at Lucy in confusion.

MAX: (horrified) What are you talking about, woman?!

LUCY: (defensively) I'm telling you! It's a game-changer. The creamy texture of the peanut butter pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the pineapple.

As the debate reaches its climax, Jason and Max storm out of the coffee shop, still arguing. Sarah rolls her eyes and shakes her head.

SARAH: (sighing) Just another day at Laugh Track Frenzy...

FADE OUT.

**THE END**<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Science Fiction streaming series. The title of the series is `Celestial Horizon`.<start>**Episode Title: "Echoes of Elyria"**

**Act I:**

FADE IN:

EXT. CELESTIAL HORIZON - SPACE STATION - DAY

We see a vast, orbiting space station, the Celestial Horizon, with the Earth visible in the background.

CUT TO:

INT. CELESTIAL HORIZON - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Commander SOFIA RODRIGUEZ (35), a no-nonsense and intelligent leader, stands before a holographic display projecting data on various celestial bodies.

SOFIA
(to her team)
Alright, we've received a distress signal from the research vessel, Elysium's Hope. They're reporting strange energy readings emanating from the planet Elyria.

JAX (28), Sofia's trusted first officer and friend since childhood, speaks up.

JAX
Commander, Elyria is supposed to be uninhabitable. What could be causing these readings?

SOFIA
That's exactly what we're going to find out. Assemble a team and prep the shuttle for launch.

CUT TO:

INT. CELESTIAL HORIZON - QUARTERS - DAY

We see JAX, in his quarters, staring at an old holographic video message from his father, who died on a mission to Elyria when Jax was just a boy.

JAX
(whispering)
Dad... I'm sorry. I should've listened...

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

EXT. CELESTIAL HORIZON - SHUTTLE BAY - DAY

Sofia, Jax, and their team board the shuttle, aptly named "Horizon's Edge".

JAX
(to Sofia)
You know as well as I do that Elyria was supposed to be a graveyard for our scientists. What makes you think this is different?

SOFIA
I don't have an answer yet, Jax. But my instincts tell me we're not going in blind.

CUT TO:

EXT. ELYRIA - SURFACE - DAY

The team descends onto the surface of Elyria in their shuttle. They are met with a strange, almost pulsating glow emanating from the ground.

JAX
(awed)
What is this?

SOFIA
We'll find out soon enough. Keep your eyes open for any signs of life or technology.

As they explore the planet's surface, strange visions and echoes of their past begin to surface in their minds.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

EXT. ELYRIA - DEEPER STRUCTURES - DAY

Sofia's team discovers an ancient structure that seems to be emitting the energy readings they detected earlier.

SOFIA
(whispering)
This is technology we've never seen before...

JAX
(firmly)
Whatever this is, it's not natural. We need to get out of here now.

But Sofia hesitates, her grip on reality starting to slip as she experiences visions from Elyria's past.

SOFIA
(smiling eerily)
You can hear it too, can't you, Jax? The whispers... the echoes...

JAX
(alarmed)
Sofia, snap out of it!

Suddenly, Sofia's eyes go blank, and she begins to speak in a voice that is not her own.

**Epilogue:**

CUT TO:

INT. CELESTIAL HORIZON - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The Celestial Horizon receives an ominous transmission from Elyria. The screen flickers with static before clearing to reveal a message etched into the surface of the planet itself.

"THE LINE BETWEEN MEMORY AND REALITY IS ABOUT TO BECOME VERY BLURRY."

FADE OUT.<end>
