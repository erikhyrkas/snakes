EXT. TOWN - DAY

We see a small, dusty town nestled in the heart of the American West. Horse-drawn wagons and riders mill about on the main street.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

We meet our hero, CASSIDY McKENZIE (40s), a ruggedly handsome bounty hunter with a mysterious past. He sits at a table, nursing a whiskey, as the patrons look on.

CASSIDY
(to the bartender)
Just whiskey, no small talk.

BARTENDER
(nervously)
Coming right up, Mr. McKenzie.

Suddenly, the swinging doors burst open and in walks JESSICA "HAWK" HARRISON (30s), a tough-as-nails sheriff's deputy from the next town over.

JESSICA
(firmly)
Cassidy McKenzie, I've been looking for you.

CASSIDY
(eyeing her warily)
What can I do for you, Deputy?

JESSICA
(pulling out a wanted poster)
You're wanted in Red Rock for murder. They say you killed a man named Victor LaGraine in self-defense... or so you claim.

Cassidy takes the poster and examines it with interest.

CASSIDY
(smirking)
Sounds like they got their facts straight, don't it?

JESSICA
(eyes narrowing)
You're not going to run from this one, McKenzie. You've got a reputation for being the best tracker in the West... and I aim to use that expertise to track down the real killer.

Cassidy's gaze lingers on Jessica, then he takes off his hat, revealing a thick shock of black hair.

CASSIDY
(leaning back)
Alright, Deputy. You've got my attention. What makes you think I'm not the one who killed LaGraine?

Jessica leans in close, her voice dropping to a whisper.

JESSICA
(slowly)
Because I saw him... LaGraine, that is... riding with a group of outlaws just days before his death. And I've got reason to believe he was involved in something big - something that got him killed.

Cassidy's eyes widen slightly at the news.

CASSIDY
(standing up)
Alright, Deputy. You've got my interest. Let's ride.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN - DAY

As Cassidy and Jessica prepare to leave, a mysterious figure watches from the shadows... Victor LaGraine's brother, VINCE (40s), with a vengeance burning in his eyes.

VINCE
(whispering)
This isn't over yet...

The camera pans out as Cassidy and Jessica ride off into the sunset, their adventure just beginning.

We see a bustling street in the heart of Paris, filled with people from all walks of life. We hear the sound of horse-drawn carriages and vendors calling out their wares.

CUT TO:

INT. A COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We see a young woman, LOUISE (25), sitting at a small table, sipping a cup of coffee. She's dressed in a simple but elegant dress, her hair styled neatly under a bonnet. Louise is deep in thought, staring out the window.

LOUISE
(whispering to herself)
What if it could be different? What if we didn't have to live in fear?

Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks a young man, MARIE (28). He's tall, with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes. Marie is a journalist, and he looks like he's been running for his life.

MARIE
(exhaling heavily)
Louise! Thank God I found you.

LOUISE
(concerned)
What's wrong? You look terrified.

MARIE
( glancing around the coffee shop nervously)
It's the Revolution. It's spreading fast. The people are demanding reform, and the monarchy is fighting back.

LOUISE
(amazed)
You mean... the Second Republic?

MARIE
(nodding)
Yes! And I have a source who wants to meet with us. He has information that could change everything.

CUT TO:

EXT. A SECRET MEETING SPOT - DAY

Marie leads Louise through the winding streets of Paris to a secret meeting spot. They arrive at an old windmill on the outskirts of town, where they're met by a mysterious figure, LÉON (30).

LÉON
(serious)
Welcome, Marie. I see you've brought Louise.

MARIE
(nervously)
This is... uh...

LOUISE
(smiling)
I'm Louise.

LEON
( nodding)
Ah, yes. You're the one who's been helping us with the pamphlets.

Louise looks surprised.

LOUISE
(amazed)
You mean... you know about that?

LÉON
(smirking)
Of course we do. We've been watching you, Louise. And I think it's time you knew the truth.

CUT TO:

INT. A HIDDEN ROOM - DAY

Leon leads them to a hidden room deep within the windmill. Inside, they find a small group of revolutionaries, all eager to join forces with Marie and Louise.

LEON
(passionately)
The people are rising up! We can't let them be silenced!

MARIE
(stepping forward)
What do we do? What's our plan?

LEON
(grinning)
We have a plan. And it starts now.

FADE TO BLACK.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

EXT. PARIS - DAY (1848)

The streets are filled with protesters, all demanding change. We see Marie and Louise at the front of the crowd, holding hands and smiling.

MARIE
(shouting)
Vive la République!

LOUISE
(whispering to Marie)
I never thought I'd be here. Fighting for something.

MARIE
(smiling)
You're not just fighting, Louise. You're fighting for a better future.

CUT TO:

INT. A ROYAL PALACE - DAY (1848)

The King of France looks on in horror as the revolutionaries storm the palace.

KING LOUIS PHILIPPE
(to his advisors)
This is madness! We must put an end to it!

His advisor, BARON VILLÉMEAU (40), shakes his head.

BARON VILLÉMEAU
(young and naive)
Your Majesty, perhaps we should listen to their demands. Maybe there's a way...

KING LOUIS PHILIPPE
(angrily)
Listen? To those rabble-rousers? Never!

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

EXT. PARIS - DAY (1848)

The revolutionaries have taken control of the city. Marie and Louise stand on a balcony, overlooking the sea of people below.

LOUISE

We did it, Marie! We changed history!

MARIE
(smiling)
We're not done yet, Louise. This is just the beginning.

CUT TO:

INT. A SECRET MEETING SPOT - DAY

Leon sits with Marie and Louise in a small, secret meeting spot. They discuss their next move.

LEON
(serious)
We have to be careful. The monarchy won't give up easily.

MARIE
(determined)
Don't worry, Leon. We'll take care of that.

Louise looks at them both, a fierce determination burning in her eyes.

LOUISE
(smiling)
And I'm right there with you two.

A lavish gala is underway. Guests mingle and admire the artwork on display. We see JESSICA TAYLOR (30s), a beautiful and poised art curator, as she greets guests and makes her way through the crowd.

JESSICA
(to a guest)
I'm so glad you could make it tonight! Our new exhibit is one of the most exciting shows we've had all year.

As Jessica continues to chat with the guest, the camera pans out to reveal a figure watching from across the room. This is LUCAS HARRIS (40s), a suave and charismatic art dealer.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jessica meets with her boss, MARK RYDER (50s).

MARK
Jessica, I know you're working hard on this exhibit, but we need to talk about the budget. We're coming up short, and I'm not sure if we can make it work.

JESSICA
(concerned)
Mark, I've been over the numbers with our team. We can make it work, but we'll have to get creative with some of the pieces.

MARK
(skeptical)
Creative? Jessica, this is an art gallery, not a charity. We need to make money.

CUT TO:

INT. PRESTON ART GALLERY - LATER

As the gala winds down, the guests depart, and the staff begins to clean up. Lucas Harris approaches Jessica, who's now standing near the exhibit of artwork.

LUCAS
(to Jessica)
You know, I couldn't help but notice how... enthusiastic you were about this exhibit tonight.

JESSICA
(nervously)
Oh? And why is that?

LUCAS
(smirking)
Because it's not all it seems. There are some... issues with the pieces in this show.

Jessica looks taken aback, unsure of what Lucas means.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCAS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Lucas meets with an associate, TOM (30s).

TOM
(to Lucas)
So you think Jessica knows something about the fake art?

LUCAS

I'm positive. She's too invested in this exhibit not to be involved somehow.

Jessica receives a mysterious package containing a small painting and a note with a single sentence: "Look closer."

INT. MAVECK'S REVENGE - DAY

We see CAPTAIN JAX (30s), a charismatic and confident leader, standing on the bridge of his ship alongside his co-pilot and friend, ZARA (20s). They're both dressed in sleek black flight suits with silver accents.

JAX
(grinning)
Alright, we're back. Time to lay low for a while and let things cool down.

ZARA
(skeptical)
You know that's not an option, Jax. The Empire is still hunting us.

JAX
(wryly)
Yeah, well, we'll just have to make some new friends then.

Suddenly, the ship's AI, S.A.R.A (Sophisticated Artificial Reasoning Algorithm), interrupts them.

S.A.R.A
Voiceover
Captain, I'm detecting an unidentified energy signature approaching our position. It appears to be a...

JAX
interrupting
Put it on screen, S.A.R.A.

The viewscreen flickers to life, showing a strange, swirling energy vortex heading straight for the Maverick's Revenge.

CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE - DAY

As the ship is engulfed by the energy vortex, the camera shows a jarring transition from the futuristic ship to a completely alien world. The ground beneath them is rocky and barren, with twisted, glowing plants and creatures unlike anything on Earth.

JAX
(amazed)
What in...?

ZARA
(awestruck)
This isn't possible.

S.A.R.A
Voiceover
Captain, I'm detecting an energy reading that suggests we've been transported to a parallel universe...

CUT TO:

EXT. ALIEN WORLD - DAY

As the Maverick's Revenge lands with a thud on this foreign soil, three aliens emerge from the swirling vortex. They're unlike anything Jax and Zara have ever seen before.

The leader of these aliens, an imposing figure named ARKEAN, approaches the Maverick's crew.

ARKEAN
(in a deep, resonant voice)
Welcome, travelers from another realm. We've been expecting you.

JAX
(suspiciously)
Expecting us? How did you know we were coming?

ARKEAN
(with a hint of menace)
The universe is a web, Captain Jax. And sometimes the threads are pulled by forces beyond our control.

As Arkean speaks, the camera pans out to reveal an ominous structure in the distance - a massive, twisted tower that seems to be the heart of this alien world.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL CAFÉ - DAY

We meet our protagonist, EMILY (28), sipping on a coffee and staring out at the ocean. She looks lost in thought.

EMILY (V.O.)
I've been running for so long, I forgot how to stop. After my grandmother passed away, I inherited her beachside bakery and café. It's time to come home and start over.

Emily takes a deep breath and exits the café.

CUT TO:

INT. BAKERY - DAY

We see Emily walking through the empty kitchen, looking around at the familiar sights of her childhood home. She starts cleaning and preparing for reopening the bakery.

EMILY (V.O.)
It's been three years since I left this town. Three years since my parents passed away in a car accident. I've been working as a freelance baker, but it's not the same as being your own boss.

As Emily works, we see flashbacks of her life with her grandmother and parents. We get a sense of who she was before and how much she loved this town.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Emily is walking along the beach, feeling the sand between her toes and the wind in her hair. She looks out at the ocean and takes a deep breath.

EMILY (V.O.)
I'm scared to stay, but I'm more scared to keep running.

Suddenly, Emily sees a figure in the distance. It's MAX (29), a handsome local fisherman who used to be friends with Emily when she was growing up. Max is now working as a sailing instructor and looks every bit the rugged beach boy.

MAX
Hey! Long time no see!

Emily smiles and they exchange awkward pleasantries. As they talk, we can see a spark of attraction between them.

EMILY (V.O.)
Maybe I'm not running from my past... maybe I'm running towards it. Towards new beginnings and second chances.

CUT TO:

INT. BAKERY - DAY

Emily is now surrounded by customers and staff as she reopens the bakery. There's a warm, cozy atmosphere and we see Emily smiling and laughing with her employees.

The city lights reflect off the wet pavement as a group of rough-looking men, led by TAKAHASHI (35), storm through the crowded streets.

TAKAHASHI
(yelling)
We need to get in and out. The package is supposed to be waiting for us at the old warehouse on 5th and Main.

The team bursts into the warehouse, guns drawn, only to find it abandoned except for a single figure standing at the back of the room.

TAKAHASHI
(sneering)
What's going on here? Where's our package?

The figure slowly turns to face them. It's a young woman, KATSU (22), dressed in a black jumpsuit and carrying an assault rifle.

KATSU
(calmly)
You're late. And you've brought unwanted attention.

With a swift kick, Katsu sends Takahashi flying across the room. The others quickly close in on her.

TAKAHASHI
(getting to his feet)
We were hired to retrieve... whatever was supposed to be here. And now we have your problem.

KATSU
(firing off a few shots at the walls, creating cover for herself)
You don't understand what's going on. This warehouse is a front. A distraction from something much bigger.

Suddenly, a team of heavily armed men, led by Tetsuya (40), bursts into the warehouse. It becomes clear that Katsu has been expecting them and has set up an ambush.

KATSU
(backing away)
Time to show you why they call me "Steel".

With a fierce cry, Katsuo unleashes a whirlwind of martial arts moves and gunfire, taking down several of Tetsuya's men. The battle rages on until only two fighters remain: Katsu and Takahashi.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Takahashi stands over the defeated bodies, his face cut up but still smirking.

TAKAHASHI
(to Katsuo)
You're one heck of a fighter, kid. But you're not going to stop us. We'll get what we came for, and if you get in our way...

Katsu appears behind him, knife in hand.

KATSU
(whispering)
No one gets out alive.

With swift precision, Katsuo dispatches Takahashi's team and then turns her attention to the smirking leader.

TAKAHASHI
(backing away)
You're a liability. We can't let you live.

Katsu swiftly disarms him and presses her knife against his throat.

Jessica is behind the counter, taking orders from customers. She's friendly and efficient, but you can sense a hint of sadness in her eyes.

JESSICA
(to a customer)
That'll be $5.50 please.

Customer hands over their money, and Jessica hands them their drink. As she's making change, she catches sight of a handsome stranger, MAX (30), walking into the café. He looks out of place among the locals.

MAX
(approaching the counter)
Hi, I'm looking for a cappuccino. Large please.

Jessica smiles and begins to make his drink.

JESSICA
(smiling)
I'll get that right out to you.

As she hands him his coffee, their fingers touch, and there's an awkward but undeniable spark between them.

MAX
(apologetically)
Sorry about that. I'm not exactly the morning person.

Jessica laughs and begins to clean up a spill on the counter.

JESSICA
(smiling)
I think you're doing just fine.

As they chat, we see flashbacks of Jessica's past. We see her with her ex-boyfriend, TOM, but it's clear that their relationship has ended. Tom is distant and cold towards Jessica.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK

Jessica and Tom are arguing. It's clear they've been together for a while, but the love has faded.

TOM
(frustrated)
I don't know why you're so upset. We're just having a break-up.

JESSICA
(tearfully)
A break-up? You mean like when people break up and then get back together? No. This is final.

Tom looks taken aback, but Jessica is resolute.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFÉ - DAY

Jessica finishes making Max's drink and hands it to him. As they chat, we see a connection forming between them. They talk about everything from their jobs to their hobbies.

MAX

So what brings you to this lovely town?

JESSICA
(sighing)
I needed a change of pace. I've been feeling stuck lately.

Max nods understandingly and takes a sip of his coffee.

Suddenly, his roommate, MIKE (30s), bursts into the room.

MIKE
Dude, I brought back some Chinese takeout. I knew you were hungry!

Jason looks horrified.

No, Mike! I was just about to start my "Get Fit" program.

Mike holds up a giant egg roll.

MIKE
Oh, it's part of the program!

Mike, you're not helping!

MIKE
What? I'm just trying to provide moral support!

CUT TO:

ALEXANDER

Evie, I've been analyzing the data from the Nexus Experiment. We can't ignore it anymore.

The Langley Estate? But that place has been locked up tight since...since Richard died. What's going on?

EMMA (V.O.)
I know, I was shocked too. Apparently, the executor of his estate is finally selling off some of the assets to settle Richard's debts.

Jessica's eyes light up with excitement.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jessica paces back and forth in her small apartment, pouring over a map of Willow Creek and researching the Langley Estate online.

Jessica visits wealthy collector, MR. JENKINS (55), at his estate. She examines a vintage watch, carefully taking notes.

JESSICA
(to Mr. Jenkins)
This is quite an interesting piece of history. I'll need to research it further to confirm its authenticity.

MR. JENKINS
(smiling)
I'm glad you're interested in the Langley Estate's contents. Perhaps we can discuss a possible partnership?

Jessica hesitates, unsure what to make of Mr. Jenkins' sudden interest in her work.

We see a sprawling mansion set back from the road. Jessica walks through the overgrown gardens and approaches the entrance.

Suddenly, she's startled by a figure standing in the shadows.

JESSICA
(alarmed)
Who are you?

The figure steps forward, revealing a beautiful woman named SOPHIA (30). She looks distraught.

SOPHIA
(desperate)
You have to help me. I need your expertise.

Jessica follows Sophia inside, where they begin to examine the estate's contents.

CUT TO:

INT. LANGLEY STUDY - NIGHT

As Jessica begins to assess the Langley family heirlooms, she discovers a mysterious safe hidden behind a bookshelf. She carefully opens it and finds a collection of cryptic letters and photographs within.

CUT TO:

INT. DREAMWALKER'S HIDEAWAY - DAY

We meet our protagonist, EIRA (28), a skilled dreamwalker who has mastered the art of navigating and manipulating the dreams of others. She lives in a small, intricately carved wooden hut on the outskirts of the Dreamscapes.

Eira, with striking features and an ethereal aura, is hunched over a glowing crystal orb that seems to be guiding her thoughts. Suddenly, she's jolted out of her reverie by a faint whispering in her mind.

EIRA

What is it? What do you want?

The whispering grows louder, and Eira's eyes snap open as she realizes the Dreamscapes are trying to communicate with her.

CUT TO:

EXT. DREAMSCAPE - DAY

As Eira steps out of her hut, the Dreamscapes erupt into chaos. A dark, amorphous presence begins to spread across the landscape, threatening to consume everything in its path. The land itself starts to twist and writhe, as if alive.

This isn't supposed to happen!

INT. DREAMWALKER'S HIDEAWAY - DAY

Eira rushes back inside, desperate to understand the cause of this catastrophe. She consults ancient texts and seeks guidance from the Dreamscapes' enigmatic inhabitants.

ARACHNE
(serious)
The dreamstealer has returned.

EIRA
(concerned)
What do you mean?

ARACHNE
 gravely)
Your sister, Lyra... she was the key to maintaining balance within the Dreamscapes. Her passing has left a void that threatens to destroy everything we've worked for.

CUT TO:

EXT. DREAMSCAPE - DAY

As Eira navigates the treacherous landscape, she encounters creatures born from humanity's darkest fears: twisted, nightmarish entities with razor-sharp claws and teeth. The Dreamstealer itself is a dark mirror reflection of Lyra, now consumed by an insatiable hunger for the very fabric of reality.

EIRA
(resolute)
I won't let you destroy this place... I'll find a way to stop you.

The camera pans up to reveal Eira standing at the edge of a great precipice. The Dreamstealer looms in the distance, as the very essence of the Dreamscapes begins to unravel around her...

MARSHAL MCCORD
(into phone)
I know it was a mistake, Bill. I'm doin' my best to make it right.

Suddenly, the door swings open and a young woman, EMILY (20s), enters the office. She's clearly distraught, her eyes red from crying.

EMILY
(sobbing)
Marshal McCord, please! You gotta help me!

MARSHAL MCCORD
(rising from his chair)
What is it, miss?

EMILY
(sniffling)
It's my brother... Billy. He was part of a gang that robbed the bank in Red Rock last month. They killed two men and hurt several more. The sheriff there said you'd help me get him outta jail.

MARSHAL MCCORD
(sympathetic, but firm)
I'm afraid I gotta advise you, Emily... Billy's got a price on his head. If we can't convince the governor to commute his sentence...

EMILY
(desperate)
But he didn't mean to hurt anyone! He was just trying to get by!

The Marshal's expression softens.

MARSHAL MCCORD
(resolute)
Alright, Emily. I'll do what I can.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON - DAY

Marshal McCord and Emily arrive at the prison where Billy is being held. They're met by the gruff WARDEN (50s), who's not happy to see them.

Emily? Is that...?

The Marshal nods.

MARSHAL MCCORD
(firm)
Your sister's here to take you home. But we gotta make a deal, Billy. You see this town in need of a fresh start? We can make that happen. All you gotta do is...

Billy looks at the Marshal warily, as Emily rushes into the yard, tears streaming down her face.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - DAY

The townsfolk gather to discuss Billy's fate. The Marshal makes a passionate plea for clemency, citing Billy's good character and his desire to make amends.

As the discussion reaches its climax, the WARDEN storms in, furious at being outmaneuvered by the Marshal.

WARDEN
(furious)
This is an outrage! He killed two men!

MARSHAL MCCORD
(calmly)
The law says otherwise, Warden. And I'm here to enforce it.

With a heavy heart, Billy is granted parole and allowed to leave with his sister.

CUT TO:

EXT. RAVEN'S PEAK - DAY

As the McCord brothers (the Marshal's younger brother is also present) watch Billy and Emily ride off into the sunset, the Marshal reflects on the day's events.

MARSHAL MCCORD

Jessica orders a coffee at the counter and strikes up a conversation with the charming barista, MAX (20s).

MAX
So, you're new here? What brings you to Raven's Peak?

JESSICA
(smirking)
Let's just say I'm trying to escape the city for a bit. Get away from the noise.

MAX
(teasingly)
Well, you've certainly come to the right place. We like to keep things quiet around here.

As they chat, Jessica notices an elderly man sitting at the counter, sipping his coffee and staring intently at her.

JESSICA

Who's that guy? He looks like he's got a secret or two up his sleeve.

MAX

Welcome back, team! I've got some news for you. The tech we recovered was from S.T.A.R. Labs. This rogue agent is connected to a much larger operation...and it's personal.

Jessica looks concerned as Ray hands her a folder.

We meet our hero, CAPTAIN ZARA (30s), a brilliant scientist and pilot with short, spiky hair and piercing green eyes. She's surrounded by holographic screens and control panels.

CAPTAIN ZARA
(to herself)
Okay, let's try this again. Plotting new course to Andromeda...

Suddenly, the ship is rocked violently by an unknown energy wave. Captain Zara stumbles, but quickly regains her composure.

CAPTAIN ZARA

The ship hurtles towards a stunning, shimmering planet at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.

CAPTAIN ZARA
(whispering to herself)
Something's not right...

As they approach the planet, we see a strange, pulsating energy field surrounding it. The ship is buffeted by powerful shockwaves.

Captain Zara frantically tries to stabilize the ship, but it's too late. A massive explosion rocks the vessel, sending Captain Zara flying across the cockpit.

When Captain Zara comes to, she finds herself in an unknown location, surrounded by strange, glowing energy constructs. She looks down at her body and sees that she has been transformed into a being of pure energy.

CAPTAIN ZARA (ENERGY FORM)
(confused and disoriented)
What's happening? What am I?

Suddenly, a figure materializes before her. It's ZEPHYR, an enigmatic ally with the ability to manipulate reality itself.

Write a script for the single episode of a Anthology streaming series. The title of the series is `Shattered Dreams`.<start>**Episode Title: "The Price of Perfection"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a sleek, modern cityscape before zooming in on a beautiful young woman, JESSICA (28), standing confidently in front of her high-end apartment building. She's dressed to the nines, with a designer handbag slung over her shoulder and a flawless smile plastered on her face.

JESSICA: (to herself) This is it. This is my moment. I've worked so hard for this.

As she enters her apartment, we see flashes of her successful life: a high-powered job at a fashion magazine, a loving boyfriend, and a stunning penthouse view. But beneath the surface, cracks are beginning to form in Jessica's seemingly perfect world.

**Act II:**

We cut to flashbacks of Jessica's childhood, where she was constantly belittled by her mother for not being good enough. Her mother's cruel words have left a lasting impact on Jessica's psyche, making her feel like she'll never be quite good enough.

As the present-day narrative unfolds, we see Jessica struggling with an increasingly crippling sense of inadequacy. Despite her outward success, she feels empty and unfulfilled. She starts to sabotage her relationships and career, unconsciously driven by a deep-seated fear that she's not truly deserving of happiness.

**Act III:**

As the tension builds, Jessica's grip on reality begins to slip. She becomes increasingly paranoid and isolated, pushing away friends and loved ones who try to help her. Her apartment, once a symbol of her success, now seems like a prison.

In a shocking twist, we learn that Jessica has been secretly taking antidepressants to cope with the pressure she's put on herself. The medication, however, has had an unexpected side effect: it's suppressing her true feelings and desires, causing her to lose touch with her authentic self.

**Act IV:**

As the episode reaches its climax, Jessica hits rock bottom. She has a breakdown in front of her boyfriend, revealing the darkest secrets she's kept hidden for so long. The confrontation sparks a chain reaction that leads to the unraveling of her carefully constructed facade.

In a poignant and devastating conclusion, Jessica is shown standing alone in her apartment, surrounded by the remnants of her shattered dreams. She looks up at the mirror, where we see a glimmer of the person she used to be – broken, but not yet defeated.

Fade to black.

JEN
It's been okay. Just trying to get through this morning rush.

LUCY
I feel you. I've been running on coffee fumes since 7am.
