EXT. TOMBSTONE - DAY

We see the dusty, sun-scorched streets of Tombstone, Arizona Territory, circa 1885. People bustle about, going about their daily business. We zoom in on a group of townsfolk gathered around a large wooden stage.

**CUT TO**

JASPER "HAWK" WILSON (played by John Wayne-esque actor), a ruggedly handsome and seasoned lawman, dismounts his horse and approaches the stage. Hawk is dressed in worn leather duster coat, boots, and a wide-brimmed hat.

HAWK:
(to the townsfolk)
I'm here to see Marshal Jim, if he's available.

TOWNSFOLK:
(in unison)
You must be the new sheriff we've been hearin' about!

CUT TO

INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Hawk enters a cramped and dimly lit office, where MARSHEL JIM (played by grizzled veteran actor), a battle-hardened lawman with a thick beard, sits behind his desk.

MARSHAL JIM:
Ah, Hawk Wilson! Welcome to Tombstone. I hear you're the new sheriff up at Red Rock.

HAWK:
That's right, Marshal Jim. My territory now. What can I do for you?

MARSHAL JIM:
Just makin' sure you know who's in charge around here. You see, we've had some trouble lately... cattle rustlin', and a certain group of outlaws known as the "Deadwood Gang" been causin' quite a ruckus.

HAWK:
(skeptical)
The Deadwood Gang? Sounds like a bunch of no-good varmints. What makes 'em so special?

MARSHAL JIM:
They're led by none other than Black Jack McCoy, a man with a reputation for bein' as ruthless as a snake in a rainstorm.

**CUT TO**

EXT. TOMBSONE - DAY

Hawk is approached by a local saloon owner, MAEVE (played by sultry actress), a beautiful and cunning woman with a hint of mischief in her eyes.

MAEVE:
Sheriff Wilson! I've heard you're lookin' to get acquainted with the townsfolk. Why don't we start with me? I can show you around... and maybe even introduce you to some people who might be willin' to share what they know about Black Jack McCoy?

HAWK:
(smirking)
Now that's an idea worth consid'rin'.

**CUT TO**

EXT. SALOON - DAY

Maeve leads Hawk into the local saloon, where he's immediately recognized by the patrons as the new sheriff in town. As they make their way through the crowd, Hawk notices a group of rough-lookin' men eyeing him with hostility.

MAEVE:
(whispering)
Those are some of Black Jack McCoy's boys. Don't you go gettin' any ideas about causin' trouble, Sheriff Wilson.

HAWK:
(grinning)
Trouble? Me? Don't you worry about me, Maeve... I've got a reputation for keepin' the peace.

Suddenly, the saloon doors burst open and Black Jack McCoy himself strides in, flanked by his gang. Hawk's eyes lock onto McCoy, and we can see the tension between them like electricity in the air.

**Act I:**

FADE IN:

EXT. EGYPTIAN DESERT - DAY

We see a sweeping expanse of sand dunes stretching out to the horizon. In the distance, we spot a figure trudging through the desert, clad in simple yet practical clothing. This is our protagonist, KHNUM (played by Rami Malek).

As Khnum walks, he narrates:

KHNUM (V.O)
I am but a humble scribe, tasked with chronicling the annals of my people. Yet, I have always felt an insatiable hunger to uncover secrets hidden beneath the sands.

Khnum approaches a cluster of rocks and discovers a ancient stone gateway hidden within the crevices.

KHNUM
(whispering)
Zerzura... they say it's here somewhere...

**Act II:**

INT. ZERZURA'S TEMPLE - DAY

Khnum cautiously enters an abandoned temple complex, his eyes scanning for any signs of danger or treasure. As he explores the crumbling structures, he stumbles upon intricate frescoes depicting a long-forgotten civilization.

KHNUM
(awed)
The gods themselves must have breathed life into these stones...

Suddenly, Khnum hears whispers echoing through the halls. He cautiously approaches an altar and discovers a cryptic text inscribed on a stone pedestal:

KHNUM
(reads from the inscription)
"In the shadow of the solar disk, where darkness converges with light... seek the balance between chaos and order."

Khnum's mind whirs as he ponders the meaning behind these enigmatic words.

**Act III:**

EXT. EGYPTIAN DESERT - DAY

As the sun dips below the horizon, Khnum sets out into the desert once more, driven by a newfound sense of purpose. He walks for hours, the inscription burning in his mind like a firebrand.

As night descends, Khnum arrives at an ancient, crumbling ziggurat (a stepped pyramid). The structure appears to be aligned with the stars above, and as he ascends its stairs, the whispers grow louder still.

Khnum reaches the summit just as the moon rises. Gazing up at the celestial canvas, a revelation strikes him:

KHNUM
(excitedly)
I see it! The balance between chaos and order!

Suddenly, a sandstorm erupts around Khnum, threatening to engulf him. He stumbles forward into the maelstrom, driven by an unseen force.

FADE TO BLACK.

**Closing shot:**

As the storm rages on, we see a fragment of parchment floating in the sands. The scroll reads:

KHNUM (V.O)
...and so begins my journey through the forgotten empires...

We see JEN, a frantic and desperate mother, pleading with OFFICER JENKINS (40s) to take her concerns seriously.

JEN
(10 years ago)
Emily wouldn't just leave like that. Something's happened to her.

OFFICER JENKINS
( patronizingly)
Ma'am, we've investigated this thoroughly. Emily likely ran away from home due to family issues. We can't keep wasting resources on a missing person case that's probably self-inflicted.

Jen is visibly shaken by the officer's dismissal.

CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Jen takes a long drag on her cigarette, eyes locked on Emily's Polaroids.

We see JEN'S NEIGHBOR, TOM (40s), a rugged outdoorsman, pull up in his truck.

Hey Jen, how's it going?

Tom, I need to ask you something. Do you remember anything unusual around the time Emily went missing?

TOM
(squinting)
Now that you mention it...I did see a strange truck driving down our road around then. It was a dark blue or black Ford, but I never thought much of it.

Jen's eyes light up with interest.

INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM - DAY

We meet our protagonist, Jenny (25), waking up to her alarm blaring in her ear. She stretches, yawns, and looks around her cluttered room. The camera lingers on a peculiar journal hidden under her bed.

Jenny gets dressed and starts her day by making breakfast while listening to an old vinyl record of Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone". Her phone buzzes with an unknown number calling; she hesitates before answering it.

JENNY
(hesitant)
Hello?

UNKNOWN VOICE
(urgently)
Jenny, I know you're trying to hide. But they're getting closer. You have to be careful.

Jenny's expression changes from curiosity to fear as the caller abruptly hangs up. She looks around her room nervously.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Jenny meets with her best friend, Emma (25), a quirky artist who always wears bright colors and a warm smile. Over coffee, they discuss their lives; Jenny mentions an impending visit from her estranged mother after years of absence.

What are you going to do? You can't ignore her forever.

Jenny's expression becomes troubled as she sips her coffee, hinting at unspoken issues between them.

**Act II:**

As the day unfolds, Jenny navigates through the town's bustling streets. The camera captures the beauty of nature and the sense of unease creeping into Jenny's thoughts.

INT. LOCAL LIBRARY - DAY

Jenny visits an old bookstore within the library to search for a book that might hold clues about her past. She meets the enigmatic librarian, Mr. Jenkins (60s), who seems more knowledgeable than he lets on.

You're looking for answers in all the wrong places, dear.

Jenny's confusion deepens as she leaves the library, unsure of what lies ahead.

**Act III:**

As night falls over the town, Jenny returns to her room, this time with determination etched on her face. She opens the journal hidden earlier and discovers cryptic messages written within its pages. A single sentence catches her eye:

"They're watching you."

Jenny looks up from the book, as if anticipating an unseen presence. The camera zooms out, capturing Jenny's world in a new light - one where shadows loom and secrets hide.

**Closing scene:**

The episode ends with a fade-to-black on Jenny sitting at her desk, surrounded by darkness, the journal still open but now blank. The sound of crickets takes over as we leave her world, leaving viewers wondering what unseen forces are at play in this small town where nothing seems as it is.

**Act I:**

(Opening shot of a small, mysterious shop in a bustling market. The sign above the door reads "Curios and Wonders".)

We see our protagonist, EMILY (28), a young artist with a curious gaze, entering the shop for the first time. She is immediately struck by the eclectic array of items on display.

Shopkeeper: (MR. FINLEY, 60s) Ah, welcome to my humble abode! I have just the thing for someone as...adventurous as yourself.

Emily: (nervously) Uh, I'm not sure what you mean.

Mr. Finley: (winking) Oh, come now! I can sense it in your aura. You're searching for something more, aren't you?

(As they browse the shelves, Emily's eyes land on a peculiar-looking locket.)

Emily: What's this? It looks like an antique...

Mr. Finley: Ah, yes! That's a rare find indeed. A locket with memories of its own.

Emily: Memories? You mean it has...stuck to it?

Mr. Finley: (laughs) Ah, more than that! This locket contains the essence of memories. The stories of those who have worn it before you.

(As Emily holds the locket, she begins to feel a strange connection to it.)

**Act II:**

(Cut to a series of fragmented flashbacks, showcasing various people and events connected to the locket.)

We see:

* A young couple's first kiss (1910)
* A father's promise to his daughter (1945)
* A group of friends' joyous laughter (1967)

Each scene is brief, yet intensely emotional. Emily is drawn into these memories, experiencing them as if she were there herself.

(As the flashbacks cease, Emily returns to the shop.)

Emily: This is...incredible! I feel like I've seen all these things before...

Mr. Finley: (nodding) You have indeed, my dear. The locket has shown you its secrets.

**Act III:**

(The story takes a darker turn as Emily becomes increasingly enthralled by the memories contained within the locket.)

Emily becomes obsessed with unlocking more memories, convinced that the locket holds the key to understanding her own past and desires.

(As Emily's fixation grows, she begins to lose touch with reality. She starts experiencing fragmented visions of events not her own.)

(The shop itself appears to shift and change around her, reflecting her growing instability.)

**Climax:**

(Mr. Finley's true intentions are revealed as he watches Emily succumb to the locket's power.)

Mr. Finley: (whispering) Ah, yes...it's all been worth it...

(The camera pans out as Emily disappears into a dreamlike world of memories and desires, trapped within the confines of her own mind.)

**Epilogue:**

(Emily awakens in a hospital bed, surrounded by concerned faces.)

Doctor: You were having some kind of episode. We had to sedate you.

Emily: (disoriented) What happened?

Mr. Finley's shop lies abandoned outside, its windows shattered and the sign ripped off its post.

(The camera zooms out further as Emily looks at her own hand, where she finds the locket clutched in a tight fist.)

INT. SMALL VILLAGE - DAY

We see a small village nestled in the heart of this idyllic landscape. People are going about their daily business, tending to their animals, gathering herbs, and chatting with one another.

We see a young woman, EIRA (25), with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes, walking through the village. She's dressed in simple but practical clothing for someone living off the land.

Eira stops at a small wooden stall where an elderly man, ELATH (60s), is selling food to the villagers. Elath looks up at Eira and nods respectfully.

ELATH
(to Eira)
Good morrow, child. What brings you to the village today?

EIRA
(smiling)
Just gathering some herbs for my mother's medicine. She's been feeling under the weather lately.

Elath nods sympathetically.

ELATH
(whispering)
Be careful out there, child. The forest can be treacherous this time of year.

Eira smiles and thanks Elath before continuing on her way.

CUT TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

We see Eira walking through the dense forest, gathering herbs as she goes. She's lost in thought, her mind elsewhere.

Suddenly, a loud noise echoes through the forest. Eira turns to see a massive tree branch has fallen across her path.

As she tries to move it, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's a mysterious woman, LIRIA (30s), with piercing blue eyes and shoulder-length silver hair. She's dressed in dark leather armor and carries a sword at her side.

Liria looks Eira up and down before speaking in a low, husky voice.

LIRIA
(to Eira)
You shouldn't be here. This isn't a safe place for you to be.

EIRA
(backing away)
Who are you? What do you want?

Liria shrugs and holsters her sword.

LIRIA
(leaning against the tree branch)
My name is Liria, child of the prophecy. And I've been searching for you.

Eira looks confused.

EIRA
(incredulous)
Prophecy? What are you talking about?

Liria smiles, and her eyes seem to gleam with an otherworldly intensity.

LIRIA
(serious)
You have something inside you, Eira. A power that only manifests in those chosen by the prophecy. And I'm here to guide you on your journey.

Eira looks unsure, but Liria's words resonate deep within her.

CUT TO:

EXT. WINDING RIVER - DAY

We see Eira walking along the riverbank, looking troubled and confused. She stops at a small, ancient stone pedestal that stands by the water. On top of the pedestal is an amulet - a shimmering, silver pendant in the shape of a crescent moon.

Eira touches the amulet with her fingers, feeling an inexplicable connection to it. The camera zooms out as Eira looks up at Liria, who's standing behind her.

Jessica's eyes are fixed on a photo of Ethan Ryder, her expression twisted in anguish. We see flashbacks of Jessica and Ethan together, happy and carefree.

JESSICA

You know, Lace, I've been thinkin'. We've been doin' this bounty huntin' thing for nigh on 10 years now. Time we took a break from all the runnin' and gunnin'.

LACE

You're thinkin' of leavin'?

JACK
(nodding)
Yeah, I am. Find some land, build a ranch... live a life without worryin' about gettin' our hides blown off by outlaws.

LACE

Jack, we can't just leave. We've got a reputation to uphold. People are startin' to depend on us for protection and justice in this territory.

You see this fella? Kid's got connections to some big-time outlaws. We can use this bounty to get us back on our feet financially.

JACK
(hesitant)
I ain't so sure, Lace. This Kid's a slippery one. I've heard tell of him takin' down whole posse units by himself...

LACE

That just makes me want to take him in even more.

Jack and Lace arrive at the local sheriff's office, where they meet with SHERIFF TOM (50s), a gruff but fair man who has a lot of respect for the bounty hunters.

FADE IN:

EXT. RIO GRANDE TOWN - DAY

We see a small, dusty town nestled along the Rio Grande River. People are milling about, going about their daily business.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

We see JAX McCORD (30s), a rugged and charismatic former outlaw, sitting at the bar with a whiskey in front of him. He's dressed in worn leather duster coat and a wide-brimmed hat.

JAX
(to the bartender)
What's the haps around here? I'm looking for work.

BARTENDER
(nervously)
Word is, we got us a new sheriff comin' to town. Name of Marshal Bill Tanner. He's supposed to be tough on outlaws and keep this place safe.

JAX
(leaning in)
Sounds like someone needs some... persuadin'.

CUT TO:

EXT. RIO GRANDE TOWN - DAY

We see MARSHAL BILL TANNER (40s), a no-nonsense lawman with a stern expression, riding into town on horseback. The townsfolk gather 'round to watch as he dismounts and begins to survey the area.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - LATER

Jax is sitting at a table, eyeing Marshal Tanner who's now inside the saloon. Jax looks up as Tanner approaches him.

MARSHAL TANNER
(sternly)
You're the one they call "The Kid". I've heard a lot about you.

JAX
(smirking)
Who hasn't? (he stands up)

MARSHAL TANNER
(eyes narrowing)
I'm here to tell you, kid, that Rio Grande Town's got a new sheriff. And it's not just a title - it's a job description. You start any trouble, and I'll be the one comin' after you.

JAX
(skeptical)
You're makin' me a lot of promises, Tanner.

MARSHAL TANNER
(firmly)
I'm makin' no promises, kid. Just warnings.

CUT TO:

EXT. RIO GRANDE TOWN - DAY

As the sun begins to set, Jax and Marshal Tanner have a showdown at high noon in front of the town's residents. But instead of drawin' their guns, they stare each other down... then nod at one another in understanding.

CUT TO:

INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - LATER

Jax is sitting across from Marshal Tanner, who's now sipping on a cup of coffee.

MARSHAL TANNER
(serious)
I know what you are, Jax McCord. And I'm not afraid to admit it. You're one of the best... outlaws this side of the Pecos River. But I'm willin' to give you a chance to make amends. Join me as my deputy, and help keep this town safe.

JAX
(nodding)
Alright, Marshal. I'll do it. For now, at least.

**Episode 1: "The Cuddle Conundrum"**

FADE IN:

INT. COZY LIVING ROOM - DAY

We see a group of friends, all in their mid-twenties to early thirties, lounging on a plush couch and various armchairs. There's JEN (25), the self-proclaimed leader of the group; MIKE (28), a charming but slightly awkward guy; SARAH (29), a Type-A personality with a love for organization; TOM (32), a lovable slacker; and EMILY (26), a free-spirited artist.

JEN
(yelling from across the room)
Okay, guys! Our first meeting of Cuddle Club is about to start!

The friends all look at each other excitedly as JEN holds up a clipboard with a silly logo on it.

MIKE
(whispering to SARAH)
What's the point of this again?

SARAH
(silently mouthing) "Cuddle Club" means cuddling, not just talking about cuddling. It's for people who need actual physical contact to feel happy and secure.

TOM
(laughing)
Sounds like a bunch of grown adults needing their mommies.

EMILY
(smiling)
Actually, it's really important for our emotional well-being. Trust me, I've done my research on snuggles.

JEN
(serious)
Okay, okay! Let's get started! Our first Cuddle Club exercise is... Group Hug!

The friends all awkwardly stand up and try to position themselves in a hug, but it quickly turns into a chaotic mess of arms and legs.

MIKE
(flailing his arms wildly)
I'm just not built for this! I'm like the human equivalent of a platypus trying to cuddle!

SARAH
(firmly holding her spot)
No one said you had to be good at it, Mike. Just try.

As they finally manage to form a somewhat cohesive group hug, EMILY starts to get carried away and begins to make silly snuggling noises, causing TOM to burst out laughing.

CUT TO:

INT. COZY LIVING ROOM - LATER

The friends are now sitting in a circle, trying to have a more traditional Cuddle Club discussion about their feelings and experiences with intimacy.

JEN
(listening intently)
So, Sarah, what's been the most intimate experience you've had recently?

SARAH
(thoughtfully)
Actually... it was when my cat, Mr. Whiskers, came onto my lap and started purring. It felt like he understood me on a deep level.

The friends all stare at her in confusion before bursting out laughing.

MIKE
(laughing)
Only you, Sarah!

CUT TO:

INT. COZY LIVING ROOM - FINAL SCENE

As the meeting wraps up and everyone starts to disperse, JEN approaches EMILY with a curious expression.

JEN
(smiling slyly)
Hey Emily? Can I ask you something?

EMILY
(innocently)
What's up?

JEN
(mischievously)
Want to cuddle after this meeting?

EMILY
(grinning)
Absolutely!

The two friends awkwardly make their way to the couch, where they both end up lying on top of each other in a silly, over-the-top snuggle position.

FADE OUT.<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Epic streaming series. The title of the series is `Fractured Skies`.<start>**Episode 1: "Rift"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape. The sky is a deep, foreboding grey, and the air is thick with an otherworldly energy.

We see a figure walking towards us - Kaelin Vex (30s), a rugged, battle-hardened survivor with a scar above her left eyebrow. She's dressed in tattered leather armor, and carries a massive crossbow on her back.

As she approaches, we hear the distant rumble of thunder. Suddenly, the sky splits apart, revealing a churning portal of swirling colors. Kaelin freezes, sensing the gravity of what she's seeing.

**Act II:**

Kaelin's eyes widen as a figure emerges from the portal - Arin Vex (40s), her estranged father and a legendary scientist who vanished years ago. He's dressed in a suit that seems to be absorbing the energy around him, and his eyes burn with an intense inner fire.

"Arin," Kaelin says, stunned. "What are you doing here?"

Arin approaches her, his expression grave. "Kaelin, I've come to warn you. The rifts in the sky... they're not natural. They're a sign of something much bigger - something that threatens to consume everything."

As they speak, strange creatures begin to emerge from the portal. They're humanoid, but their bodies seem to be shifting and flowing like liquid.

**Act III:**

Kaelin and Arin take cover behind a nearby rock outcropping as the creatures close in. Kaelin raises her crossbow, but Arin stops her.

"Wait," he says. "These aren't just mindless beasts. They're... altered humans. Experimented on by someone - or something."

As they watch, a figure emerges from the portal. He's tall, imposing, and his eyes burn with an otherworldly energy.

"This is it," Arin whispers. "This is what I've been searching for."

Kaelin looks at him, confused. "What do you mean?"

Arin glances at her, then back at the stranger. "I think... I think he's going to show us just how far we've fallen."

**Act IV:**

The figure approaches them - Erebus (30s), a charismatic and unsettling individual with eyes that seem to see right through Kaelin.

"Welcome, Kaelin," he says, his voice dripping with condescension. "I've been waiting for you. You're just in time to witness the dawn of a new era."

As Erebus speaks, the creatures close in around them. Kaelin raises her crossbow, but Arin stops her once more.

"Not yet," he whispers. "We need to know what's going on. What this rift is."

Erebus chuckles, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Ah... you want to play it safe? How quaint."

He snaps his fingers, and the creatures halt their advance.

"Very well," Erebus says. "I'll give you a choice: join me in shaping the future - or face the consequences of your ignorance."

Kaelin looks at Arin, who nods grimly. She takes a deep breath, then turns back to Erebus.

"I'm listening," she says.

The camera zooms out as Kaelin and Erebus lock eyes. The sky above them continues to shatter and reform, a manifestation of the cataclysmic forces that are about to reshape their world forever.

DETECTIVE JENNY WALKER
(fierce and confident)
Alright, here's what we know so far. Our victim is Emily Wilson, a 25-year-old journalist who was last seen leaving her office building in downtown LA.

DETECTIVE TOM HARRIS
(intelligent and analytical)
Jenny, can you tell me more about the crime scene?

WALKER
(nodding)
Emily's car was found abandoned on the outskirts of town with no signs of foul play. It wasn't until several hours later that her body was discovered in an alleyway near her apartment building.

DETECTIVE SARAH JENKINS
(skeptical)
There were no witnesses or surveillance footage?

WALKER
(shaking her head)
Nothing. It's like she vanished into thin air.

HARRIS
( scribbling notes)
Okay, let's break this down. We have a young journalist who was investigating some shady dealings...

DETECTIVE MIKE RODRIGUEZ

The team reconvenes to share their findings.

RODRIGUEZ

WALKER
(determined)
I'll take it from here. I've got a lead on a suspect.

The camera pans over the bustling streets of ancient Rome, before landing on our protagonist, LUCIUS (30s), a young and ambitious scribe. He's dressed in simple yet clean robes, with a quill pen tucked behind his ear.

LUCIUS
(to himself)
Today's the day I finally get to meet the great Senator CASSIUS. Maybe he'll take me under his wing...

CUT TO:

INT. SENATOR'S PALACE - DAY

Lucius stands nervously outside the senator's chambers, taking a deep breath before entering.

LUCIUS
Ah, Senator Cassius!

The senator, a portly man with a stern expression, looks up from the papers on his desk.

SENATOR CASSIUS
 Ah, Lucius. I've heard good things about your skills as a scribe. What brings you here today?

LUCIUS
(nervously)
I-I brought some scrolls to share with you, sir. News of the empire's latest victories and...

Cassius interrupts him, beckoning him closer.

SENATOR CASSIUS
 Ah, yes! I see you've included a mention of my own heroism in the wars against Parthia. (he chuckles) Modesty becomes you, Lucius.

As they chat, we notice a few peculiar details about Cassius's chambers: ancient artifacts on the shelves, and an intricately carved stone pedestal supporting...

CUT TO:

INT. SENATOR'S CHAMBERS - CLOSE UP

The camera focuses on the pedestal, where a worn-out scroll lies flat. The image is faint, but it appears to be some sort of map or chart.

LUCIUS
(intrigued)
What's that, sir? An ancient scroll?

SENATOR CASSIUS
(suddenly serious)
Ah, yes... This. (he takes the scroll from the pedestal and hands it to Lucius) Care for this one, Lucius. It holds some historical significance.

Lucius looks at the senator with curiosity as he takes the scroll.

LUCIUS
What kind of significance?

CASSIUS glances around nervously, before responding in hushed tones...

SENATOR CASSIUS
It's a lost chronicle... A record of events long forgotten. Some say it's cursed.

Lucius raises an eyebrow as Cassius leans in closer.

LUCIUS
(whispering)
Cursed? What do you mean?

As they continue to speak, we see strange shadows creeping across the walls...

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

Blackjack enters the local saloon, where a handful of townsfolk are gathered around the bar. He takes a seat next to JOSEPHINE "JOSIE" WALKER (30s), a beautiful and fiery saloon owner with a quick wit.

JOSIE
(smirking)
Well, well, well. Look what we got here. If it ain't Blackjack Murphy himself.

BLACKJACK
(smirking back)
Josie Walker. Still lookin' as pretty as ever. Though I reckon you're gettin' a mite too big for your britches these days.

The townsfolk snicker and whisper to each other, curious about the tension between Blackjack and Josie.

CUT TO:

EXT. DESPERADO'S DIVIDE - DAY

Blackjack and his companion, a grizzled old outlaw named HENRY (60s), meet with a group of local ranchers, led by a stern-looking ELIJAH WYATT (40s).

ELIJAH
(firmly)
We need your help, Blackjack. There's been a string of cattle rustlin's in these parts, and we suspect it's the work of a gang led by a notorious outlaw named JACK "THE KID" McCARTHY.

BLACKJACK
(intrigued)
Jack The Kid? I ain't heard from that scoundrel in years. What makes you think he's behind this?

HENRY
(skeptical)
Word is, Blackjack, Jack's got himself a score to settle with you. He's been lookin' for revenge ever since... well, since the incident at Red Rock.

Blackjack's expression darkens as memories flood his mind.

CUT TO:

EXT. DESPERADO'S DIVIDE - NIGHT

As night falls, Blackjack and Henry track down Jack The Kid and his gang to an abandoned mine on the outskirts of town. They find themselves face-to-face with Jack, a charming but deadly outlaw (30s) with a quick draw and a sharp tongue.

JACK
(smirking)
Well, well, well. Look who's been tracking me all this time. Blackjack Murphy himself. I reckon you're here for the same reason as everybody else: to get rich off our stolen cattle.

BLACKJACK
(calmly)
I'm not after your loot, Jack. I just want to put an end to whatever business it is you got goin' on here in these parts.

Jack and Blackjack engage in a tense standoff, each waiting for the other to make a move. Suddenly, Josie appears out of nowhere, her gun drawn and ready to take down Jack's gang.

JOSIE
(fiercely)
I reckon I got a stake in this too, Blackjack. My livestock's among those that went missin'.

Blackjack nods at Josie as he takes aim at Jack.

BLACKJACK
(resolute)
Time for you to ride off into the sunset, Jack. This here town don't need no trouble like yours around.

Jack smirks and gives a mock salute before turning tail and fleeing with his gang. Blackjack and Josie share a triumphant glance as Henry takes down several of Jack's henchmen.

CUT TO:

EXT. DESPERADO'S DIVIDE - DAY

As the dust settles, Blackjack turns to Josie with a hint of vulnerability in his eyes.

BLACKJACK
(hesitant)
Josie... I reckon there's somethin' we need to talk about. Something that's been weighin' heavy on my mind for years...

Josie raises an eyebrow as Blackjack's voice trails off, leaving the audience wondering what secrets he's keeping hidden beneath his tough exterior.

The patrons are rowdy and rough-lookin', but they fall silent as a figure rides into town on horseback, dismounts, and ties his steed to the hitching post outside.

This is our hero, JACK McCALL (30s), ruggedly handsome with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes. He wears a dusty hat and carries a holstered pistol at his side.

Jack walks into the saloon, scanning the room for anyone who might be looking for him. His eyes land on a grizzled old lawman named CAPTAIN JENKINS (50s), sipping a whiskey at the bar.

JACK
(holding up his hands in surrender)
Captain Jenkins! I'm lookin' for your help.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(evenly)
What can I do for you, kid?

JACK
(taking a seat next to him)
I got word that my brother, TOM, was killed by outlaws somewhere between here and Abilene. I aim to find 'em and bring 'em to justice.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(nodding thoughtfully)
You know the folks you're talkin' about? The Blackheart Gang?

JACK
(determined)
Yeah, that's the ones. Word is they've got a hideout somewhere in these here parts.

Captain Jenkins hands Jack a mug of whiskey and leans in close.

CAPTAIN JENKINS
(serious tone)
You be careful out there, boy. The Blackhearts ain't no joke. They'll cut you down faster than a rattlesnake on a hot summer day.

Who's the tall fella with the scar?

CAPTAIN JENKINS

That's Brother Elliot. He runs the Blackhearts.

Elliot gives Jack a cold, calculating stare before turning back to his crew.

We meet our protagonist, EILEAN, a young Scottish noblewoman in her early 20s. She is sitting with her father, KING DOMNALL, and their advisors, discussing the impending war with their rival kingdom to the east.

Evie, maybe it's just a glitch? We can try running the test again and—

EVELYN

No, no, no. I've been over this in my head a thousand times. There's something we're not considering.

Suddenly, Evelyn stops pacing and looks at Troy with an intensity that makes him take a step back.

EVELYN
(whispering)
What if the universe isn't fixed? What if it's... changing?

TROY
(skeptical)
You mean, like, in some kind of way we can see?

Yes. Exactly. I've been reading up on this parallax theory stuff, and I think it might be more than just a mathematical concept.

DAVE
(nervously)
Oh, just my famous three-alarm chili. I'm entering it into the annual Chili Cook-Off today.

SARAH
(skeptical)
The one where everyone gets food poisoning and then sues each other?

DAVE
(defensively)
Hey, my chili is a masterpiece! And I've got all the ingredients... except for the habanero peppers. I just realized I forgot to buy those.

SARAH
(dryly)
No habaneros? That's like making a pizza without cheese.

DAVE
(persistent)
I'll just use some hot sauce instead, it'll be fine!

CUT TO:

INT. CHILI COOK-OFF - DAY

Dave and Sarah arrive at the Chili Cook-Off, where they meet their friends and neighbors, TOM (38) and LUCY (30). Tom is a self-proclaimed chili connoisseur, while Lucy is a health-conscious yoga instructor.

TOM
(whispering to Dave)
Listen, buddy, I heard the judges are looking for something " bold" this year. You gotta bring your A-game if you want to win.

DAVE
(overhearing)
Don't worry, Tom, my chili has got some... um, personality.

CUT TO:

INT. JUDGING TABLE - DAY

The judges taste each entry, with varying reactions of disgust and amazement. Dave's chili is finally tasted, and the reaction is immediate.

JUDGE 1
(scrunching face)
Wow, that's... quite a flavor!

DAVE
(smiling confidently)
I told you it was good!

CUT TO:

EXT. CHILI COOK-OFF - DAY

As the results are announced, Dave's chili is... surprisingly... declared the winner! However, as the crowd erupts in cheers and applause, we see Tom clutching his stomach in agony.

TOM
(gasping for air)
What have you done to me?!

DAVE
(laughing triumphantly)
It was just a little something I like to call "the habanero substitute"!

CUT TO:

INT. YUKI'S APARTMENT - DAY

We meet our protagonist, YUKI (25), as she wakes up to the sound of her phone buzzing on her nightstand. She rubs the sleep from her eyes and checks the time - 7:00 AM. Her cat, Mochi, stretches beside her.

YUKI
(to Mochi)
Good morning! Today's a holiday... for some people, that is.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

Yuki walks into the convenience store where she works part-time with her friend and coworker, TAKESHI (25). They exchange warm smiles as they begin their routine tasks.

TAKEISHI
Hey, have you thought about what you're doing for Showa Day? I'm planning to take a day off.

YUKI
Actually... I was thinking of going to the shrine for Shubun no Hi. I've always wanted to watch the sun pass through the torii gates.

TAKEISHI
That sounds amazing! You should totally go!

CUT TO:

EXT. SHRINE - DAY

As Yuki walks through the shrine grounds, she comes across a group of schoolgirls celebrating Shubun no Hi (Summer Solstice). They're having a picnic and taking photos in front of the beautiful gardens.

YUKI
(excitedly)
This is perfect! I love watching the sun shine on these flowers.

CUT TO:

INT. YUKI'S APARTMENT - DAY

Later that day, Yuki returns home to make dinner for herself and Mochi. She puts on some music and starts cooking while chatting with her mom over the phone.

YUKI
Mom, I'm making your famous teriyaki chicken tonight!

MOM (V.O.)
Oh, I'm so proud of you! Don't forget to eat your vegetables.

YUKI
(laughs)
Of course not!

CUT TO:

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

As the sun sets, Yuki walks outside with Mochi and watches the stars come out. The sound of crickets fills the air as people in the neighborhood begin to light up their lanterns for Tanabata (Star Festival).

YUKI
(smiling)
This is my favorite time of day.

CUT TO:

INT. YUKI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Yuki settles into her cozy apartment, she takes a moment to reflect on the little joys in life. She looks around at the small treasures and mementos scattered about her home.

YUKI

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

We see DETECTIVE JENNY RYDER (40s) and her partner, SERGEANT TOM BRADSHAW (50s), sitting in the backseat, reviewing case files and notes.

JENNY
(frustrated)
We've been over this a thousand times, Tom. I still can't shake the feeling that we're missing something.

TOM
(calmly)
You want to find a killer who's gone to great lengths to leave no trail, Jen. It's not going to be easy.

Jenny nods, her eyes scanning the documents again.

CUT TO:

INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT

Dr. Samantha Taylor (30s), a brilliant forensic pathologist, examines the victim's body on an autopsy table.

SAMANTHA
(whispering into phone)
...found no signs of struggle or trauma to the skin, but I did notice some anomalies in the DNA samples...

She hangs up the phone and turns to face Jenny, who's now standing beside her.

JENNY
(intrigued)
What is it, Sam?

SAMANTHA
(hesitant)
I think our killer may have used...a specific type of lubricant to make the crime scene almost impossible to analyze.

TOM
(skeptical)
Lubricant? What kind of lubricant?

SAMANTHA
(nervously)
It's an industrial-grade silicone. Rare, but I've seen it before in a few high-end medical procedures.

JENNY
(intently)
Get me the list of all hospitals and clinics within a 50-mile radius that use this type of lubricant. We need to re-question the staff.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY

A young nurse, LUCY BARNES (20s), is being questioned by Jenny.

LUCY
(nervously)
I don't know anything about a lubricant, Detective Ryder. We use it for...for some of our more sensitive procedures, but...

Jenny interrupts Lucy with an aggressive tone.

JENNY
(firmly)
Listen to me, Lucy. I need you to think back to any time in the past month that you or anyone else used this silicone lubricant. Anytime.

Lucy swallows hard before responding.

LUCY
(whispering)
Okay...there was one time. I remember because it was weird. One of our doctors, Dr. Lucas, ordered a large quantity of the lubricant from an online supplier...

Jenny's eyes light up with excitement as she grabs her pen and writes down every detail.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Tom is reviewing case files with Jenny when their boss, CHIEF OF POLICE JIM FOLEY (50s), walks in.

CHIEF
(authoritatively)
Jen, I've got some news that may change the direction of this investigation entirely.

Jenny looks up from her notes.

CHIEF
(serious)
We just received a call from an anonymous tipster who claims to have information about the murder. This person wants to speak with you directly.

CUT TO:

EXT. ISOLATED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Jenny is standing in front of a nondescript warehouse, her gun drawn and her eyes scanning the perimeter.

Suddenly, a figure steps out from the shadows.

THE WHISTLEBLOWER
(unknown)
You're looking for Dr. Lucas? He's...dead now.

JENNY
(stunned)
What do you mean?

WHISTLEBLOWER
(smirking)
Let's just say that our killer decided to cover their tracks, permanently.

As the Whistleblower disappears into the darkness, Jenny is left standing alone, looking at her phone with a mixture of frustration and determination.
