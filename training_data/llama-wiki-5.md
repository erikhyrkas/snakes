Write a wiki article about Uranus.<start>**Uranus**

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system.

**What is Uranus?**

Uranus is a gas giant, meaning it's made mostly of air, with some water and rock. It has no solid surface like Earth does.

**Discovery**

Uranus was discovered by William Herschel on March 13, 1781. He was a British astronomer who looked at the night sky to find new stars and planets.

**Orbit**

Uranus orbits the Sun in 84 Earth years. This is because it's very far from the Sun. Uranus takes about 17 hours to complete one rotation on its side, which means a day on Uranus is longer than an Earth year!

**Rings**

Like Saturn, Uranus has rings around it. But they are thin and hard to see.

**Moons**

Uranus has 27 known moons. The largest moon is Titania.

**Surface**

If you were on the surface of Uranus (which isn't possible), it would be very cold and dark. There's no sunlight because the planet doesn't get much light from the Sun due to its distance.

**Interesting Facts**

* Uranus is tilted on its side, which means that sometimes the poles face the Sun.
* It has a magnetic field that's tipped at an angle of 60 degrees from the planet's rotation.
* The pressure and temperature conditions on Uranus are very extreme, making it inhospitable to life.

Write a wiki article about Evolution.<start>**Evolution**

Evolution is a scientific idea that explains how living things change over time.

**What is Evolution?**

Evolution is the process by which living organisms adapt to their environment and develop new characteristics. This happens through natural selection, genetic variation, and other mechanisms that allow species to evolve and improve their chances of survival.

**Key Concepts**

1. **Variation**: All living things have small differences in their traits, such as eye color or height. These variations are inherited from parents.
2. **Heritage**: Living organisms pass on their traits to their offspring through genes.
3. **Adaptation**: As the environment changes, organisms with certain traits may have an advantage over others. This is called adaptation.
4. **Survival and Selection**: The strongest or most well-adapted organisms are more likely to survive and reproduce.

**Examples of Evolution**

1. **Antibiotic Resistance**: Bacteria that were once sensitive to antibiotics became resistant as humans used these medicines.
2. **High-Altitude Adaptation**: People who live at high altitudes have adapted to the lower oxygen levels by developing more efficient lungs.
3. **Pigeon Breeding**: Humans selectively bred pigeons for specific traits, such as size or color.

**Scientific Evidence**

Evolution is supported by many scientific discoveries:

1. **Fossil Record**: Fossils show a clear pattern of gradual changes in life forms over millions of years.
2. **Comparative Anatomy**: The study of body structures reveals similarities and differences between living organisms.
3. **Genetics**: DNA analysis confirms the shared ancestry among all living things.

**Conclusion**

Evolution is an essential concept in biology that explains how life on Earth has changed over time. By understanding evolution, we can better appreciate the diversity of life and our place within it.

Write a wiki article about Dark matter.<start>**Dark Matter**

Dark matter is a type of matter that we cannot see or directly observe. It was first proposed by Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s.

**What do we know about Dark Matter?**

We know that dark matter makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy density, while regular matter (like stars, planets, and galaxies) accounts for only about 5%. The remaining 68% is thought to be made up of a type of energy called dark energy.

**How was Dark Matter discovered?**

Astronomers noticed that galaxies were moving at speeds that couldn't be explained by the visible matter within them. They proposed that there must be some unseen mass holding everything together, which we now call dark matter.

**Properties of Dark Matter**

Dark matter is thought to have several properties:

* **Invisible**: We can't see it or directly observe it.
* **Massive**: It has a lot of mass, but we don't know what form that takes.
* **Spread out**: It's spread throughout the universe and surrounds regular matter.

**Theories about Dark Matter**

There are several theories about what dark matter might be:

* **WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)**: These particles interact with normal matter only through gravity, making them invisible to our detectors.
* **Axions**: These are hypothetical particles that were first proposed in the 1970s as a way to explain why some particles don't interact with each other the way we expect.

**Research and Detection**

Scientists are using various methods to detect dark matter, including:

* **Gravitational Lensing**: This is when light from distant stars or galaxies bends around massive objects, revealing their presence.
* **Galaxy Rotation Curves**: These measure how fast stars and gas move within a galaxy. If the rotation curves are flat, it suggests that there's some unseen mass holding everything together.

**Conclusion**

Dark matter is a mysterious substance that makes up a large part of our universe. While we can't see or directly observe it, scientists are using various methods to study its properties and understand what it might be made of.
<end>

Write a wiki article about Dark energy.<start>**Dark Energy**

Dark energy is a type of mysterious energy that fills the entire universe. It was first discovered in 1998 by two scientists who were studying how fast galaxies are moving away from each other.

**What is Dark Energy?**

Dark energy is a kind of invisible energy that makes up about 68% of the total mass-energy density of the universe. This means it is much more abundant than regular matter, which makes up only 32%. Despite its abundance, dark energy has never been directly observed or detected in any way.

**How Does Dark Energy Affect the Universe?**

Dark energy is thought to be responsible for a phenomenon called "accelerated expansion." As the universe grows and expands, galaxies are moving away from each other at an increasing rate. This acceleration of expansion is due to dark energy pushing matter apart.

**Theories About Dark Energy**

There are many theories about what dark energy might be. Some scientists think it could be a property of space itself, while others believe it might be related to the behavior of subatomic particles. Despite these theories, the true nature of dark energy remains unknown.

**Importance of Studying Dark Energy**

Studying dark energy is crucial for understanding how the universe came to be the way it is today. It can also provide insights into the ultimate fate of the universe. Scientists continue to research dark energy using a variety of methods, including observations of distant galaxies and simulations on powerful computers.

**Key Figures in Dark Energy Research**

* **Adam Riess**, Saul Perlmutter, and Brian Schmidt were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for their contributions to understanding dark energy.
* **Saul Perlmutter** is a leading researcher who has made significant contributions to our understanding of dark energy.
