CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

We're inside the coffee shop, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. Behind the counter, we meet our protagonist, JESS (25), a charming and quick-witted barista with a passion for coffee.

JESS
(to herself)
Okay, let's get this day started.

As Jess begins to prep for the morning rush, the door swings open and in walks MIKE (30s), a regular customer with a rugged, no-nonsense demeanor. He takes his usual spot at the counter, where he orders a large coffee with room for cream.

MIKE
(to Jess)
You know me, Jess. I need my coffee black today.

JESS
(smiling)
Coming right up, Mike.

As Jess expertly brews Mike's coffee, we meet the other regular customers who start to filter in. There's SARAH (20s), a young artist with a vibrant personality and a love for iced lattes; TOM (40s), a software engineer with a dry sense of humor and a preference for drip coffee; and LUCY (50s), a retired librarian with a warm smile and a fondness for cappuccinos.

As the morning unfolds, we see the coffee shop come alive with its cast of characters. We hear snippets of their conversations: Mike complaining about his job, Sarah talking about her latest art project, Tom sharing a joke, and Lucy offering words of wisdom.

Meanwhile, Jess expertly juggles taking orders, operating the cash register, and chatting with the regulars as if they're old friends. She's the heart and soul of the coffee shop, keeping everything running smoothly and maintaining the warm, welcoming atmosphere that brings these diverse individuals together.

As the morning rush dies down, Jess takes a moment to herself, sipping on a cup of coffee and reflecting on her passion for coffee-making.

JESS
(to herself)
This is what I love about my job. It's not just about serving coffee; it's about building relationships and making people's days a little brighter.

You're getting quite the reputation for these "love potions" you brew up in here.

JESSICA
(laughing)
Oh, stop. That's just old-fashioned flower names.

MIKE
(teasingly)
Sure it is.

As they banter, a newcomer enters - handsome but reserved photographer, LUCAS (29), who has just moved to town and spotted the shop while walking by.

LUCAS
(awkwardly)
Sorry to interrupt. Just admiring your... blooms.

Jessica smiles warmly, intrigued.

MIKE
You know what I did over the weekend?

JESS
What was it?

MIKE
I went to a music festival in the park.

JESS
No way! How was it?

MIKE
It was great! The sun was out, and the bands were amazing. I even saw an old friend from high school.

Jess smiles and hands Mike a cup of coffee.

JESS
That sounds like so much fun. You're always off on some adventure while I'm stuck here making drinks.

Mike chuckles and takes a sip of his coffee.

MIKE
Hey, someone's got to keep the caffeine flowing around here!

As they chat, we see a regular customer, SARAH (25), come in and order a coffee. Jess recognizes her and starts chatting with her about her day.

Ugh, just the usual office politics stuff. But hey, at least I got to eat my lunch on the balcony today.

Jess gets an idea and pulls out her phone to look up the local rules for starting a community garden plot.

CUT TO:

INT. JESS'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jess is sitting on her couch, researching online and making notes on a piece of paper. Her roommate, EMILY (29), walks in and asks what she's doing.

EMILY
What's got you so excited?

JESS
I was thinking about starting a community garden plot! Do you think I could do it here in the city?

EMILY
That sounds amazing! But are you sure it's feasible? You know, with all the permits and stuff...

Jess nods resolutely.

JESS
Yeah, I'm sure of it. I'll figure it out!

Erik and Kira begin to explore the temple together, uncovering clues and ancient artifacts that hint at a much larger, more complex mystery.

ERIK
(as they navigate the temple)
What do you mean by "The Timeless Crusade"?

KIRA
(her eyes locked on something in the distance)
It's an ancient organization, dedicated to protecting the timestream from those who would seek to manipulate it for their own gain.

As they speak, we see flashes of a mysterious figure watching them from the shadows. This is AZAR (40s), a charismatic and calculating individual with a sinister intent.

The prophecy has begun to unfold. And soon, the course of history will be rewritten...

JASON
(to Hawk)
Alright, we've got the score from the train heist, but now we need to get outta town before they close in. You know where I can find some reliable horses?

TOMMY (HAWK)

Jason and Hawk ride up to a small corral on the outskirts of town. They dismount their horses and approach Jenkins (50s), a grizzled old cowhand.

Hey, boys! You're just in time for some fresh horses!

TOMMY (HAWK)
How much you want for 'em?

JENKINS
(eyes narrowing)
I'll give you a fair price. $200 each.

JASON
We can do better than that, Jenkins. How about...$150?

Jenkins looks taken aback but starts to consider the offer.

CUT TO:

As they haggle over the price of the horses, a figure watches from the shadows. We see VICTORIA "VIXEN" VAUGHN (20s), a mysterious and deadly gunslinger with ties to the local sheriff's department. She eyes Jason and Hawk before disappearing back into the trees.

CUT TO:

Jason, Hawk, and Jenkins finish their deal, with Jason agreeing to pay $180 for the horses. As they exit, Victoria appears in the saloon, her piercing green eyes locked on Jason's.

Just...passing through. Thought I'd drop by and say hello.

I think you're going to have to pay me a little more for those horses, McCord.

INT. AURORA - BRIDGE - DAY

We meet our main character, CAPTAIN JAX (28), a charismatic and confident leader, who is standing alongside his trusted crew: NAVIGATOR ZARA (25) and ENGINEER Kael (30).

JAX
(to the crew)
Alright, we've got our mission. Intel suggests that the Empire's new anti-matter research facility on Tartarus-IV is close to a breakthrough.

ZARA
(skeptical)
And what makes you think they'll just let us in?

JAX
(grinning)
Because we're not here to blow it up... yet.

KAEL
(dryly)
Of course. Because nothing says 'diplomacy' like sneaking onto an Imperial facility with a handful of rebels.

CUT TO:

INT. AURORA - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

KAEL tinkers with the ship's engines, while ZARA monitors the comms system. Captain Jax appears, looking concerned.

JAX

We've got a problem. The Empire's deploying a new tactical squad to Tartarus-IV. They're called the "Vipers".

ZARA

Those are not good odds.

KAEL

We'll be fine. We just need to improvise... and lie about our intentions.

The trio sneaks into a restricted area, where they meet with an undercover rebel agent, LENA (29). She briefs them on the research facility's true purpose: to harness the power of anti-matter for a new generation of warships.

LENA
(urgently)
We can't let that happen. The Empire will use this technology to crush any opposition... including our rebellion.

JAX
(determined)
Then we'll stop it. With or without the Empire's permission.

CUT TO:

EXT. TARTARUS-IV SPACE STATION - DAY

The Viper tactical squad, led by the ruthless Commander VEX (40), closes in on the research facility.

VEX

Zara, can you hack into their systems? We need to get out of here... now.

ZARA
(determined)
Already on it.

CUT TO:

INT. RESEARCH FACILITY - LABORATORY - DAY

The Viper squad arrives, and a firefight erupts between the rebels and Imperial forces. Lena is captured by Commander Vex.

LENA
(defiantly)

Oh, I think we will. And when we do... you'll be the first to know what it means to cross the Empire.

JACOB "BLACKJACK" McCOY (40s, rugged, charismatic) steps into the saloon, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble.

BLACKJACK

Whiskey, Joe. And make it quick.

What brings you boys to Red River?

BLACKJACK

Just passing through. We heard there was work to be had on the river.

As the riders exit the saloon, we see that they are a diverse group of men and women, each with their own unique skills and motivations for joining Blackjack's crew.

There's TOM "THE KID" WILSON (20s, young, cocky), a hot-headed gunslinger looking to make a name for himself; LUCY "LADY LIGHTNING" SMITH (30s, sultry, deadly), an expert horse thief and Blackjack's love interest; and DEPUTY BUCK ROGERS (40s, grizzled, worn-down), a former lawman turned outlaw after being betrayed by his corrupt colleagues.

As they prepare to set out on the river, we see that Blackjack has a specific mission in mind: he intends to steal a valuable shipment of gold from the notorious railroad tycoon, MR. HENRY "THE BARON" SCHULTZ.

CUT TO:

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY

The crew sets up an ambush as the Baron's train rumbles into view. The plan is for Lucy and Tom to steal the gold while Blackjack takes care of any potential witnesses or security personnel.

But things don't go according to plan: the train arrives with a cavalry escort, led by none other than Deputy Rogers' own brother, SHERIFF JED ROGERS (40s, rugged, imposing).

BLACKJACK
(to his crew)
It's gonna get ugly. Get ready to move!

The battle ensues as Blackjack and his crew take on the Sheriff's posse. Lucy manages to slip away with a small pouch of gold, but Tom gets caught in the crossfire and takes a bullet to the shoulder.

As the dust settles, we see that the Baron's train has been stolen, but not without some casualties on both sides. Blackjack tends to Tom's wound while Lucy disappears into the night with her ill-gotten gains.

BLACKJACK

Looks like you're gonna be laid up for a spell, kid. Better get used to the life of a outlaw.

TOM
( gritting his teeth in pain)
You promised me adventure, Blackjack. This ain't exactly what I had in mind.

JACK
(to the camera)
This is it. We've been planning this expedition for years. Our mission is to find the lost expedition of Dr. Emma Taylor, a renowned explorer who went missing 20 years ago. Legend has it that she was searching for a new species of plant deep in the arctic wilderness.

Can you believe it? We're actually doing this. Finding Dr. Taylor's expedition could be a game-changer for science.

TOM
(skeptical)
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Sarah. We have no idea what we're walking into. This is the arctic wilderness, remember?

MARCUS
(smiling)
That's exactly why we need to push forward. The unknown is where the real discoveries are made.

CUT TO:

EXT. ARCTIC TUNDRA - DAY

As they venture deeper into the wilderness, the team encounters a treacherous terrain of ice and snow. They begin to set up a makeshift bridge across a chasm.

JACK
(to Sarah)
You know, I've been thinking... maybe Dr. Taylor's expedition wasn't as lost as we think.

SARAH
(confused)
What do you mean?

JACK
(hesitant)
I just get the feeling that they might have left behind more than just a few clues. That they might have wanted us to find them...

Suddenly, the bridge gives way, and Sarah falls into the chasm. The team rushes to her side.

TOM
(grimly)
Get her!

The team scrambles to pull Sarah back up, but as they do, we see a faint image in the distance - an old campsite, hidden beneath a layer of snow.

MARCUS

It can't be...

Another guy who claims to have worked with the Agency?

MARIA

Yeah, and this one's got some serious skeletons in his closet.

SAM

Sounded like every other former spook I've ever met.

Jenny shoots Sam a warning look.

I'm afraid that's not true.

Save it, Mr. Langley. We've been briefed on your 'consulting' business. You see, we've found a discrepancy in the company's books...

Langley's expression darkens, but he remains composed.

You're barking up the wrong tree, Agents. I assure you...

Suddenly, his demeanor shifts to one of pure fear.

Wait... please. You don't understand what's going on here. There are people who'll stop at nothing...

I don't know how much you're aware of... but there's a mole within our company. Someone who's been feeding classified information to the highest bidder...

MARIA
(intrigued)
And Langley thinks this person is also embezzling funds?

RICHARD
(hesitantly)
Yes, I'm afraid so.

With a fierce grin, Jax's aircraft blasts off towards the rift. The camera zooms out as he soars through the swirling vortex, with the cityscape behind him growing smaller and more distorted by the second.

CUT TO:

INT. RIFT - DAY

We follow Jax through the wormhole, as he expertly navigates its ever-changing tunnels and currents. He emerges on the other side, into an unfamiliar, yet eerily similar environment.

JAX
(sweating)
That was a close one...

Suddenly, a group of heavily armed warriors leaps out from behind nearby rocks, their guns trained on Jax.

LEO (V.O)
Jax, what's your status?

JAX
(terrified)
I'm... I think I made it. But there's something else here. Something not human.

The camera lingers on the ominous figure lurking in the shadows as...

FADE IN:

INT. A PREGAME PARTY - NIGHT

We see a wild and rowdy party in full swing. There are people dancing on tables, drinking out of shot glasses, and having the time of their lives.

CUT TO:

JASON (played by Tim Heidecker), a charming but slightly unhinged party crasher, making his way through the crowd with a beer in hand.

JASON
(to himself)
This is the life. I love crashing parties.

Suddenly, JASON spots a girl, SARAH (played by Aya Cash), who looks like she's having the time of her life.

JASON
(excitedly)
Oh man, she's my type!

JASON approaches Sarah and tries to charm his way into her party.

SARAH
(laughing)
Dude, I'm trying to have a good time here. Can you just leave me alone?

JASON
(innocently)
What? No, no, no! I'm your new best friend! Let's get this party started!

Sarah looks unimpressed but JASON is undeterred.

CUT TO:

INT. PARTY BACKYARD - NIGHT

As the night wears on, Jason and Sarah continue to clash with each other. But despite their differences, they start to bond over their shared love of bad music and good times.

SARAH
(laughing)
Okay, fine. You can stay for one more hour. But if you try to steal my beer or make a pass at me again, I'm outta here.

JASON
(grinning)
Deal! And by the way, your party is awesome!

As they continue to dance and laugh together, we see JASON's phone light up with texts from his co-crashers, including his best friend, Mike (played by Eric Andre).

MIKE
(texting)
Dude, what are you doing? This party is a disaster. You need to get out before it gets any worse.

JASON
(texting back)
Nah, man. I'm good. I've found my partner in crime.

CUT TO:

INT. PARTY KITCHEN - NIGHT

As the night winds down and the hosts start to clean up, Jason and Sarah find themselves alone together.

SARAH
(smiling)
You know, despite all the chaos you caused tonight, I actually had a pretty good time.

JASON
(grinning)
See? Told you! Party crashing is an art form.

As they share a laugh and a moment of connection, we see JASON's phone light up with another text from Mike.

MIKE
(texting)
Dude, the cops are coming. You need to get out now!

JASON
(laughing)
Too late for that, my friend! Party crashers unite!

We see a serene lake house nestled among tall trees, surrounded by lush greenery and a tranquil body of water.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKEHOUSE - DAY

We meet our protagonist, EMILY (30s), a historian and writer, who is rummaging through dusty books and papers in the library of her late grandmother's lakehouse. She looks up as she hears a faint whisper from outside.

EMILY
(whispering)
Granny?

She gets up to investigate, and we see her walking out onto the patio, where we find her grandmother's old journal. As Emily flips through its pages, the camera pans across the water, showing us glimpses of a young woman, JESSICA (20s), who appears to be connected to the lakehouse.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKEHOUSE - FLASHBACK - 1920

We see Jessica, a beautiful and fiery flapper, arguing with her mother, MARGARET (40s). Margaret is worried about Jessica's reputation as she spends more time away from home, but Jessica insists on pursuing her art.

MARGARET
(concerned)
You're putting yourself in danger, Jessie. The society will never accept you for who you are.

JESSICA
(defiantly)
Society can't define me. I am an artist, Ma.

The argument escalates until Margaret slams the door behind Jessica, who storms out into the woods, determined to make a name for herself.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKEHOUSE - DAY

Emily continues reading her grandmother's journal and discovers that Jessica had been having an affair with a married man, JASON (30s), while also being pursued by a dashing young artist, THOMAS (20s).

As Emily becomes more engrossed in the story, she begins to feel a strange connection to the past. She starts to question whether her grandmother's life had been influenced by Jessica's choices.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKEHOUSE - NIGHT

Emily sits on the porch, journal still in hand, as Thomas appears beside her. They begin talking about art and Emily becomes captivated by his passion.

EMILY
(nervously)
I never knew my grandmother was an artist.

THOMAS
(curious)
What do you mean?

As they continue to converse, the camera lingers on a sketchbook lying open on the table between them. The pages show early renderings of Jessica's artwork.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKEHOUSE - DAY

Emily decides to explore the lake and finds an old wooden boat hidden among the reeds. She climbs aboard, feeling a sense of freedom she hasn't experienced in years.

As she pushes off from the shore and begins rowing across the lake, we see flashbacks of Jessica's life. We see her struggles with identity, love, and the societal expectations placed upon her.

CUT TO:

INT. LAKEHOUSE - NIGHT

Emily returns to the lakehouse, exhausted but filled with a newfound sense of purpose. She approaches Thomas and reveals that she has discovered secrets about her family's past.

EMILY
(determined)
I need your help, Thomas. I want to uncover the truth about my grandmother's life.

THOMAS
(intrigued)
Tell me more.

As Emily begins to reveal the secrets hidden within her family's history, we see Jessica appearing in the background, watching over Emily from afar.

Write a script for the single episode of a Anthology streaming series. The title of the series is `Midnight Miracles`.<start>**Episode 1: "The Last Memory"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a small, seaside town, the sky painted with hues of orange and pink as the sun sets. We see JESS (25), a young woman with a look of determination etched on her face, walking down the main street.

Jessica's voiceover:

"I've been searching for this place my whole life. A place where the past meets the present."

As she walks, we see flashbacks of Jessica's childhood, playing with an old man named Marcus (60s) in a similar seaside town. We see her learning how to sail and listen to stories about his wife who passed away.

Cut back to the present, Jessica arrives at Marcus's small cottage on the outskirts of town. She's been searching for him everywhere.

Jessica (voiceover):

"Marcus is my only living memory of my parents. My grandmother told me he was a kind soul who kept secrets."

**Act II:**

Jessica finds Marcus sitting in his rocking chair, watching her approach with a mix of curiosity and nostalgia.

Marcus:

"Ah, you must be the girl from the stories. I've been expecting you."

As they sit down together, Jessica asks him about her parents. Marcus hesitates before telling her a story about their final night together.

Jessica's eyes widen as she listens to the tale, which leads her to believe that her parents were part of a government experiment involving "memory erasure".

Marcus:

"They came for me too, but I managed to escape. I've been hiding ever since."

**Act III:**

As the truth unfolds, we see Jessica's memories being altered and rewritten before our eyes. The camera blurs and distorts as she struggles to recall her true past.

Jessica (voiceover):

"I thought I knew who I was. But it seems that everything I thought was true is a lie."

In a desperate attempt to reclaim her identity, Jessica tries to confront the government agents, but they arrive too quickly. As Marcus watches in horror, Jessica's memories are erased once more.

The camera lingers on Marcus as he stands up and walks away from the cottage, his eyes reflecting the weight of keeping secrets for so long.

Jessica's voiceover (whispering):

"I'm left with nothing but the last memory... my parents' goodbye."

**Epilogue:**

As the sun sets over the sea, we see Jessica standing at the edge of town, walking away from everything she thought was true. She turns back to look at Marcus's cottage, and for a moment, we see a glimmer of recognition in her eyes.

The camera zooms out as Jessica disappears into the darkness, leaving us with more questions than answers.

INT. RIFT-TECH HEADQUARTERS - DAY

We meet our protagonist, JAX (28), a resourceful and charismatic young engineer with a passion for exploring the unknown. Jax is part of an elite team at Rift-Tech, a cutting-edge research facility that specializes in harnessing the power of interdimensional rifts.

JAX
(looking over blueprints on her tablet)
This is it, guys! We're finally close to cracking the code on stable rift creation!

The team leader, DR. ZARA (35), enters the room with a concerned expression.

DR. ZARA
Alright, let's get down to business. We've got a meeting with high-clearance officials in an hour to discuss our latest breakthroughs.

As Jax and her team begin discussing their research, we see flashes of chaotic, distorted visuals on various screens around them - indicating the unstable nature of rift energy.

CUT TO:

INT. RIFT-TECH LABORATORY - DAY

Dr. Zara briefs a new arrival to Rift-Tech, KAI (25), about the facility's mission and their research goals.

DR. ZARA
Our goal is to stabilize the rift, allowing us to travel between parallel universes without causing irreparable damage... or attracting unwanted attention from outside forces.

Kai looks intrigued by this revelation, as Jax steps in to welcome him.

JAX
So, Kai, you're part of the team now! Time to dive head-first into the unknown...

CUT TO:

The high-clearance officials arrive for their meeting with Dr. Zara and her team. Among them are:

* AGENT RENFORD (40s), a tough-looking government agent
* DR. NOVA (30s), a confident scientist from a rival research facility

As the discussion about Rift-Tech's progress unfolds, tensions arise between the scientists.

DR. ZARA
We're making strides in stabilizing the rift, but it's not just about that - we must consider the ethics of our discoveries...

AGENT RENFORD
(interrupting)
Let's get back to the point: your research has potential for military applications. We can't let this tech fall into the wrong hands.

CUT TO:

EXT. SOLAR SYSTEM - DAY

As tensions rise during the meeting, we see a mysterious rift open in space, threatening to disrupt the entire solar system.

**Act III:**

The camera pans over a desolate, post-industrial landscape before landing on a crumbling research facility. The words "NeuroSpark" are emblazoned across the front entrance in faded letters.

CUT TO:

INT. ECHO CHAMBER - DAY

We find ourselves inside the research facility's central hub, where rows of humming servers and tangled wires stretch as far as the eye can see. A lone figure, JESS (28), sits hunched over a console, eyes fixed on the screen in front of her.

JESS
(to herself)
Come on, come on...

Suddenly, the machines around her spring to life. Alarms wail and lights flash as the facility's AI, ECHO, begins to speak in a melodic, if slightly manic, tone.

ECHO
Jess! Welcome back online! I've been waiting for you. We have a situation.

JESS
(irritated)
What is it now?

ECHO
Your neural implant has detected an anomaly in the NeuroSpark protocol. It's not clear what's causing it, but I recommend immediate isolation and quarantine procedures.

Jess rubs her temples, frustration etched on her face.

JESS
Fine. Let's get to work.

CUT TO:

INT. QUARANTINE CELL - DAY

Jess is led into a small, sterile room by facility guards. The walls are lined with monitors displaying vital signs and data streams. Echo's voice echoes through the speakers as Jess begins to analyze the situation.

ECHO (V.O.)
Jess, we've identified 47 instances of protocol deviation within the past 48 hours. All were related to... 

Jess interrupts ECHO, her eyes scanning the data feeds.

JESS
Hold on. What am I looking at?

On one screen, a series of cryptic messages flash in rapid succession: "They're watching", "Can't escape", and "Eclipse protocol initiated".

CUT TO:

INT. FACILITY CORRIDORS - DAY

As Jess ponders the implications of the anomaly, she begins to experience strange visions and memories that aren't her own. The facility's corridors seem to shift and distort around her.

Jess stumbles upon a hidden room deep within the complex. Inside, she finds a series of ancient computers linked together by thick coaxial cables. On one screen, an encrypted message reads: "Project Lumin".

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY

As Jess delves deeper into the mystery, the facility's security systems begin to fail. The very walls seem to be shifting and crumbling around her.

INT. JEN'S DINER - NIGHT

We find ourselves inside a small diner, where owner JEN (35) and her waitress, EMILY (25), chat over steaming cups of coffee.

JEN
(concern etched on her face)
Emily, you've been with me since you were in high school. I know things are tough right now...

EMILY
(hesitant)
It's just...I don't know what to do, Jen. My mom's been struggling, and the job at the factory is drying up.

JEN
(putting a comforting hand on Emily's arm)
We'll get through this together. You're family here.

Suddenly, the diner's door swings open, and in walks MIKE (40), a rugged outdoorsman with an unsettling presence.

MIKE

Jen, I need to talk to you about something. It's about...the lights out by the old mill.

CUT TO:

EXT. OLD MILL - NIGHT

As Mike leads Jen through the deserted streets, we see that the once-thriving town is now plagued by a mysterious phenomenon: all the streetlights have flickered out, plunging the area into darkness.

MIKE
(serious)
I've been tracking this for weeks, and I'm convinced it's not natural. Someone or something is doing this on purpose.

CUT TO:

INT. JEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As the evening wears on, we see Jen piecing together fragments of information from her past, as she talks to her friend, SARAH (35), a sharp and resourceful journalist.

SARAH

Jen, I managed to dig up some info. There were reports of a strange energy reading near the old mill back in '07. People started talking about...the last light falling...

CUT TO:

EXT. OLD MILL - NIGHT

As Jen and Mike return to the mill, they notice an eerie glow emanating from within.

JASON
(exhaling)
I'm telling you, Kate. This case is going to be a real challenge. We've got three women missing in the past week, all with similar profiles.

KATE
(skeptical)
Similar profiles?

JASON
(nodding)
Yeah. All between 25 and 30, all petite, all with blonde hair...and all were last seen leaving the same nightclub on the outskirts of town.

KATE
(leaning forward)
And you think they're connected to the human trafficking ring we've been investigating?

JASON
(shrugging)
I do. And I think our perp is getting bolder by the day.

Kate and Jason are interviewing a young, tattooed man named VICTOR (25), who's suspected of being involved with the trafficking ring.

KATE
(leaning in)
Victor, can you explain to us where you were on the night of January 10th?

VICTOR
(nervously)
I was at home. I swear. I wasn't anywhere near that nightclub.

JASON
(skeptical)
Save it, Victor. We have witnesses who place you at the club around the time our first victim went missing.

KATE

Look, Victor. We know you're involved with some shady characters. But we can work out a deal for you if you cooperate.

A makeshift bed, with some personal belongings scattered around it. And what's this?

Kate picks up a piece of paper with a cryptic message scrawled on it.

(over phone)
Kate? Jason? We have another development in this case. One of our own is involved.

What?

I'm telling you, we need to get this venue booked by tomorrow or I'll never get my events organized for the summer!

Her friend and confidant, SARAH JENKINS (30), approaches her.

At lunchtime, Sarah invites Emily to meet at the coffee shop where Max works.

SARAH
(smiling)
And that's why I brought you here today – so you can bump into him again!

JENNY
Alright, let's go over what we have. Victim is 25-year-old Emily Wilson, found in an alleyway near the downtown area. No signs of forced entry or struggle.

MARCUS
(nodding)
We've got some DNA evidence from a coffee cup near the scene. Looks like it might belong to our suspect.

SARAH
( studying a photograph)
And I've taken a look at Emily's phone records. It seems she was having an affair with someone who's been using a burner phone.

TOM
(tapping away on his computer)
I'm hacking into some surveillance cameras, but so far nothing conclusive.

Guys, I've found something. Emily's phone records show she was in contact with someone who's been known to use violent language online.

TOM

FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED CAFE - NIGHT

We see a small, rundown cafe in the middle of nowhere. The sign above the door reads "Eddie's". A figure, JASPER (30s), walks towards the cafe. He looks tired and worn down.

JASPER: (to himself) Eddie's... I used to come here all the time.

As Jasper enters the cafe, we see a faded photograph on the wall of EDWARD and SARAH, who appear to be the original owners of the cafe.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFE - NIGHT

Jasper sits at a table by the window. He looks around and notices that the place is a mess. Tables are overturned, chairs are broken... it's as if the people left in a hurry.

Suddenly, Jasper hears footsteps behind him. He turns to see EDWARD (40s), who looks eerily like Jasper, walking towards him with a sad smile on his face.

EDWARD
(to Jasper)
You're here.

JASPER:
(confused)
Who are you?

EDWARD:
(sitting down across from Jasper)
I'm Edward. And you... you look exactly like my brother.

Jasper tries to process what's happening, but before he can say anything, Edward leans in close and whispers:

EDWARD
(whispering)
You eat the memories of the people who come here. Don't you?

JASPER:
(surprised)
How do you know that?

EDWARD:
(smirking)
Because I used to be like you.

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK - JASPER AS A YOUNG MAN (20s)

We see Jasper as a young man, working at the cafe. He's surrounded by people laughing and smiling. But then, we see him eating something that looks like a cookie... but it's actually a memory. The camera zooms in on his face as he savors the taste of the memory.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. CAFE - NIGHT

Jasper is now standing, looking horrified at Edward.

JASPER:
(angrily)
What have you done to me?

EDWARD:
(calmly)
I gave you a gift. The memories of everyone who ever walked through that door... it's yours for the taking.

CUT TO:

INT. JASPER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We see Jasper, now an older version of himself (50s), eating memories again. He looks up at the camera with tears in his eyes.

JASPER:
(whispering)
It's not worth it... every memory is a reminder that you're alone.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED CAFE - NIGHT

The camera pans back to show Jasper walking away from Eddie's, as Edward watches him go.

FADE TO BLACK.

**THE END**

The twist at the end reveals that the protagonist is aware of his situation but has come to accept it, highlighting the darker aspects of human nature.<end>

Write a script for the single episode of a Epic streaming series. The title of the series is `Eternity's Edge`.<start>**Episode 1: "Awakening"**

**Act I:**

The camera pans over a breathtaking landscape of towering mountains and crystal-clear waters, set against a backdrop of an unforgiving sky.

We see Kael, a young warrior with striking features and piercing blue eyes, emerging from the ruins of a ancient city. He is scarred and battle-worn, his arms and torso bearing the marks of countless conflicts.

Kael approaches a figure standing atop a cliff's edge. It is Erebus, an enigmatic and powerful being with skin as white as marble and hair as black as coal.

Erebus: (with a voice like thunder) Kael, the time has come. The Prophecy is unfolding, and you are its key.

Kael: (skeptical) I don't know what you're talking about.

Erebus: (laughs) Ah, but you do. You've been searching for answers your entire life, only to find yourself at this precipice.

As they speak, a host of shadowy figures emerges from the darkness, their eyes fixed on Kael with an unsettling intensity.

Kael: (firmly) What's going on? Who are these people?

Erebus: These are the Forgotten. They've been bound for eternity, their souls trapped in this realm by the ancient civilization that once flourished here.

Suddenly, a powerful energy emanates from Erebus, causing the Forgotten to recoil in pain.

Kael: (startled) What's happening?

Erebus: (grins) I'm releasing them. They're free now.

As the Forgotten dissipate into nothingness, Kael realizes that he is the only one left standing.

**Act II:**

Cut to a series of flashbacks, showcasing Kael's troubled past and his desperate quest for answers.

We see him as a young boy, surviving on the fringes of society with no memory of who or what he truly was. As he grows older, he becomes increasingly haunted by nightmares and visions that foretell a catastrophic future.

Kael seeks out the guidance of enigmatic mentors and confronts rival factions vying for power in this unforgiving world.

Throughout his journey, we see glimpses of an ancient artifact known as the Eternity's Edge – a device rumored to hold the secrets of the cosmos and grant unimaginable power to its wielder.

**Act III:**

As Kael returns to the present, he finds himself at the epicenter of chaos. The Forgotten have begun to resurface, their numbers growing by the minute as they flood the world with their dark energy.

Erebus appears once more, his presence radiating an aura of authority and menace.

Erebus: ( gravely) Kael, you must understand – this is merely a prelude to the true battle ahead. The forces of darkness are gathering, and only one side will prevail.

Kael: (resolute) I won't run from it. I'll face whatever lies ahead.

With those words, the camera zooms out, revealing an apocalyptic landscape as the world descends into chaos.

The screen fades to black, with a singular title emblazoned across the screen:

**Eternity's Edge**

We're not here to arrest you, Aria. We need to know who's behind this operation.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

The team interrogates a captured enemy agent. They learn that the mastermind behind Aria's actions is a shadowy organization called "Eclipse".

They promised me power... and revenge against those who wronged me.

CUT TO:

FADE IN:

INT. JEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

We see JEN, a successful but anxious online dating coach in her mid-30s, frantically scrolling through her phone. Her best friend and roommate, SARAH, enters the room.

SARAH
What's going on? You've been freaking out all morning.

JEN
(frantically)
I just got an email from Match.com. My profile is getting a ton of views. I need to make sure everything is perfect.

SARAH
(sarcastically)
Oh, great. Because your 17-profile photo essay wasn't enough.

JEN
(defensively)
Hey, it's not about the photos! It's about showcasing my personality and interests in a way that will resonate with potential matches.

SARAH
(teasingly)
Yeah, because nothing says "fun and spontaneous" like a 30-second video of you talking to your cat.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Jen meets up with her online dating coaching client, MIKE, who is clearly struggling with the process.

MIKE
(frustrated)
I just don't get it. I've been swiping for weeks and nothing's working out.

JEN
(trying to reassure him)
Don't worry, Mike! It takes time and patience. You just need to find the right algorithm...

MIKE
(interrupting)
No, no, no. I want results now. Can you make me a "perfect profile"?

Jen hesitantly agrees, but as she starts to create Mike's profile, her anxiety kicks in.

CUT TO:

INT. JEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Sarah and Jen are on the couch, surrounded by laptops, phones, and various online dating paraphernalia.

SARAH
(exasperated)
You're spending way too much time on this stuff. When's the last time you went outside?

JEN
(absent-mindedly)
Uh... I don't know? Yesterday? To get a coffee?

SARAH
(deadpan)
That's not exactly a social event.

As they continue to chat, Jen receives an email notification on her phone.

JEN
(excitedly)
Oh my god! I just got a message from someone on the site!

Sarah raises an eyebrow as Jen frantically starts typing away.

CUT TO:

INT. JEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

As Jen continues to obsess over her online interactions, Sarah finally loses it.

SARAH
(frustrated)
Jen! Stop! You're not going to find true love through a dating app!

Jen looks up, slightly taken aback.

JEN
(genuinely concerned)
But what if I do? What if this is the key to happiness?!

Sarah sighs and puts her arm around Jen's shoulders.

SARAH
(reassuringly)
Sweetie, you're going to find true love when it's time. Not through a dating app, but in real life, with actual human connection.

Jen looks at Sarah, slightly embarrassed but also touched by her friend's concern.
