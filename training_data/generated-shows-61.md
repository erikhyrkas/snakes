Jess hooks up a VHS player, inserts the tape, and presses play. The static-filled screen flickers to life. We see a young couple, MIKE (20s) and SARAH (20s), laughing and being filmed in their living room.

As they chat, we realize this is not just any tape - it's Mike and Sarah's anniversary recording from 1987. They discuss their plans for the future...

MIKE

I'm going to propose to you on New Year's Eve!

SARAH

We meet our protagonist, JACK HARRIS (35), a former Army Ranger turned private investigator. He's behind the wheel, his eyes fixed on the road ahead. His wife, SARAH (32), sits beside him, her hair tied back in a ponytail as she scrolls through her phone.

SARAH
(whispering)
Hey, Jack? Can we talk about this?

JACK
(distracted)
What's up, Sarah?

SARAH
(exasperated)
You know exactly what I'm talking about. We've been driving for hours, and still no sign of them. You said they'd be here.

Jack takes a deep breath before speaking.

JACK
(serious)
Listen, Sarah... this is going to be a tough day. But we're doing it together, okay?

Sarah looks concerned but nods in understanding.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN OF TAOS - DAY

The truck pulls into the parking lot of a small diner in the heart of Taos. Jack and Sarah exit the vehicle, stretching their legs after hours on the road.

They enter the diner, where they're greeted by the friendly owner, LUCY (50s). She's a no-nonsense woman with a quick smile and an even quicker wit.

LUCY
(welcoming)
Hey there! Take a seat, kids. What brings you to Taos?

JACK
(friendly)
We're just passing through, ma'am. Looking for some information on an old acquaintance.

Lucy raises an eyebrow as Jack hands her his business card. Sarah leans in close, whispering something in Jack's ear.

LUCY
(intrigued)
Oh? You know Mike Ortega?

Jack nods curtly before speaking.

JACK
(focused)
Yeah... we did some work with him back in the day. And now... he's gone missing.

Lucy leans back in her chair, eyes narrowing as she thinks for a moment.

LUCY
(concerned)
Well... I don't know what to say. Mike just vanished into thin air. Left behind his family and business. Some folks are whispering it was more than just a simple disappearance...

Sarah glances at Jack with worry etched on her face, while Jack's expression remains stoic.

JACK
(probing)
What kind of whispers?

Lucy leans in close, lowering her voice as she speaks.

LUCY
(serious)
Whispers about his involvement in some... unsavory dealings. People are saying he was involved with some bad folks, the kind who'd rather see people disappear than face justice...

Jack's eyes narrow as he processes this information. The camera lingers on his face for a moment before cutting to:

EXT. TOWN OF TAOS - DAY

We see Jack and Sarah walking through the quiet streets of Taos, their footsteps echoing off the buildings. They're in discussion, their voices hushed.

As they walk, we see glimpses of the people around them: shopkeepers going about their day, children playing outside... The atmosphere is tranquil, yet somehow foreboding.

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Jack and Sarah are sitting on a worn couch, laptops open as they sift through information on Mike Ortega's disappearance.

Sarah types away on her laptop while Jack studies the documents in front of him. His expression remains grim.

JACK
(serious)
Alright... it looks like Mike was involved with some shady people all right. But there's something more going on here...

SARAH
(skeptical)
What do you mean?

Jack leans back, his eyes scanning the room before focusing on Sarah.

JACK
(persistent)
I think this is just a small piece of a much bigger puzzle. I've been looking into some other cases... ones that all seem to be connected in some way...

Sarah looks puzzled as Jack's voice trails off. The camera lingers on his face, showing the determination etched there.

ASTRID
(to her comms device)
JAX, what's the situation?

JAX (V.O.)
 Astrid, we've got multiple reports of a rogue energy signature emanating from an abandoned warehouse on 5th and Main. Looks like our culprit is using some advanced tech to siphon energy from the city grid.

ASTRID
(nodding)
Got it. I'm en route.

Astrid leaps into action, using her powers to dash across the rooftops towards the target location.

**Act II:**

Astrid! I've been waiting for you. You're just in time to witness my masterpiece: Nexus Protocol!

Astrid leaps off the catwalk and charges towards the mercenaries, using her agility and combat training to take them down one by one. Meanwhile, Victor unleashes the Nexus Protocol's full power, creating a reality-bending rift that begins to warp space-time itself.

ASTRID

I need to get the energy signature back online... or risk destabilizing the entire city!

Astrid uses her powers to connect with the city grid and redirect the stolen energy back into its original channels. The mercenaries disappear as they're absorbed by their own technology.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Victor is confronted by Astrid, who's managed to close the Nexus Protocol portal.

ASTRID

It's over, Victor. You've gone too far this time.

Astrid uses her powers to create a localized containment field around Victor and his tech, rendering them powerless.

Jason looks down at his stained shirt and holds up a bag of Cheetos.

JASON

Hey, these are artisanal Cheetos! They're like...gourmet.

MIKE
(unimpressed)
You know what's not gourmet? Adulting. You need to get a real job, Jason. Not just a gig here and there.

JASON
(laughing)
A "real" job? What does that even mean?

LUC:
(hesitant)
But, Jacques, you know as well as I that the Templars have been sniffing around for weeks, looking to monopolize the saffron market. Do we really want to get mixed up with them?

Ah, Guillaume... Jacques de la Roche has been a thorn in our side for far too long. I fear he may be more cunning than we anticipated.

We see a sprawling metropolis, with towering spires and grand architecture that seems to defy gravity. The sky above is a deep shade of indigo, with stars beginning to twinkle as the sun sets.

CUT TO:

INT. GREAT HALL OF THE ORACLE'S TEMPLE - DAY

The camera pans across a crowded room filled with ROGUES (human warriors and assassins) from all corners of the world. They've gathered for a clandestine meeting, their faces shrouded in shadows. A figure stands at the center of the hall, hood up and face obscured.

**THE ORACLE (VO)**

Greetings, travelers. I am Arkea, Oracle of El'goroth. You have all come seeking answers to questions that haunt your souls.

As she speaks, a hooded figure approaches her from across the room. We see his eyes, piercing green, as he steps forward.

**AXELER (a rogue)**

Arkea... I seek truth about my sister's disappearance. Some say she was taken by dark forces. Others claim...

The Oracle raises a hand, silencing him.

**THE ORACLE**

No, Axel, you'll learn the answers you seek in due time. For now, understand that El'goroth is no more. A catastrophic event known as "The Great Devastation" has reshaped our world. The balance of power has shifted...

Suddenly, an alarm blares through the temple.

**THE ORACLE**

What's this? We have... uninvited guests.

CUT TO:

EXT. TEMPLE COMPOUND - DAY

A company of heavily armed GUARDIANS (soldiers clad in ornate armor) storm the temple grounds, led by a commander who appears determined to put an end to the Oracle's activities.

**COMMANDER VORAX**

It is our duty to protect El'goroth from those who would exploit its power. You're all under arrest for... (he spits on the ground)

Vorax turns back to his guards, as the camera pans up to reveal the temple's intricate architecture, with ancient runes etched into the walls.

**AXELER (whispering)**

The Oracle was right. We've only just begun to understand...

CUT TO:

INT. ORACLE'S CHAMBERS - DAY

Arkea stands before a gleaming crystal orb, which serves as her focal point for divination. She gazes into the orb's depths, seeking guidance.

**THE ORACLE (to herself)**

...the Last Oracle Standing. Those words echo through my mind. What do they mean? Have I been chosen to bear this burden alone?

The camera zooms in on Arkea's face as she contemplates her role and the uncertain future ahead.

EXT. HAUNTED HAVEN - NIGHT

We see a small, isolated cabin nestled deep in the woods. The camera pans across the overgrown garden and weathered wooden sign that reads "Haunted Haven".

CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

We meet our host, LUCY (30s), a charming and witty woman who has inherited the cabin from her estranged grandmother. Lucy is setting up for a new life in the cabin, surrounded by memories of her grandmother's eccentricities.

LUCY: (to herself) I used to think Gran was just a bit... odd. But now that she's gone, I'm starting to realize how much more there was to her than met the eye.

As Lucy unpacks and sets up for the night, strange noises start echoing through the cabin - creaking floorboards, faint whispers in the walls, and the sound of a door opening and closing on its own.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCY'S JOURNAL - FLASHBACK

We see a series of flashbacks from Lucy's childhood, where she and her grandmother would spend hours playing with an antique music box. The music box was said to contain "memories" that only revealed themselves when the tune was played just right.

CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Lucy starts to experience strange visions, hearing whispers in her ear, and feeling a presence around her. She realizes that her grandmother's journal is filled with cryptic messages, pointing to an ancient ritual that allows one to capture and keep memories.

As the night wears on, Lucy becomes more and more entangled in the mystery of her grandmother's past. She discovers an old trunk hidden in the attic, containing a series of photographs, love letters, and newspaper clippings.

CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see Lucy's grandmother, MARGARET, performing the ancient ritual, capturing memories from people all around her. As she plays the music box, we see visions of happiness, sadness, and tragedy from those who had their memories taken.

CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Lucy realizes that she has inherited not only the cabin but also her grandmother's secrets. She understands that the memories captured by the ritual are not just personal experiences but also fragments of people's souls.

As Lucy finally closes the trunk and locks it, we see a figure in the shadows watching her. It's revealed to be... Lucy herself.

LUCY: (whispering) I've been trying to remember something for weeks now. A specific date, a specific event... but my mind keeps drawing a blank.

The camera pans out as Lucy looks at her hands, realizing that she too has become a "memory keeper". The music box starts playing, and the screen fades to black.

We see a dilapidated space station, floating in the vastness of space. The only signs of life are a few flickering lights and a steady hum of machinery.

CUT TO:

INT. SPACE STATION - DAY

We meet our protagonist, CAPTAIN JASPER WYNTON (35), a grizzled astronaut who has been surviving on the station for years. He's surrounded by old computer screens, wires, and various gadgets.

JASPER
(to himself)
Still got power. Still got air. What more could I want?

Suddenly, his comms device beeps. Jasper's eyes light up as he answers it.

JASPER
(into comms device)
Hello? This is Jasper Winton. Who is this?

VOICE FROM COMMS DEVICE (V.O.)
Captain Winton, this is... Elysium. We've been monitoring your transmissions for years. We're on our way to you.

Jasper's expression changes from skepticism to hope as he realizes the implications.

CUT TO:

INT. SPACE STATION - DAY

As Jasper waits anxiously for his rescuers to arrive, we see flashbacks of his past: his life before the space station, his relationships with friends and family, and the catastrophic event that led to his isolation.

Jasper's voiceover narrates his story as we see:

* CAPTAIN JASPER WYNTON (25) on a mission to Mars
* A massive solar flare destroying their ship and stranding Jasper on the space station
* Years of loneliness, desperation, and survival

As the past fades away, we return to the present. Jasper is now pacing around his living quarters, trying to prepare for the arrival of Elysium.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED SPACE STATION - DAY

The camera pans out as we see a sleek, futuristic spacecraft approaching the space station. The ship lands with a gentle thud, and Jasper's eyes widen in excitement.

Jasper rushes to the airlock, waiting for his rescuers to arrive. But as he opens the door, he's met with an unsettling sight:

A group of figures, dressed in hazmat suits, step out of the spacecraft. They're not smiling.

JASPER
(confused)
What... what do you want?

LEAD FIGURE (in hazmat suit)
Captain Winton, we've come to retrieve you. But first, we need to take some samples.

Jasper's eyes dart around, searching for an explanation. As the lead figure begins to scan him with a device, Jasper's expression turns from hope to unease.

We see a grand, centuries-old château perched atop a hill, its stone walls covered in vines and ivy. The interior is dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles illuminating the opulent decor.

CUT TO:

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

A figure sits hunched over a large, leather-bound book, their face obscured by shadows. As they turn the pages, we see flashes of ancient history: wars fought and won, empires risen and fallen.

The figure looks up, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She is EMILIE (28), a direct descendant of the powerful La Roche family.

EMILIE
(whispering to herself)
It's been 800 years...since the last Great Phoenix rose from the ashes. Since the prophecy was fulfilled, and the world was reborn in flames...

CUT TO:

EXT. CHÂTEAU DE LA ROCHE - NIGHT

Emilie stands at a window, gazing out at the Pyrenees Mountains. She is dressed in a flowing black gown, her long hair whipping in the wind.

EMILIE
(to herself)
The fire that runs through my veins...it's calling me home. To the place where it all began...

CUT TO:

INT. CHÂTEAU DE LA ROCHE - NIGHT

Emilie enters a hidden chamber deep within the château, filled with ancient artifacts and relics of her family's past. She approaches a pedestal, upon which rests an ornate box adorned with symbols of fire and flame.

EMILIE
(whispering)
The Inheritance of Flame...the key to my destiny...

As she opens the box, a warm, golden light spills out, illuminating Emilie's face. We see her eyes burning with an inner fire as she holds aloft the artifact within: a small, crystal vial filled with liquid flame.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHÂTEAU DE LA ROCHE - NIGHT

The camera zooms in on the château, as if it's been transformed by Emilie's awakening. Flames erupt from the windows, as if the very walls are alive and burning.

INT. NEXUS PRIME CONTROL ROOM - DAY

We see a group of scientists and engineers, all dressed in jumpsuits, gathered around a holographic display projecting a 3D image of the space station's systems. They're surrounded by rows of computer screens and consoles.

**Dr. Samantha Taylor (40s, curly brown hair)**

(sitting at the center console)

Alright, team. We've completed the final systems checks on the Aurora protocol. Are we ready to initiate?

**Dr. Ryan Lee (30s, messy black hair)**

(nodding)

Yes, ma'am. All green lights.

**Samantha**

(serious expression)

Then let's do this. Run the simulation.

The team works together to execute the protocol. The holographic display flickers and distorts as the Aurora code is activated.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEXUS PRIME SPACE STATION - DAY

As the protocol executes, the station begins to shudder violently. Debris and equipment start flying out into space.

CUT TO:

INT. NEXUS PRIME CONTROL ROOM - LATER

The team rushes back from their consoles, confused and concerned expressions on their faces.

**Samantha**

(determined)

What's happening? We ran the simulations, we're sure this would work...

**Ryan**

(hesitant)

Ma'am... I'm reading some kind of resonance frequency building up. It's like the station is... alive?

The camera cuts to a wide shot as the team watches in horror.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEXUS PRIME SPACE STATION - LATER

As the resonance builds, the station begins to glow with an otherworldly energy. The Aurora protocol has awakened something inside Nexus Prime.

Suddenly, the station lurches violently, throwing equipment and personnel to the ground. The camera shakes as the room becomes chaotic.

We see a team of investigators, led by JENNY TAYLOR (30s), gathered around a large whiteboard.

JENNY
Alright, here's the situation: we've got a high-profile murder victim, 25-year-old social media influencer LUCY PATEL. Body was found in her beachside mansion last night with no signs of forced entry or struggle.

Her partner, MIKE, steps forward.

MIKE
We reviewed the security footage and it looks like Lucy let her killer into her house voluntarily.

SARAH (Jenny's partner)
You mean she knew them?

MIKE
That's what it looks like. Victim had several acquaintances who would have had access to the property. We need to narrow down our list.

Suddenly, a young intern, LUCY (nervously), speaks up.

LUCY
Um, I think I might know something about this case.

JENNY
What do you mean?

LUCY
I was at the beach last night and I saw Lucy arguing with someone on her phone. It looked heated.

The team looks at each other.

MIKE
Can we get a statement from you? What did they look like?

CUT TO:

INT. BEACH - NIGHT

We see LUCY (the intern) walking along the beach, describing what she saw to JENNY and SARAH.

LUCY
...and then Lucy got really angry and slammed her phone down on the table. I was close enough to hear that part of the conversation.

SARAH
What did Lucy say?

LUCY
She said 'If you keep following me, it's going to get serious'. Then she walked away.

The detectives exchange a look.

CUT TO:

INT. H.E.U. BUREAU - DAY

JENNY and her team are reviewing the security footage again. This time they focus on Lucy's phone call.

SARAH
This number was registered under the name 'Alex Green'. Let's dig deeper.

MIKE
I'll see if I can find out who Alex is.

LUCY (nervously)
Wait, doesn't this look like my cousin?

JENNY
What makes you think that?

LUCY
We used to be close but we got into a fight about six months ago. I haven't spoken to him since then.

CUT TO:

INT. H.E.U. BUREAU - LATER

Mike walks in with a photo of Alex Green. The team gasps.

MIKE
Guys, I found something. Alex Green is actually...

The camera pans over a stunning vista of a cityscape before zooming in on our first hero, **Aurora** (25), a young woman with the ability to control light and energy. She's perched atop a skyscraper, gazing out at the city below.

**Aurora** (voiceover)
I've always felt like there was something missing from this world. Something that needed changing. And then I got my powers.

Cut to **Nova**, an older hero with superhuman strength and speed. He's dressed in a sleek black and silver costume, sporting a confident smile.

**Nova**
Hey, kid! Aurora! You're just getting started, huh? Let me give you some advice: the people out there need hope. And we're the ones to bring it.

Aurora nods, determination etched on her face.

**Act II:**

Meanwhile, in a heavily fortified lair, a villainous mastermind known as **Maelstrom** (35) hatches a plan to harness the city's energy and hold it for ransom. His lair is filled with an assortment of henchmen and advanced technology.

**Maelstrom**
(To his right-hand woman, **Ember**)
We've got our eyes on the two most promising young heroes in the city. The Cosmic Crusaders are going to be a game-changer... for us.

Ember smirks, her eyes gleaming with ambition.

Cut back to Aurora and Nova, who have joined forces to tackle a bank heist gone wrong. They spring into action, using their powers to take down henchmen left and right.

**Act III:**

As the heroes close in on Maelstrom's lair, they discover that his plan involves draining the city's energy with an electromagnetic pulse device. Aurora uses her powers to disrupt the signal, but not before Nova is caught off guard by Ember.

The two engage in a fierce battle, their movements lightning-fast and precise.

**Nova**
(to Ember)
You know, I used to think you were just a pretty face...

Ember smirks.
I've got the brains to go with it. And I'm going to take down these heroes once and for all!

The two heroes exchange blows until Nova gains the upper hand. He delivers a crushing blow that sends Ember flying into the lair's control room.

**Act IV:**

With Ember defeated, Aurora and Nova join forces to disable the electromagnetic pulse device. They work together seamlessly, using their powers in tandem to shut down Maelstrom's operation.

As they stand victorious amidst the ruined lair, Nova places a reassuring hand on Aurora's shoulder.

Finally. I'm free.

As he speaks, we see a flash of light envelop him. He raises his hands to shield his eyes, and when they fall away, we see that he's changed. His clothes are now a flowing white robe with intricate silver embroidery. A staff made of living wood is in hand, pulsing with an otherworldly energy.

Greetings, Enchanter. I've been waiting for you.

Great, just what we need. A victim with no history and no leads. This is going to be fun.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Jax and Mike arrive at the police station, where they meet their contact, DETECTIVE LUCAS (40s).

LUCAS
Alright, Jax. The victim's name is Ethan Walker. He was a successful businessman who died under... unusual circumstances.

MIKE
(skeptical)
Unusual?

LUCAS
(nodding)
Let's just say the official story doesn't add up to me.

JAX
(intrigued)
Tell me more.

CUT TO:

INT. WALKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jax and Mike investigate Ethan Walker's office, where they find a cryptic message scrawled on the wall: "You'll never know what I did."

What do you think it means?

(shrugging)
No idea. But we'll find out.

CUT TO:

INT. JAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jax and Mike review the case files, where they discover a surprising connection between Ethan Walker and a notorious con artist, RYDER (30s).

(whispering)
This guy's got a rap sheet longer than my arm.

JAX
(grinning)
And we're going to find out what he's involved in.

You'll never take me down.

Oh, I think we will.

Write a script for the single episode of a Historical Fiction streaming series. The title of the series is `The Lost City`.<start>**Episode 1: "The Discovery"**

**Act I:**

FADE IN:

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

We see a dense jungle, with vines and creepers crawling up massive trees. The sound of insects and birds fills the air.

CUT TO:

INT. CAMPER - DAY

A group of archaeologists, led by Dr. Sophia Patel (30s), are gathered around a map spread out on a table. They're discussing their latest discovery.

SOPHIA
(excitedly)
Guys, I've been studying the ancient texts and I'm convinced that we have a 90% chance of finding the Lost City of Zerzura.

DR. JENKINS (40s)
(skeptical)
Sophia, you know as well as I do that these texts are fragmented and unreliable. We can't just rush into this without more evidence.

SOPHIA
(firmly)
Evidence? We have the writings of the great explorer, Al-Masudi, who claimed to have seen the city with his own eyes. That's enough for me.

CUT TO:

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

The team is on a mission to find the Lost City. They're hiking through the dense jungle, their guide, Amari (20s), leading the way.

AMARI
(looking around nervously)
I told you guys, this place is cursed. We shouldn't be here.

SOPHIA
(reassuringly)
Amari, we've been over this. The city's supposed to be deep in the jungle. We have to keep moving if we want to find it.

As they walk, the camera pans out to reveal a massive stone structure hidden behind the foliage.

**Act II:**

CUT TO:

EXT. LOST CITY - DAY

The team arrives at the entrance of the Lost City. They're awestruck by the sheer scale and grandeur of the ancient architecture.

SOPHIA
(tearfully)
We did it, guys. We actually found it.

DR. JENKINS
(whispering)
This is incredible. The craftsmanship...the engineering...

As they explore the city, they stumble upon a hidden chamber deep within the structure. Inside, they find ancient artifacts and writings that reveal the secrets of Zerzura.

CUT TO:

INT. HIDDEN CHAMBER - DAY

The team gathers around a pedestal, where lies an ancient scroll. Amari begins to unroll it, revealing intricate hieroglyphics.

SOPHIA
(excitedly)
This is it! This is the proof we need!

As they study the scroll, they realize that Zerzura holds secrets not just of history but also of a lost civilization's knowledge and power.

**Act III:**

CUT TO:

EXT. LOST CITY - DAY

The team begins to uncover more artifacts, including ancient texts that hint at a great cataclysm that destroyed the city. They realize that they've stumbled upon something much bigger than just an archaeological find.

SOPHIA
(serious)
Guys, we need to be careful. Whatever happened here...it was catastrophic.

DR. JENKINS
(concerned)
You're talking about a disaster of biblical proportions?

SOPHIA
(nodding)
I think so. We have to get out of here before it's too late.

As the team begins to pack up their gear, Amari suddenly points to something in the distance.

AMARI
(alarmed)
Guys, look! The jungle's moving!

The camera pans out as the jungle floor begins to shake and tremble. The team realizes that they've disturbed a long-dormant force, one that threatens to destroy not just the Lost City but also their own lives.
