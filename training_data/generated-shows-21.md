CUT TO:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

We see JASON (30s), a worn-out truck driver, driving down the highway with his eyes fixed on the road ahead. His phone rings, breaking the silence.

JASON
(answered)
Hey, mom.

VOICE ON PHONE
(over loudspeaker)
Jason, where are you? I've been worried sick about you.

JASON
(sighs)
I'm just a few hours away from home, mom. I'll be there soon.

VOICE ON PHONE
(concerned)
You're not safe out there, Jason. There's been reports of... something happening on this stretch of highway.

JASON
(laughs)
What are you talking about? It's just a bunch of small towns and fields.

VOICE ON PHONE
(deadpan)
That's what they want you to think.

The phone call ends abruptly as the car's GPS system interrupts with an alert.

CUT TO:

Jason pulls over at a rest stop, looking around cautiously. The camera pans out to reveal an eerie, abandoned landscape. Suddenly, his truck's headlights flicker and die.

JASON
(sweat breaks on his forehead)
No...

CUT TO:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Jason frantically tries to restart the engine, but it won't budge. He grabs a flashlight from the glove compartment and steps out of the car, into the darkness.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As Jason walks around the truck, he notices strange symbols etched into the asphalt nearby. They seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy. The camera zooms in on one symbol as it begins to glow brighter.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Jason rushes back inside and grabs his phone. He dials a number, but it goes straight to voicemail. Desperate, he tries calling another number... only to hear the same eerie voice from earlier.

VOICE ON PHONE

You shouldn't be here, Jason.

Suddenly, the engine of Jason's truck roars back to life. The headlights flicker on once more, illuminating a figure standing in front of the car.

We see JACK "THE GUN" MCALLISTER (40s), a rugged, weathered cowboy with a reputation for being one of the fastest draws in the West. He sits at the bar, nursing a whiskey and eyeing the patrons suspiciously.

Suddenly, the swinging doors burst open and in walks MARSHAL JASON BELL (50s), a no-nonsense lawman with a stern expression. He scans the room until his eyes land on Jack.

MARSHAL
( firm but calm )
McAllister. I've been lookin' for you.

JACK
(skeptical)
What can I do for you, Marshal?

MARSHAL
I've got a warrant for your arrest. You're wanted in El Paso for bank robbery.

JACK
(laughing)
That's rich. What makes you think I'm the one who did it?

MARSHAL
A witness placed you at the scene, and I've got a picture of you with the loot.

Jack eyes the Marshal warily, but says nothing.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

The townspeople have gathered to watch the confrontation between Jack and the Marshal. Suddenly, a third figure emerges from the crowd: LUCY (20s), a beautiful and fiery young woman with a sharp tongue and a penchant for trouble.

LUCY
(to the crowd)
Hold up, folks! Don't be so quick to hang McAllister without hearin' his side of the story!

MARSHAL
( firm )
This ain't no trial, miss. This is an arrest warrant.

LUCY
(smartly)
I'm not missin' that point, Marshal. But I also know Jack's reputation as a hero in these parts. He helped stop a gang of outlaws last year and saved half the town from gettin' killed!

The crowd begins to murmur in agreement with Lucy.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

The tension between Jack, the Marshal, and Lucy has reached a boiling point. The air is thick with anticipation as they face off against each other.

JACK
( quietly )
You know I didn't do it, Marshal. But if you're so sure, then bring it on. Let's settle this like men.

The Marshal pulls out his gun and points it at Jack. Lucy rushes forward to stop him.

LUCY
(fiercely)
No! You'll kill him!

MARSHAL
( firm )
I'd rather take my chances with the varmint than let him escape justice.

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows: RICO (30s), the ruthless leader of the gang that robbed the bank in El Paso. He sneers at Jack and the Marshal.

RICO
(sneering)
You'll never take McAllister alive!

With that, Rico draws his gun and fires. The bullet whizzes past Jack's ear, shattering a bottle on the bar.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

The shootout has begun in earnest. Jack and the Marshal are fighting for their lives against Rico and his gang. Lucy rushes forward to help, firing her pistol with precision.

In the chaos of the gunfight, Jack manages to take down several of Rico's henchmen. The Marshal gets a few shots in as well, but Rico remains elusive.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

As the dust settles, we see that Jack has managed to disarm and pin Rico against the bar. The Marshal enters, gun still smoking in his hand.

MARSHAL
( firm )
It's over, McAllister. You can let him go.

JACK
(smirking)
You know I'm not gonna do that, Marshal. This little town just got a whole lot safer with Rico out of commission.

The Marshal nods, seeming to accept Jack's decision. The camera pans out as the townspeople begin to cheer and Lucy rushes forward to congratulate Jack on his victory.

CUT TO:

As the sun sets over Red Rock, we see Jack walking away from the town, a smile on his face and his gun still at his side. He's not going anywhere just yet.

A young woman, LENA (20s), bursts into the room, her eyes locked on Jack's face.

LENA
You're finally taking it off, aren't you?

JACK
(uneasy)
Lena...I don't know if this is a good time...

LENA
(interrupting)
No. It's perfect timing. I've been watching you. I know what you've done.

Jack's eyes dart around the room, as if searching for an escape route.

CUT TO:

The camera pans out to reveal a group of masked vigilantes, each with their own unique abilities and gadgets, gathered in the shadows. They watch as Jack is confronted by Lena.

Jessica is questioning Sarah about her husband's business dealings.

Look, Sarah, I need to know everything. Can you think of anyone who might have wanted your husband dead?

Sarah hesitates before speaking.

SARAH

There was someone. Someone he owed money to...

Jessica's eyes narrow as she grabs her notebook and begins to write.

CUT TO:

Mark is analyzing evidence in the office, while Jessica paces back and forth.

ELINOR

Almost there...

She reaches the grand entrance hall and stops at the bottom of the stairs. Her gaze lifts to the top, where her father, KING AIDAN (55), stands with his back to her.

No, no, no...I won't be swayed. This is madness!

You expect me to betray my own daughter? After all I've done for her?

ELINOR'S FATHER (60s)
With respect, sire...your loyalty lies with your people. Elinor is untested and...

King Aidan rises from his throne, slamming his fist on the armrest.

KING AIDAN
Enough! You speak of my daughter as if she's nothing more than a pawn in our game of power!

The courtiers exchange nervous glances, while Elly watches with growing unease from the sidelines.

CUT TO:

Elly enters her quarters, where she finds her loyal lady-in-waiting, ADELINE (25), packing a small trunk.

ADELINE

Elly...it's time to face reality. Your father is planning to marry you off to secure alliances, not because he wants what's best for you.

ELINOR
(tearfully)
But Adeline, I've always thought...

ADELINE
(firmly)
You were raised as a lady of the court, Elly. You have responsibilities to attend to. Your life will never be your own until you secure your place on the throne.

Elly looks up at Adeline with determination in her eyes.

ELINOR
(coldly)
Then it's settled. I'll do what needs to be done. But I won't let them use me as a pawn without a fight.

ADELINE

LAURA
Welcome to Laugh Track Frenzy! I'm your host, Laura, and we've got an amazing lineup tonight!

The audience cheers politely.

CUT TO:

JASON (20s), a young comedian trying to make it big. He's nervous but eager.

JASON
Thanks, Laura! So, have you guys ever tried to order food at a restaurant with a bunch of accents? It's like, "I'll have the burger... no, not that one... yeah, that one"... (mimics accent) "Zut alors!"

The audience laughs awkwardly.

CUT TO:

TAMMY (40s), a comedian and Laura's best friend. She's loud and boisterous.

TAMMY
Hey, hey! You think you're funny? I went to the doctor the other day and he said, "Don't worry, it'll just be a minor procedure." Minor?! I was in there for three hours!

The audience laughs louder this time.

CUT TO:

LAURA
Alright, alright! Let's get to our headliner. Please welcome... (dramatic pause) ...the infamous comedic genius, Barry Berkowitz!

Barry, played by a gruff-looking comedian in his 50s, ambles up to the mic.

BARRY
Thanks, Laura. So, I was at the park the other day and saw this guy playing fetch with his dog. But here's the thing... the dog wasn't even bringing the ball back! (pauses for comedic effect) I mean, what's the point of that? It's just like me and my ex-wife.

The audience laughs awkwardly again.

CUT TO:

JASON
(sitting in the shadows, looking dejected)

Wait a minute... I've got it! (gets up and approaches the mic)

LAURA
(nervously)
Uh, Jason? You're not supposed to go on after Barry Berkowitz. That's just comedy club protocol.

JASON
(persistent)
No way, Laura! I've got a killer joke that'll top even Barry's best!

Jason clears his throat.

JASON
So, I went to the gym the other day and saw this sign that said... (pauses for comedic effect) ..."Please do not drop weights." Can you believe it? Who needs to tell us not to drop weights? It's like putting a sign on a bar that says "Do not get drunk".

The audience erupts in laughter, finally.

I know we've had some weird cases in the past, but this one takes the cake. Three people dead, all with no signs of struggle or trauma... it's like they just stopped breathing.

JAX
(skeptical)
And you think it's more than just a coincidence?

SAM
(probing)
And you never noticed anything unusual about the victims?

LUCY

Well, there was one thing. Rachel, she seemed really stressed out before her death. She kept talking about a big deal that was going down.

As they move deeper into the house, they come across a hidden safe. Jax manages to crack it open with a crowbar.

INT. SAFE - DAY

Inside the safe, they discover stacks of financial records and documents related to Caldwell Realty. One document in particular catches Sam's eye: a memo detailing a massive embezzlement scheme involving Mike, Jason, and other employees.

JAX

SAM
(determined)
It does indeed.

The camera lingers on the incriminating evidence as Sam and Jax exchange a look of determination. The case has just gotten very deadly.

Your Ladyship. I have come to request an audience with you regarding my knighthood.

LADY ALICE
(skeptical)
Ah, Sir Edmund. You wish to be knighted? Why now?

EDMUND
It is a matter of great importance, Your Ladyship. As a knight, I wish to uphold the chivalric code and protect the innocent. I swear upon my honor that I will do all in my power to bring justice to those who have been wronged.

LADY ALICE
(surprised)
You are driven by conviction, Sir Edmund. But are you prepared for the weight of responsibility? Knighthood is not a game, it's a duty.

EDMUND
(determined)
I am ready, Your Ladyship. I swear upon my honor that I will be true to the Order and uphold its principles.

Lady Alice nods, and one of her advisors hands Edmund a small, intricately designed box.

LADY ALICE
This is a sword, forged from the finest steel in England. It has been blessed by the Church and imbued with the power of justice. I charge you to wield this sword as a symbol of your commitment to protect the weak and vanquish injustice.

Edmund takes the box, opens it, and draws out the sword. As he does so, we see a flashback of his father, a knight who was killed in battle while trying to protect civilians from marauding bandits.

Ah, Sir Edmund! Congratulations on your knighthood!

EDMUND

Thank you, fair Isabella. I promise to use my sword for justice and protect those who cannot defend themselves.

Isabella looks at him with a mixture of admiration and concern.

Be careful, Sir Edmund. There are many dangers in this world. Not everyone will be grateful for your chivalry.

Edmund smiles, nods, and turns back to the castle gates.

As Edmund rides out of the castle gates, he is confronted by a group of bandits, armed to the teeth. They demand that he hand over his horse and sword. Edmund refuses, citing his oath as a knight to uphold justice.

EXT. SEATTLE WATERFRONT - DAY

The camera pans over the picturesque Seattle waterfront, before zooming in on a small, nondescript office building.

CUT TO:

INT. MURDER VICTIM'S OFFICE - DAY

Detective Kate Matthews (35), a no-nonsense, sharp-witted investigator, stands in the office of the victim, JASON HARRIS (42). The room is tidy, with only a few papers out of place.

KATE
(to her partner, Detective Ryan Jenkins)
I'm telling you, Ryan, something's off about this whole thing. Jason was a respected businessman. No one reported any conflicts or issues with him.

RYAN
(skeptical)
Maybe he was involved in some shady dealings we don't know about yet?

KATE
(shaking her head)
That would've come up by now. Jason Harris was a pillar of this community. Everyone loved the guy.

CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Kate and Ryan are questioning JASON'S WIFE, SARAH (35), and his business partner, TOM (40).

SARAH
(tearfully)
I... I had no idea anything was wrong with Jason. He was my rock. We were happy.

TOM
(nervously)
Look, guys, we're both cooperating fully. If there's something going on that I don't know about, please tell me so I can get to the bottom of it.

CUT TO:

INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

Kate is pouring over files and notes from Jason's company.

KATE
(to herself)
Tom's story checks out... but...

Kate's phone rings.

KATE
(answer phone)
Detective Matthews speaking?

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)
We've got a hit on the DNA evidence. We found a hair sample that matches one of our suspects.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Ryan and Kate are in a holding cell, where they find their suspect, LUCY (28), being held by Detective James, who works in a different precinct.

RYAN
(excited)
We finally got something!

LUCY
(smiling sweetly)
You really think I had anything to do with Jason's murder?

JAMES
(shrugging)
Looks that way. You see, Lucy here has quite the alibi... for one of the nights around the time of the murder.

KATE
(everything clicking into place)
I think we've got a bigger picture than we initially thought.

CUT TO:

EXT. SEATTLE WATERFRONT - DAY

Kate and Ryan walk along the waterfront, reflecting on what they know so far.

KATE
(to Ryan)
You see this? This whole area is just a facade of tranquility... like Jason's life. But sometimes you have to look beyond the surface to find the truth.

The camera lingers for a moment as Kate's eyes narrow in thought before zooming out to reveal the beautiful yet deceptive Seattle waterfront.

The camera pans over a picturesque coastal town, with sailboats bobbing in the marina and seagulls soaring overhead.

CUT TO:

INT. TIDES OF JUSTICE OFFICE - DAY

We see a bustling office filled with law enforcement personnel, including our lead character, DETECTIVE JENNY TAYLOR (35), a no-nonsense, sharp-witted investigator. She's reviewing case files on her desk as her partner, DETECTIVE MIKE HARRIS (40), enters the room.

MIKE
(jokingly)
Hey, Jenny, I've got some good news. We just got word that the new DA is going to review our department's budget. Maybe we'll finally get some decent resources to help us keep up with this town's growth.

JENNY
(distracted)
That's not what I'm worried about, Mike. I've been digging into the recent string of burglaries on the waterfront. I think we're dealing with more than just your average thief here.

CUT TO:

EXT. WATERFRONT - DAY

We see a beautiful beachside mansion, its owner, RICHARD PHELPS (50), a wealthy businessman, giving an interview to a local reporter.

REPORTER
...and how do you feel about the recent burglaries in the area?

RICHARD
(concerned)
It's absolutely terrifying. I have valuable artwork and antiques that could be targeted by these thieves. The police need to step up their efforts to catch these perpetrators before it's too late.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Jenny is interviewing a witness, LUCY (28), who claims to have seen the thief in question.

LUCY
(nervously)
I was walking home from work and I saw this person... they looked shifty, like they were trying to avoid being seen. They had a distinctive tattoo on their hand...

JENNY
(intently)
Can you describe the tattoo?

LUCY
(thinking)
It was a small snake coiled around their wrist.

CUT TO:

INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY

Jenny is driving along the coast, thinking about the case when her phone rings. It's Mike.

MIKE (V.O.)
Hey, Jenny, I just got a hit on the fingerprint from the crime scene. Our guy matches someone we've been tracking for months...

CUT TO:

EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

Jenny and Mike arrive at the scene of another burglary. They find evidence that suggests the thief is not just any ordinary burglar.

MIKE
(whispering)
Look at this, Jenny... they're using some kind of advanced lock-picking device...

JENNY
(concerned)
This is more sophisticated than anything I've ever seen before. We need to bring in an expert.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Jenny and Mike meet with a renowned forensic expert, DR. KATHERINE WATSON (45).

DR. WATSON
(analytical)
This device is made of rare materials, Jenny. Whoever created it has some serious expertise in engineering.

CUT TO:

INT. RICHARD PHELPS' MANSION - NIGHT

Jenny and Mike confront Richard about the true nature of the burglaries.

RICHARD
(defensive)
I told you, I'm a victim! I have nothing to do with these crimes!

JENNY
(firmly)
Save it for the DA, Mr. Phelps. We'll get to the bottom of this.

EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

We see a sprawling suburban neighborhood, with neat lawns and perfectly manicured gardens. But amidst the tranquility, a sense of unease settles over the air.

CUT TO:

INT. CRIME SCENE TAPE - DAY

Detective Kate Matthews (40s, sharp jawline, piercing blue eyes) steps out of her car, surveying the scene before her. She's joined by Detective James "Jim" Thompson (50s, rugged good looks), a seasoned veteran with an air of quiet confidence.

KATE
(eyeing the police tape)
What've we got?

JIM
(handing Kate a folder)
Victim's 35-year-old wife, Emily Wilson. Found dead in her bedroom by her husband at 8:45 am this morning.

Kate scans the contents of the folder, taking note of the details.

KATE
(looking up at Jim)
Any signs of forced entry or struggle?

JIM
(shaking his head)
Nope. Looks like a... peaceful death.

Kate raises an eyebrow, intrigued by the phrasing.

CUT TO:

INT. WILSON'S BEDROOM - DAY

We see Emily's body, lying lifeless on her bed. The room is spotless, with not a hair out of place. Kate approaches the bed cautiously, taking in every detail.

KATE
(to Jim)
Looks like she was killed sometime last night. What about witnesses?

JIM
(nodding)
Her husband says they were home alone last night, watching a movie together. But... there's something he's not telling us.

Kate raises an eyebrow, sensing the tension between them.

CUT TO:

INT. WILSON'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

We see James Wilson (35s), Emily's husband, sitting on the couch, looking pale and shaken. Kate approaches him calmly.

KATE
(gentle but firm)
Mr. Wilson, can you walk us through your alibi for last night?

JAMES
(nervously)
Uh... we were watching a movie together. I think it was "The Shawshank Redemption". Yeah, that's right. We just went to bed around 11 pm.

Kate nods, her eyes locked on his.

KATE
(softly)
And you didn't notice anything unusual during the night?

James hesitates, glancing at Jim before responding.

JAMES
(hesitantly)
No... I mean, no, nothing out of the ordinary. We just went to sleep.

Kate presses him further, sensing a crack in his story.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

We see Kate and Jim reviewing the evidence in their offices.

KATE
(studying the file)
What do you make of this?

JIM
(skeptical)
Seems too convenient to me. This guy's hiding something, Kate.

Kate nods, her mind racing with possibilities.

CUT TO:

INT. WILSON'S BACKYARD - DAY

We see a shadowy figure lurking in the shadows, watching Kate and Jim through the windows.

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET ART GALLERY - DAY

We see a bustling street art gallery, filled with vibrant murals and eclectic artwork. The sun beats down on the colorful scene.

CUT TO:

INT. LOS ANGELES STREET ART GALLERY - DAY

We meet our protagonist, DETECTIVE JENNY TAYLOR (35), a sharp and determined investigator in her early 30s. She's investigating a string of art thefts in the city. Jenny is talking to the gallery owner, MARCUS RODRIGUEZ (40).

MARCUS
(frustrated)
This is the fourth piece taken from us in as many weeks, Detective. I don't know what to do.

JENNY
( note-taking )
I understand your concern, Mr. Rodriguez. We'll get to the bottom of this. Can you describe the last piece that was stolen?

MARCUS
(hesitant)
It was...a unique piece by an artist named Zara Vex. A real up-and-comer.

JENNY
(skeptical)
And can I see where it was displayed in the gallery?

Marcus nods, and Jenny follows him to a specific section of the gallery.

CUT TO:

INT. LOS ANGELES STREET ART GALLERY - LATER

Jenny is examining the display case where Zara Vex's art piece was kept. She notices something peculiar about the glass casing.

JENNY
(to herself)
This isn't just any ordinary display case...it's been deliberately tampered with.

Suddenly, Marcus interrupts her thoughts.

MARCUS
(nervously)
Detective, I need to tell you something...

Jenny looks at him expectantly.

MARCUS
( hesitant )
Zara Vex was more than just an artist. She had a personal connection to me.

CUT TO:

INT. JENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Jenny is questioning Marcus further about his relationship with Zara.

MARCUS
( emotionless )
We were in a relationship, but it ended...badly.

JENNY
(intrigued)
And do you have an alibi for the night of the last theft?

Marcus hesitates before responding.

MARCUS
(proudly)
I was with someone...a date. But I can give you her name and number.

Jenny nods, making a note in her book.

CUT TO:

INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY

Jenny is driving to the location of Marcus's alibi. She receives a call from an unknown number.

UNKNOWN VOICE
(menacing)
Zara Vex was more than just an artist...she was a pawn in a much larger game.

Jenny looks puzzled as she hangs up the phone.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET ART GALLERY - DAY

Jenny returns to the gallery, where Marcus is waiting anxiously for her verdict.

MARCUS
( anxious )
What did you find out?

JENNY
(calmly)
We'll get through this together, Mr. Rodriguez.

The camera pans over the small town of Littleton, Colorado, nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. We see a few cars driving down Main Street, but it's quiet and peaceful.

CUT TO:

INT. DETECTIVE JENKINS' OFFICE - NIGHT

Detective Emily Jenkins (35), a no-nonsense woman with short brown hair, sits at her desk, sipping a cup of coffee. Her partner, Detective James Reed (40), enters the office, looking tired.

DETECTIVE REED
(exhaling)
You won't believe what just happened on my way here.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
(skeptical)
Try me.

DETECTIVE REED
(serious)
I was driving home from the precinct when I saw a woman running down the street. She looked frantic, and she kept glancing over her shoulder like someone was chasing her. I pulled over to help her, but by the time I got out of my car, she had disappeared into thin air.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
(surprised)
That's weird. Maybe she just needed a ride or something?

DETECTIVE REED
(shaking his head)
No way. This was different. She looked scared to death.

CUT TO:

EXT. LITTLETON STREET - NIGHT

Detective Jenkins and Detective Reed are interviewing the woman, JESSICA (25), who is visibly shaken.

JESSICA
(tearfully)
I was at a party...and then I saw him. He had eyes that seemed to see right through me. And when I tried to leave, he grabbed my arm and told me something that made my blood run cold...

Jessica glances around nervously before continuing.

JESSICA (CONT'D)
He said, "The Other Side of Midnight is where the real fun begins." And then...and then he disappeared!

Detective Jenkins raises an eyebrow.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
(skeptical)
What does that even mean?

Jessica shakes her head.

CUT TO:

INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - NIGHT

We see a figure, revealed to be the enigmatic and charming RAYMOND (40), watching Jessica on the monitor from his office at the Department of Justice.

RAYMOND

CUT TO:

EXT. LITTLETON STREET - NIGHT

Detective Jenkins and Detective Reed are discussing the case in their car when they receive a call from an unknown number.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
(answered)
Hello?

VOICE ON PHONE

You're getting close, but you have no idea what's coming. Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main if you want to know the truth about The Other Side of Midnight.

The line goes dead.

DETECTIVE REED
(skeptical)
Sounds like a trap to me.

DETECTIVE JENKINS
(determined)
I think it's worth a shot.

CUT TO:

INT. RYDER'S CABIN - NIGHT

We see JASON RYDER (35), a rugged and weathered explorer, pouring over maps and notes on a table. He looks up as his friend, ZOE (28), enters the cabin.

ZOE
Jason, we need to talk about our plan. The Council won't give us permission to venture into the Red Desert without a full crew and supplies.

JASON RYDER
(sighs)
I know, I've tried. But I have reason to believe that there's something out there... something big. And I'm not just talking about treasure.

ZOE
(curious)
What are you saying?

JASON RYDER
(serious)
The Ancients were more advanced than we thought. They left behind technology and knowledge that could change the course of human history.

ZOE
(intrigued)
And you think this tech is in the Red Desert?

JASON RYDER
(nodding)
I do. And I'll be damned if I let it get stolen by the Council or worse, exploited for their own gain.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOONLIT PLAINS - NIGHT

Jason and Zoe ride side by side across the desert. They are followed by a small group of mercenaries, led by a grizzled veteran named VASSILI (45).

You know this is suicide, right?

That's why I love you guys.

The group sets up camp in a small oasis. They are joined by two more members: JAX (22), an expert hacker and tech-savvy kid, and DRENDRA (40), a hardened medic with a mysterious past.

JASON RYDER
(to the team)
Alright, here's what we're looking for. A device that can harness the power of the moon itself. It's said to be hidden deep within the Red Desert.

ZOE
(skeptical)
And you really think this thing exists?

JAX
(excitedly)
I've hacked into ancient databases and found reference to it, Zoe! This is huge!

CUT TO:

EXT. RED DESERT - DAY

The team ventures deeper into the desert, navigating treacherous sand dunes and hostile terrain.

DRENDRA

Jason, I have a bad feeling about this.

Suddenly, they stumble upon an ancient structure hidden beneath the sands. As they explore it, strange energy readings begin to spike on their gear.

CUT TO:

The team discovers a room filled with ancient artifacts and strange machinery. They find themselves at the center of a massive, glowing artifact - the Moonlit Engine.

JASON RYDER
(awed)
By the gods...

Suddenly, they're confronted by a figure in a black cloak - a rogue agent from the Council who will stop at nothing to claim the technology for himself.

CUT TO:

EXT. ANCIENT STRUCTURE - DAY

The team flees as the agent unleashes a hidden security system on them. They fight off hordes of armed mercenaries and barely escape with their lives.

MIA
Jason, we've got a situation downtown.

JASON
(adjusting his headset)
What's the play-by-play?

MIA
(holding up her tablet)
Reports of a massive energy surge emanating from the power plant on 5th and Main. People are getting electrocuted.

JASON
(concern etched on his face)
That's not natural. This could be our guy, "The Overcharger".

CUT TO:

EXT. POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Jason and Mia rush to the scene in their high-tech van, a souped-up 1969 Camaro with flashing lights and retractable gadgets.

Got it.

They leap out of the van and into action. Jason dons his Power Surge suit, while Mia transforms into a speedster with her own high-tech gear.

CUT TO:

INT. POWER PLANT - NIGHT

The Overcharger (30s), a hulking figure in a bulky energy-emitting exosuit, rampages through the plant's control room.

THE OVERCHARGER
(laughing maniacally)
You can't stop me! I've hijacked the entire grid!

JASON
(landing on the catwalk above The Overcharger)
Not so fast. You're taking down the entire city?

The Overcharger turns to face Power Surge, but before he can attack, Mia zips in and disarms him with her agility and quick reflexes.

CUT TO:

EXT. POWER PLANT - NIGHT

With The Overcharger neutralized, Jason and Mia stand victorious as the energy surge dissipates.

JASON
(to Mia)
Good work out there!

MIA
(smiling mischievously)
Anytime, Power Surge. We make a killer team.

Jason gives her a proud smile, but it's short-lived. A shadowy figure watches from the shadows, monitoring their actions with an air of disdain.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

As Jason and Mia return to their lair, they receive a message on their comms device from an unknown number.

VOICE ON COMMS DEVICE
You may have stopped The Overcharger, Power Surge, but I'm just getting started. You're no match for the real power at play here.

Jason's grin falters as he turns to Mia with concern etched on his face.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Jessica walks in and takes a seat at the bar, ordering a coffee from the friendly barista, MIKE (25). As they chat, we see flashes of Jessica's past relationships go by on her phone.

MIKE
You okay? You look like you've lost your last dollar.

JESSICA
(sighing)
Just my flight. Again. It's been delayed.

Well, at least it gives us a chance to get to know each other.

Jessica smiles, and Mike starts telling her about his own travel woes.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

As Jessica finishes her coffee, she looks up to see MIKE walking over to her with a smile on his face.

MIKE
Hey, I'm going to grab some more work done at the coffee shop down the street. You want to come? It's always nice to have some company while working.

Jessica hesitates for a moment before agreeing.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

As they work and chat, Jessica finds herself feeling more and more comfortable around Mike. They talk about everything from their jobs to their families.

JESSICA
(laughing)
I swear, my mom's the most embarrassing person I know.

My mom's worse! She still makes me wear my high school graduation tie when we're out together.

Jessica playfully rolls her eyes as they continue to banter back and forth.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

As the day wears on, Jessica suggests they take a walk outside. They stroll through the park, enjoying the beautiful scenery around them.

MIKE
(serious)
So, what's going on? You seemed really stressed out earlier.

Jessica hesitates before opening up to Mike about her recent breakups and fears of being alone.

JESSICA
(her voice trembling)
I don't know... I just feel like I'm in between heartbeats. Like, I have this feeling that something's missing, but I don't know what it is or how to fix it.

Mike listens intently as Jessica pours her heart out to him.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - LATER

As they walk back towards the airport, Mike takes Jessica's hand in his own. She looks up at him with surprise and curiosity.

Kaito, we've got a problem. One of our own has gone rogue.

KAITO

Which one?

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)
YAMADA. He's been using our resources to fund his own vigilante operation.

Long.

Lina hands Kaito a folder containing classified information and photos of various high-tech gadgets.

LINA

You're going to need this. There's more where Yamada came from.

KAITO

What's going on, Lina? Who are you people?

Jenny, we've got a case for you. Looks like a real doozy.

TOM

Actually, this one's a little different. Lady walks into the station and reports her husband missing. Claims he was last seen leaving their upscale townhouse two nights ago... and she says she didn't do him in.

Jenny raises an eyebrow as Tom hands her a file.

As they arrive at the townhouse, Jenny's trained eyes scan the premises for any signs of foul play or suspicious activity. Inside, they find LUCY WILSON (30), a stunning woman with impeccable taste, frantically pacing back and forth in the living room.

(nervously)
He's a lawyer at Wilson & Co. He was working late last night when I last spoke to him.

Jenny takes note of Lucy's composure, thinking it might be an act.

**Act III:**

As the investigation unfolds, Jenny and Tom uncover some interesting details about Robert Wilson (LUCY'S husband). It seems he was involved in a contentious divorce case with his estranged wife, who happens to be one of his clients. The stakes are high, and Jenny starts to suspect that this missing person's case might not be what it initially seemed.

Jenny decides to dig deeper into Lucy's past, talking to her friends and colleagues. It's clear she's hiding something. Tom, however, is more sympathetic to Lucy's plight, convinced that she's genuinely distraught about her husband's disappearance.

**Act IV:**

As the investigation reaches a boiling point, Jenny receives a cryptic message from an anonymous source hinting at Lucy's involvement in Robert's disappearance. This sets off alarm bells for our protagonist, who is now fully invested in uncovering the truth.

With tensions escalating between them, Jenny and Tom find themselves on opposite sides of the case. As they debate what to do next, it becomes clear that nothing is as it seems in this seemingly perfect marriage.

**Act V:**

The episode ends with a twist, leaving viewers wondering if Lucy is indeed capable of such deceit or if there's more to the story. Jenny, determined to uncover the truth, receives another message from the same anonymous source, leading her down a dark path that promises to shake everything she thought she knew about this case – and herself.

(to her friend, KIRA)
I'm telling you, I saw it with my own eyes. The Pale Mountains hold secrets we can't even begin to imagine.

KIRA
(skeptical)
You mean the stories of our ancestors? The ones about the ancient civilizations that once thrived here?
