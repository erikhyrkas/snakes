AGENT JENKINS (35), the leader of the group, stands up.

JENKINS
Alright, let's go over the briefing one more time. We've got two new witnesses coming in today.

Witnesses 17 and 18. They're going to be taking on new identities as part of the program.

JENKINS
So, Jessica and Tyler... you've both been witnesses to a rather serious crime. Can you tell me what happened?

Jessica speaks up.

JESSICA
It was a robbery at the convenience store where I work. The perps were armed and...

Tyler interrupts her.

TYLER
And they shot my dad.

JENKINS
I see. And have either of you been in contact with anyone from law enforcement or the media about this incident?

Jessica shakes her head.

JESSICA
No, we've kept it quiet for now. We're just trying to... move on.

CUT TO:

INT. WITNESS PROTECTION AGENCY - DAY

The agents are discussing the new witnesses in a conference room.

RODRIGUEZ
So, what's the plan here?

JENKINS
We'll be creating new identities for them and relocating them to a safe house. From there, they'll have 30 days to get settled before we'll start building their new lives.

AGENT MURPHY (32) speaks up.

MURPHY
I'm not sure I agree with this one. These two seem pretty young to be in witness protection.

Just do your job, Murphy.

We meet our protagonist, EMILY (28), a young journalist, as she enters the mansion with her producer, MIKE (40). Emily is researching a story about the house's dark history.

MIKE
(whispering)
Okay, Em, the rumors say this place has been abandoned for decades. The owners died in a fire, and it's been locked up ever since.

EMILY
(curious)
And what happened to the family?

MIKE
(hesitant)
Rumors are that they were... haunted by something. Some people think it was just their own guilt and trauma, but...

Emily shrugs, unimpressed. Mike hands her a recorder.

MIKE
(serious)
Just remember, this is all off the record. We need to get out of here before sunrise.

As Emily begins to explore the house, she starts to feel an unsettling presence. She sets up her equipment and begins recording.

CUT TO:

INT. BLACKWOOD HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Emily discovers a hidden room deep in the house. Inside, she finds old newspapers, police reports, and newspaper clippings about the Blackwood family's tragic fate: the father was accused of murdering his wife and children in their sleep; the mother took her own life shortly after; and the son disappeared without explanation.

As Emily reads through the documents, we hear whispers on the recording she made earlier. At first, it sounds like static, but then the words become clear:

"I... did it."

The camera cuts to a series of flashbacks, showing the family's troubled history and the events leading up to their downfall. As the story unfolds, Emily becomes increasingly entangled in the mystery.

Emily listens to her recordings again, this time with newfound understanding. The whispers on the tape seem to be coming from the son, who survived but was driven mad by his family's dark legacy.

Suddenly, Emily hears a noise behind her and turns around. She sees the son's old room, now restored to its former glory. A single word is scrawled on the wall: "Mine."

The camera zooms out as Emily realizes that she has become trapped in Blackwood House, reliving the echoes of the family's tragedy.

As the brunch service begins to wind down, Jen takes a short break to grab a cup of coffee and catch up with her friends, SARAH (29) and EMILY (26), who are working as servers.

SARAH
(squeezing Jen's arm)
I'm so jealous you get to wear that adorable country club uniform all day. I'm stuck in my waitress skirt for the next eight hours.

JEN
(laughing)
Hey, at least you don't have to deal with me trying to corral a bunch of sugar-high kids all afternoon.

EMILY
(jumping into the conversation)
Speaking of which, has anyone seen Mike's hair today? It looks like he stuck his finger in a socket.

The three friends giggle as they continue their chat.

Sorry about this. I hate these crowded trains.

YUI
(smiling)
Yeah, me too. But at least we're not on the Shinjuku line.

Sheriff Burns?

JASON

It's been... years. I reckon you don't know who I am.

I'm afraid not. What's your name, friend?

MIKE: Dude, have you seen this flyer? We've got to go camping!

JASON: Are you insane? Camping? That's like voluntarily going into a hostage situation with squirrels.

MIKE: Come on, it'll be fun! We can bring our guitars and sing around the campfire.

JASON: (skeptical) You want me to leave the comforts of my air-conditioned bedroom for... bugs and... dirt?

MIKE: That's the point! It's like a reboot. A digital detox from all the stupid stuff we do every day.

JASON: (sarcastically) Oh, sure, because nothing says "digital detox" like bringing a phone with 4G capabilities to a remote campsite.

SARAH: (laughing) That's not a thing, Jason.

MIKE: (frustrated) Can someone please just light the campfire already?!

I think it might have to do with us. With our abilities.

FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED FORTRESS - DAY

The camera pans over a ruined fortress, once a stronghold against an ancient evil, now reclaimed by nature. We see our protagonist, Kael (35), standing atop the crumbling walls, gazing out at the desolate landscape.

KAEL
(to himself)
It's been 20 years since...since it all fell apart. I've spent my whole life running from this place, trying to outrun the memories. But there's something about returning that makes me feel...alive again.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED TUNNEL - DAY

Kael enters a hidden tunnel system within the fortress walls. He navigates through dusty corridors and ancient stone carvings, making his way deeper into the heart of the complex.

KAEL
(whispering)
It's supposed to be a safe haven...but I have my doubts.

Suddenly, he hears footsteps echoing off the walls. Kael draws his sword, prepared for battle.

CUT TO:

INT. SECRET CHAMBER - DAY

Kael bursts into a hidden chamber, revealing a group of skilled fighters, armed and armored. They're surrounded by ancient artifacts and maps of a mysterious realm.

LEADER (Lysandra, 30)
(approaching Kael with caution)
Who are you? What brings you to our sanctuary?

KAEL
(lowering his sword)
I'm just passing through. I didn't mean to intrude.

LYSANDRA
(eyes narrowing)
You're not from around here...and you've got a familiar look about you. The look of someone who's been here before.

Kael hesitates, unsure how much to reveal.

CUT TO:

INT. SECRET CHAMBER - FLASHBACK

A younger Kael (20) appears in a flashback sequence, fighting alongside Lysandra and their fellow Brigade members against an overwhelming horde of dark creatures. The memories flood back, and for a moment, Kael is transported back to his past.

FADE TO BLACK.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED FORTRESS - DAY

Kael finds himself standing outside the fortress once more, but this time with Lysandra by his side.

LYSANDRA
(serious)
The last time we stood together...we made a pact to rebuild and defend our world against the coming darkness. That day never came. But it's here now.

(determined)
It's not too late. We can still make a difference.

Lysandra nods in agreement, and together they lead their team into action.

LYSANDRA
( resolute)
Then let's stand as one, for what we believe in.

The team rallies behind their leaders, forging a united front against the coming darkness.

Sarah walks into the precinct, flanked by Detectives James "Jim" REED (40s) and Emily PATEL (30s). They look up from their files as Sarah approaches.

Hey, Sarah! We were just about to call you in for a meeting with Captain Lewis.

SARAH
(serious)
Save it, Jim. I'm here about the case. What do we know?

EMILY
(nervously)
Sarah, we've been working on this for weeks...

JIM
(interrupting)
Emily's right, Sarah. We need to stick to procedure here.

CAPTAIN LEWIS (50s), a seasoned and no-nonsense officer, walks into the room.

CAPTAIN LEWIS
(to Jim and Emily)
Alright, alright. Let's get down to business. Detective Reed?

JIM
(nervously)
We've found some discrepancies in the victim's alibi...

SARAH
(cutting him off)
Discrepancies? I thought we were looking for a killer.

CAPTAIN LEWIS
(sternly)
Sarah, this is standard procedure. We need to cover all our bases.

EMILY
(whispering to Jim)
She's not going away until she gets what she wants...

JIM
(whispering back)
Tell me about it...

**CUT TO:**

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sarah paces in her small apartment, looking at a computer screen with a hacking tool open.

SARAH
(to herself)
I know you're watching me... I can feel it...

Suddenly, her phone rings. She picks up, and we see a grainy video feed of someone's face on the screen.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (over phone)
You think you're so smart, don't you?

SARAH
(firmly)
I'm just trying to do my job.

VOICE
(smirking)
Well, good luck with that...

Wellington (played by Tom Hiddleston) paces back and forth in front of a large map of the battlefield. His advisors, including his trusted friend and confidant, Lord FitzRoy Somerset (played by Matthew Goode), look on with concern.

WELLINGTON
(to FitzRoy)
We need to hold our ground at La Haye Sainte. If we lose that farm, Napoleon's cavalry will break through and cut us in two.

FITZROY
(serious)
Sir, I agree, but our men are exhausted. We can't keep pushing them into the fray.

WELLINGTON
(resolute)
We have no choice. This is it, FitzRoy. The fate of Europe hangs in the balance.

The battle rages on, the two armies locked in a desperate struggle for control. Wellington's troops begin to tire, but he refuses to yield.

WELLINGTON

As the sun begins to set, Napoleon's forces make one final push against the British lines. The outcome hangs in the balance...

CUT TO:

EXT. DRY LAKE BED - DAY

The camera pans over a vast, arid landscape as a dusty convoy truck rumbles along a dirt path. Inside, we see JACK (35), a ruggedly handsome ex-Special Forces operative, and his trusted companion, SARAH (28), a skilled hacker.

JACK
(to Sarah)
Alright, what's the situation?

SARAH
(eyeing her phone)
Intel suggests our target is hiding in the nearby canyon system. But we have company - a rival extraction team, led by Victor Vex.

Jack nods as they approach the edge of the dry lake bed. A figure emerges from the distance, approaching them.

VICTOR VEX (40s), charismatic and menacing

VICTOR
Well, well. Jack Harris. I've heard so much about you. You're a hard man to pin down.

JACK
(skeptical)
Vex. What do you want?

VICTOR
(leaning against the truck)
Same as you - to claim the prize inside that canyon system. A rare artifact known as the Inferno Point.

SARAH
(concerned)
Jack, I've got something here...

Sarah shows Jack her phone screen displaying a thermal image of a heavily armed team infiltrating the canyon from another angle.

JACK
(grimly)
Looks like we have multiple players in this game. Time to adapt.

CUT TO:

INT. CANYON - DAY

The trio ventures into the labyrinthine canyon system, navigating through narrow tunnels and crevices. As they proceed, they encounter an increasingly deadly assortment of traps set by previous treasure hunters.

SARAH
(hacking away at a keypad)
Jack, I'm getting close to bypassing this security system...

JACK
(shouldering his rifle)
Sarah, get ready for some unwanted company. We have hostiles on our six.

The sound of gunfire erupts from the depths of the canyon as they take down their pursuers. Jack dispatches them with swift precision, but one opponent proves to be a particularly skilled adversary...

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED CAVE - DAY

As Jack battles this deadly foe (KAZAN), his skills are matched by Kazan's tenacity and cunning. The fight spills out into the open cave, with both combatants exchanging blows.

SARAH
(darting in to help)
Jack!

Sarah intervenes just as Kazan lands a devastating kick that sends Jack crashing to the ground.

KAZAN
(sneering)
You're no match for me, Harris. You'll never make it out of this canyon alive.

JACK
(groaning in pain)
Not if I have anything to say about it...

As Sarah helps Jack rise to his feet, he summons a burst of adrenaline and sends Kazan tumbling into the darkness. The rival extraction team retreats, forced to regroup.

CUT TO:

EXT. CANYON - DAY

With their pursuers dealt with, Jack and Sarah finally reach the heart of the canyon system. They stumble upon an ancient pedestal holding the Inferno Point artifact, but they're not alone...

A massive shockwave starts building as Victor Vex's team closes in.

JACK
(serious)
Looks like our playtime is over, Sarah. Time to get out of here.

As they turn to leave with the Inferno Point, a blinding explosion rips through the canyon, engulfing everything in its path.

We see JAX (28), the leader of Omega Spire, standing in front of a holographic display. He's surrounded by his teammates: ZARA (25), a genius hacker; LUCAS (30), an expert martial artist; and EMILY (27), a skilled engineer.

JAX
(to the team)
Alright, we have confirmation that the notorious thief, THE FOX, has stolen a highly classified device from the city's research facility.

ZARA
(nervously)
I'm trying to track her location, but she's using some kind of advanced cloaking technology.

LUCAS
(serious)
We need to move in ASAP. We can't let her sell that tech to the highest bidder.

EMILY
(concerned)
Guys, I've been running simulations, and if The Fox gets away with this device... it could give her access to our entire city's infrastructure.

JAX
(determined)
Alright, here's the plan. Zara, can you hack into the city's surveillance system to get us an updated location?

ZARA
(nodding)
On it.

LUCAS
(to Emily)
You're with me on this one. We'll take point and try to contain The Fox.

EMILY
(resolute)
Got it.

And you keep digging, see if you can find out what she's planning to do with the device.

ZARA

I'm on it.

The team is in action, racing through the streets in a sleek Omega Spire vehicle. Lucas and Emily are dressed in high-tech suits, ready for battle.

Remember, we need to take her alive. We can't let The Fox get away with this device.

EMILY
(determined)
Got it.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

The team arrives at the location where The Fox has set up a makeshift lab. They sneak inside, and suddenly, The Fox appears on the catwalk above them.

THE FOX
(smirking)
Well, well, well... look what we have here.

LUCAS
(to Emily)
Take point!

EMILY
(nodding)
Got it.

The team springs into action, with Lucas taking down several henchmen. Emily uses her suit's enhanced strength to grab The Fox and lift her off the ground.

ZARA
(voiceover)
I've hacked into the surveillance system... I'm tracking...

Suddenly, a blast of energy hits Zara's device, knocking her out.

CUT TO:

EXT. OMEGA SPIRE - DAY

Jax rushes back to the Spire with Emily and Lucas in tow.

EMILY
(concerned)
Zara was tracking The Fox's location when she got hit by that energy blast...

LUCAS
(determined)
We need to find out what just happened and stop The Fox before it's too late.

JAX
(determined)
Agreed. We'll regroup, come up with a new plan, and take back the device.

**Act I:**

(The camera pans over a small, cluttered apartment. We see JESSICA, a disheveled and anxious young woman in her mid-twenties, frantically searching through a stack of VHS tapes on the coffee table.)

JESSICA: (to herself) Where did I put that tape? It was right here...

(She looks around the room, taking in the clutter and the worn furniture. We see flashes of old photographs and movie posters on the walls, hinting at Jessica's love for film and nostalgia.)

**Act II:**

(Jessica continues to search through the tapes, muttering to herself about finding a specific recording from her childhood. Suddenly, she finds an old VHS tape with a label that reads "Mom & Me - 1995". She looks up, a mix of excitement and fear on her face.)

JESSICA: (whispering) Oh no...

(She hesitates for a moment before inserting the tape into an ancient VCR. We see a static-filled TV screen flicker to life as the tape begins to play.)

**Act III:**

(The footage shows Jessica's mother, CAROLINE, speaking directly to the camera in a warm and loving tone. She talks about her relationship with Jessica, sharing tender moments from their time together. As we watch, it becomes clear that this is not just any ordinary recording - it's a message from Caroline to Jessica, recorded before her untimely death when Jessica was just a child.)

CAROLINE (on tape): Sweetie, I know you're struggling right now. But I want you to remember all the good times we had together... the laughter, the adventures...

(As Caroline speaks, we see flashbacks of their memories - moments that Jessica thought were lost forever. The footage is interspersed with images of Jessica's current life, her struggles and fears.)

**Act IV:**

(As the tape reaches its end, Jessica breaks down in tears. We see a montage of her processing this revelation, piecing together fragments of memory and emotion. Suddenly, she looks up at the camera, and we're left wondering...)

JESSICA: (smiling) Mom?

(The screen fades to black as Jessica's voice echoes through the silence.)

**Act V:**

(We hear a faint hum in the background - the sound of a TV on, but with no image. The episode ends with an unsettling thought: what if there were more tapes? More secrets? And who is watching?)<end>

We see a small, dusty town in the middle of nowhere. The buildings are worn and weathered, with broken windows and crumbling facades. A lone rider, JACK (30s), rides into town on a tired horse. He's dressed in a simple outfit, with a wide-brimmed hat and a leather duster.

JACK
(to himself)
Another one-bit town. Wonder what kind of trouble I'll find here.

Jack ties up his horse outside the local saloon and steps inside. The patrons look him up and down before returning to their drinks and games.

CUT TO:

INT. SALOON - DAY

Jack takes a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey from the bartender, SAM (40s).

SAM
What brings you to Lonesome Valley?

JACK
Just passing through. You got any rooms available?

SAM
Yeah, one room left. It's not the Ritz, but it's free.

As Jack pays for his drink and takes his room key, a commotion erupts outside. A group of tough-looking men, led by a burly man named GRISWOLD (40s), begin to cause trouble in front of the saloon.

CUT TO:

EXT. SALOON - DAY

Jack steps out into the chaos, eyeing Griswold and his crew. The townsfolk scurry for cover as Jack faces off against the group.

GRISWOLD
(sneering)
You think you're some kind of hero, don't you? Coming in here and thinking you can take on us?

JACK
(calmly)
Just trying to mind my own business.

Griswold spits at Jack's feet before turning to leave with his crew. As they ride off, Jack notices a young woman, EMILY (20s), watching the scene from the doorway of her family's general store across the street.

EMILY
(to herself)
That man... he's got fire in him. Maybe he can help us.

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jack sits on the bed, sipping his whiskey and staring out the window at the stars. He thinks back to his past, a time when he was more than just a lone rider.

JACK
(to himself)
You used to be a man with a purpose... now you're just a ghost drifting from one town to another.

As Jack falls into a troubled sleep, we see a shadowy figure watching him from the darkness outside his room. The figure vanishes before Jack stirs.

We see JAX entering an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. He meets up with his team: LENA (20s, tech expert), and VICTOR (40s, former soldier).

LENA
(looking at her comms device)
Jax, we're getting a lock on the anomaly.

VICTOR
(skeptical)
What's going on?

JAX
(serious)
We've got a rift. Time is bleeding into our reality.

CUT TO:

The team briefs their leader, ZARA (40s), on the situation.

ZARA
(concerned)
Okay, here's what we know: a rift has opened in New York City, and it's growing by the minute.

LENA
(scouting data on her comms device)
I'm tracking multiple timelines converging onto this point...

JAX
(grim)
That means anyone who crosses through will lose an hour of their life forever.

VICTOR
(outraged)
Not if we can stop them, you mean.

ZARA
(firmly)
Alright, team. This is it. We go in, we find the source of this rift, and we close it before it's too late.

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

The Time Reavers suit up and head into the fray. They navigate through a swirling vortex, dodging debris and bodies. Suddenly, they see a young woman, MAY (20s), standing at the edge of the anomaly.

MAY
(desperate)
Help me! I don't want to lose an hour!

JAX
(urgently)
We'll get you out! Just stay with us!

The team leaps into action, fighting off rogue time agents and trying to guide May through the vortex.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

As they fight their way deeper into the anomaly, the team discovers a shocking truth: May is actually a future version of Lena's sister, who went missing five years ago.

LENA
(horrified)
No... it can't be...

MAY
(tearfully)
I'm so sorry. I had to do this. My timeline is dying. This one is the only chance for humanity to survive.

The Time Reavers reach the heart of the anomaly: a glowing portal that seems to be drawing in time from all directions.

JAX

We can't let it spread!

VICTOR
(focused)
I'll take care of this. You guys get May outta here!

CUT TO:

As the team fights their way back through the warehouse, they're ambushed by rogue time agents.

MAY
(grimly)
It's okay... I've got an idea...

May uses her knowledge of the anomaly to create a small wormhole that transports them through space-time, right behind Victor as he confronts the source of the rift: a mysterious figure known only as "The Architect".

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

As the Time Reavers face off against The Architect, we see Jax's memories flash back to his own past: losing an hour with every mission.

JAX
(to himself)
I've lost count of how many times I've done this...

Suddenly, Victor leaps forward and takes down The Architect. As the team regroups, we see May standing alongside them, looking relieved but also worried.

MAY

JASON: (looking up from his laptop)

No, no, it's not weird at all. Go ahead.

I just wanted you to know that... seeing the two of you together today was really inspiring for me as an artist. And as a person...

Max listens attentively, his tone warm and inviting.

EXT. STARBLAZERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

The camera pans over a sleek, high-tech facility in the heart of the city. Suddenly, a massive explosion rocks the building.

CUT TO:

INT. STARBLAZERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

We see JAXON (28), a young and cocky superhero, leaping into action. He's dressed in a high-tech suit that shimmers with energy.

JAXON
(to his teammates)
Alright, guys! We've got a situation on our hands!

ZAREK (30), a grizzled veteran and Jaxon's second-in-command, nods grimly.

ZAREK
Get the others here. I'll handle the perimeter.

CUT TO:

EXT. STARBLAZERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Jaxon bursts out of the building, his suit glowing with energy as he faces off against a massive, robotic creature.

JAXON
(to himself)
Looks like we've got a new player in town...

The robot lunges at Jaxon, who dodges and weaves around its attacks with ease. He retaliates with a barrage of energy blasts, but the robot absorbs them without flinching.

CUT TO:

INT. STARBLAZERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Zarek's voice echoes through the comms system as he coordinates the team's response.

ZAREK
(to Jaxon)
Jax, we're reading a unique energy signature from the robot. It might be more than just a simple drone...

JAXON
(into comms)
Roger that, Zarek! Get me some data on this thing!

CUT TO:

EXT. STARBLAZERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

As Jaxon continues to battle the robot, three other Starblazers arrive on the scene.

LUNA (25), a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, leaps into action alongside Jaxon.

LUNA
(to Jaxon)
I've got this, Jax! You focus on taking down that thing!

Jaxon nods and focuses his energy blasts on the robot's core. Luna joins him in mid-air, using her agility to dodge the robot's attacks as she strikes from unexpected angles.

CUT TO:

INT. STARBLAZERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

The Starblazers' computer systems flicker back online, revealing a shocking truth.

ZAREK
(to Jaxon)
Jax, we've got a problem... The robot's energy signature? It's a replica of the original Aurora Matrix... the one that was thought to be lost in the incident at New Arcadia...

CUT TO:

EXT. STARBLAZERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

As the Starblazers continue their battle against the robot, it suddenly unleashes a devastating blast of energy.

JAXON
(to Luna)
Get out! We need to fall back!

The two heroes leap away just in time, as the explosion rocks the surrounding area. As they regroup with Zarek and the others, they realize that this is only the beginning...

**EPISODE 1: "RIFT"**

FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY

We see a sprawling research facility in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but desolate wasteland and broken machinery. The once-state-of-the-art equipment now lies rusted and still.

CUT TO:

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

A lone figure, DR. SOFIA JENKINS (30s), a brilliant scientist with short, curly hair and an expression of deep concern, frantically checks the readings on a series of holographic screens projected in front of her. She's surrounded by rows of computer terminals, research papers stacked haphazardly across workbenches.

SOFIA
(whispering to herself)
It can't be... The rift has collapsed...

Suddenly, the lights flicker and die. Sofia stumbles in the darkness, nearly falling over as she desperately tries to regain her footing.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY

A strange, swirling phenomenon erupts from the heart of the facility. Energy pulses through the air as a shimmering rift forms, connecting this world to... somewhere else? The ground begins to shudder and shake.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

Sofia frantically tries to reboot the main computer system, but it refuses to come back online. She checks her own comms device, only to find that there's no signal. Panic starts to set in as she realizes she's completely cut off from the outside world.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY

More and more personnel begin pouring out of the facility's doors, fleeing in a state of panic as the rift expands. Some try to take shelter in nearby vehicles, while others simply run for their lives.

Sofia watches this chaos unfold from within the lab, frozen with fear.

CUT TO:

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

A team of scientists and engineers - MARK (30s), a rugged outdoorsman; LUCY (20s), a brilliant mathematician; and MARCUS (40s), the gruff but lovable facility manager - stumble into the lab, having managed to escape the chaos outside.

MARK
(terrified)
Sofia... what's happening?

LUCY
(nervously)
We have to get out of here. We can't stay near the rift.

MARCUS
(grumbling)
Not when I've got a family waiting for me at home...

SOFIA
(calmly, but with an edge)
You're not thinking this through. If we leave now, who's going to help those people? Who's going to... contain this?

The team exchanges worried glances as the rift continues to grow in power.

FADE OUT.<end>
