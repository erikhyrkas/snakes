Merge two sorted lists in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that merges two sorted lists:
```python
from typing import List, Any

def merge_sorted_lists(list1: List[Any], list2: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.

    Args:
        list1 (List[Any]): The first sorted list.
        list2 (List[Any]): The second sorted list.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: A new sorted list containing all elements from both input lists.
    """

    # Combine the two lists into one
    merged_list = list1 + list2

    # Use the built-in sorted function to sort the combined list
    merged_list.sort()

    return merged_list
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `+` operator is used to combine the two input lists into a single list.
2. The `sort()` method is called on the combined list to sort it in ascending order.

Note: This implementation uses the built-in sorted function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). If you need a more efficient implementation for large lists, you can use a merge sort algorithm with a time complexity of O(n).

Example usage:
```python
list1 = [1, 3, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 6]

merged_list = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
print(merged_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
<end>Rotate list by k positions in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that performs the task:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def rotate_list(items: List[Any], k: int) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Rotates a list of items by k positions.

    Args:
        items (List[Any]): The list to be rotated.
        k (int): The number of positions to rotate the list by.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: The rotated list.
    """
    
    # Adjust k if it's larger than the length of the list
    k = k % len(items)
    
    # Return the last k elements followed by the rest
    return items[-k:] + items[:-k]
```

Here's an example usage:

```python
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(rotate_list(items, 2))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

In this code, we're taking advantage of Python's list slicing feature to return the desired rotated list. The expression `items[-k:]` gets the last k elements from the list, and `items[:-k]` gets all elements except the last k ones. When we combine these two expressions with a `+`, we get the rotated list.
<end>Convert HH:MM:SS to seconds in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that converts a time string in the format `HH:MM:SS` to seconds:

```python
def hms_to_seconds(time_str: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert a time string in the format HH:MM:SS to seconds.

    Args:
        time_str (str): A time string in the format HH:MM:SS.

    Returns:
        int: The equivalent number of seconds.
    """
    h, m, s = map(int, time_str.split(':'))
    return h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
```

Example use cases:

```python
print(hms_to_seconds('01:30:00'))  # Output: 5400
print(hms_to_seconds('12:45:10'))  # Output: 46570
print(hms_to_seconds('00:00:05'))  # Output: 5
```
<end>Implement Floyd-Warshall algorithm in Python.<start>Here is the Python function implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:

```python
from typing import List

def floyd_warshall(graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    This function implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find shortest paths 
    between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

    Args:
        graph (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the adjacency matrix of the graph.
            Each row and column index represents a vertex, and each cell at position (i, j) 
            contains the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If there is no edge between two vertices,
            the weight should be infinity.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A 2D list representing the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices.
            Each cell at position (i, j) contains the length of the shortest path from vertex i to vertex j.
            If there is no path from vertex i to vertex j, the value will be infinity.
    """

    # Create a copy of the input graph
    dist = [[val for val in row] for row in graph]

    # Initialize the number of vertices (assuming it's square matrix)
    num_vertices = len(graph)

    # Iterate over all vertices as potential intermediate points
    for k in range(num_vertices):
        # Relax edges by considering intermediate vertex k
        for i in range(num_vertices):
            for j in range(num_vertices):
                dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])

    return dist

# Example usage:
graph = [
    [0, 5, float('inf'), 10],
    [float('inf'), 0, 3, float('inf')],
    [float('inf'), float('inf'), 0, 1],
    [float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf'), 0]
]

shortest_paths = floyd_warshall(graph)

# Print the shortest distances
for row in shortest_paths:
    print(row)
```

This function uses a simple iterative approach to relax edges by considering intermediate vertices. The `floyd_warshall` function takes a weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix and returns the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices.

Note that this implementation assumes a weighted graph with positive edge weights, where each cell in the input graph is either a non-negative integer (the weight of the corresponding edge) or infinity.
<end>Find longest palindromic substring in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that uses a helper function to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string:

```python
def expand_around_center(s, left, right):
    """
    Helper function to expand around the center of potential palindrome.
    
    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
        left (int): Left index of the current character.
        right (int): Right index of the current character.
    
    Returns:
        str: The longest palindromic substring starting from the given indices.
    """
    while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
        left -= 1
        right += 1
    return s[left + 1:right]


def longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string.
    
    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
    
    Returns:
        str: The longest palindromic substring.
    """
    if not s:
        return ""
    
    max_length = 1
    start = 0
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Odd length palindrome
        odd_length_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i)
        if len(odd_length_palindrome) > max_length:
            start = i - (len(odd_length_palindrome) - 1) // 2
            max_length = len(odd_length_palindrome)
        
        # Even length palindrome
        even_length_palindrome = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)
        if len(even_length_palindrome) > max_length:
            start = i - (len(even_length_palindrome) // 2 - 1)
            max_length = len(even_length_palindrome)
    
    return s[start:start + max_length]
```

This solution works by treating each character in the string as a potential center of an odd-length palindrome or a split point between two characters for an even-length palindrome. It then expands outwards from these centers to find the longest palindromic substring, updating the maximum length and start indices accordingly.

Example use cases:

```python
print(longest_palindromic_substring("babad"))  # Output: "bab"
print(longest_palindromic_substring("cbbd"))   # Output: "bb"
print(longest_palindromic_substring("a"))      # Output: "a"
print(longest_palindromic_substring(""))       # Output: ""
```
<end>Generate random password in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that generates a random password of a specified length:

```python
import string
import secrets

def generate_password(length: int) -> str:
    """
    Generates a random password of a specified length.

    Args:
        length (int): The desired length of the password.

    Returns:
        str: A random password of the specified length.
    """

    # Define the character set to use
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

    # Ensure the password is at least 8 characters long (a common requirement for secure passwords)
    if length < 8:
        length = 8

    # Generate a random password of the specified length
    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))

    return password
```

This function uses the `secrets` module, which is designed to generate cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets. The `string.ascii_letters` and `string.digits` constants are used to define the character set to use.

Example usage:

```python
print(generate_password(10))
# Output: A 10-character password (e.g., "F4r3dD5e6G")
```

Note that you should use this function responsibly, such as generating a random password for a user account, but not for storing sensitive data.
<end>Join list into string in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python function that performs the specified task:

```python
from typing import List

def join_list(items: List[str], delimiter: str = ' ') -> str:
    """
    Join list of strings into a single string.

    Args:
        items (List[str]): The list of strings to be joined.
        delimiter (str, optional): The delimiter to use between each item. Defaults to a space (' ') character.

    Returns:
        str: A single string containing all the elements from the input list.
    """
    return delimiter.join(items)
```

This function uses Python's built-in `join()` method of strings, which concatenates all the items in the list into a single string with the specified delimiter between each item. The optional `delimiter` parameter allows you to specify a custom separator if needed.

Example use cases:

```python
# Join a list of names with commas as separators
names = ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob']
print(join_list(names, ', '))  # Output: "John, Alice, Bob"

# Join a list of numbers without any delimiter
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(join_list(numbers))  # Output: "123"

# Use a custom delimiter (in this case, an asterisk)
fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
print(join_list(fruits, '*'))  # Output: "Apple*Banana*Cherry"
```
<end>Convert binary to decimal in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that converts binary to decimal:

```python
def binary_to_decimal(binary: str) -> int:

    Returns:
        int: The decimal equivalent of the input binary string.
    """
    return int(binary, 2)
```

Example use case:

```python
print(binary_to_decimal('1010'))  # Output: 10
print(binary_to_decimal('1101'))  # Output: 13
```

This function uses Python's built-in `int()` function to convert the binary string to decimal. The second argument `2` is used as the base of the number in the input string, which indicates that it's a binary number.
<end>Find strongly connected components in graph in Python.<start>Here is a Python implementation of a function that finds strongly connected components in a graph using the Kosaraju's algorithm:

```python

}

scc = strongly_connected_components(graph)
print(scc)  # Output should be [[0], [1, 2], [3], [5], [6, 7], [4]]
```

The above code defines a function `strongly_connected_components` that takes a graph represented as an adjacency list and returns the strongly connected components in the graph. The graph is first transformed into an object using the class `Graph`. Then, two depth-first searches (DFS) are performed to fill the SCC stack and get the SCCs.
<end>Calculate compound interest in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that calculates compound interest:

```python

    Returns:
        float: The total amount after 'time' years, including compound interest.
    """
    return principal * (1 + rate / n) ** (n * time)
```

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

*   `principal`: This is the initial amount of money being invested.
*   `rate`: This is the annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal. For example, 4% would be represented as 0.04.
*   `time`: This is the number of years that the investment will be held for.
*   `n`: This is the frequency at which interest is compounded per year. For example, if interest is compounded monthly, `n` would be 12.

The formula used in this function to calculate compound interest is:

`A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)`

Where:
*   A: The total amount after 'time' years.
*   P: The principal amount (initial investment).
*   r: The annual interest rate (in decimal).
*   n: The number of times that interest is compounded per year.
*   t: The time in years.

The function takes these values as arguments and returns the total amount after 'time' years, including compound interest.

Note that the `solve_sudoku_helper` function uses a recursive approach to fill in the grid. If it's possible to place a number at an empty cell and recursively solve the rest of the grid, it will return `True`. Otherwise, if no valid numbers can be placed or if all cells are filled but the puzzle is still unsolvable, it will backtrack and reset the cell to zero.
<end>Calculate age from birthdate in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that uses the `datetime` module to calculate an individual's age based on their birthdate:

```python
from datetime import date

def calculate_age(birthdate: date) -> int:
    """
    Calculate age from birthdate.

    Args:
        birthdate (date): The individual's birthdate.

    Returns:
        int: The individual's age in years.
    """
    today = date.today()
    age = today.year - birthdate.year

    if (today.month, today.day) < (birthdate.month, birthdate.day):
        age -= 1

    return age
```

Here's an example usage of this function:

```python
from datetime import date

# Define the individual's birthdate
birth_date = date(1990, 10, 5)

# Calculate and print their age
age = calculate_age(birth_date)
print("The individual is", age, "years old.")
```

In this code, we first get today's date using `date.today()`. We then subtract the birth year from today's year to get the age. However, since years are not always perfectly divided into days (due to leap years), if the birth month and day fall after today's date, we subtract one more year from the age.

Note that this function assumes the input is a `date` object representing the individual's birthdate in the format "year-month-day". If your dates have different formats or are represented as strings, you'll need to convert them to `date` objects before passing them to the `calculate_age()` function.
<end>Calculate sum of digits in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that calculates the sum of digits of a given integer:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n: int) -> int:

    Returns:
        int: The sum of digits of the input integer.
    """
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))
```

This function works by first converting the absolute value of the input integer to a string, then iterating over each character (i.e., each digit) in the string. It converts each character back to an integer using `int()`, and sums them up with `sum()`.

The use of `abs(n)` ensures that the function works correctly even for negative input integers.

Here's how you might test this function:

<end>Check if string contains substring in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that checks if a string `s` contains a substring:

```python
def contains_substring(s: str, substring: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a string contains a specified substring.

    Args:
        s (str): The original string.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string contains the substring, False otherwise.
    """
    return substring in s
```

This function uses Python's built-in string method `in` which checks for membership in a sequence. If the substring is found within the original string, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Example use cases:

```python
print(contains_substring("Hello World", "World"))  # Output: True
print(contains_substring("Hello World", "Universe"))  # Output: False
```

This function is concise and readable, following standard Python guidelines. It takes two string parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the substring exists within the original string.
<end>Find longest common subsequence in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that uses dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence between two strings:

```python

    """
    Find the longest common subsequence between two strings.

    Args:

        str: The longest common subsequence between s1 and s2.
    """

    # Initialize a 2D array to store the lengths of common subsequences
    dp = [[0] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]

    # Fill up the first row and column with zeros, since an empty string has no common subsequence
    for i in range(len(s1) + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
    for j in range(len(s2) + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 0

    # Fill up the rest of the table using dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Trace back the longest common subsequence from the table
    lcs = []
    i, j = len(s1), len(s2)
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
            lcs.append(s1[i - 1])

            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1

    # Return the longest common subsequence in reverse order, and then reverse it again
    return "".join(reversed(lcs))
```

Example usage:

```python
print(longest_common_subsequence("AGGTAB", "GXTXAYB"))  # Output: GTAB
print(longest_common_subsequence("", "hello"))  # Output: ""
print(longest_common_subsequence("hello", ""))  # Output: ""
print(longest_common_subsequence("abcde", "ace"))  # Output: ace
```
<end>Implement regex matching in Python.<start>Here is a Python implementation of the `regex_match` function using the built-in `re` module:

```python
import re

def regex_match(text: str, pattern: str) -> bool:
    """
    Perform regex matching on the given text and pattern.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to match.
        pattern (str): The regular expression pattern to match against.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the text matches the pattern, False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        # Attempt to compile the pattern
        regex = re.compile(pattern)
        
        # Check if the text matches the compiled pattern
        return bool(regex.match(text))
    
    except re.error as e:
        # If there's a syntax error in the pattern, raise an exception
        print(f"Invalid regular expression: {e}")
        return False
```

Here's an explanation of how this function works:

1. We import the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions.
2. The function takes two arguments: `text` and `pattern`.
3. We attempt to compile the `pattern` using `re.compile()`. This returns a regex object that we can use to match the text.
4. If the compilation succeeds, we check if the `text` matches the compiled pattern by calling its `match()` method. The result is then converted to a boolean value (True or False) and returned.
5. If there's a syntax error in the `pattern`, an exception is raised, and we print an error message before returning False.

You can use this function like this:
```python
print(regex_match("hello", "h.llo"))  # Output: True
print(regex_match("hello", "greetings"))  # Output: False
print(regex_match("1234", "\\d{4}"))  # Output: True
```
Note that the regular expression language used by Python is similar to Perl's regex syntax. You can consult the [Python `re` module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) for more information on how to write regex patterns.
<end>Find shortest supersequence in Python.<start>Here is a Python solution using dynamic programming. This problem can be solved by constructing a 2D table where each cell represents whether it's possible to construct the substring ending at that position from the substrings of `s1` and `s2`.

```python
def shortest_supersequence(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:
    """
    This function calculates the shortest supersequence of two strings.
    
    A supersequence is a string that contains all characters of another string as a subsequence. 
    The order in which they appear may be different.

    Args:
        s1 (str): First input string
        s2 (str): Second input string

    Returns:
        str: Shortest supersequence of s1 and s2
    """

    # Initialize the table with zeros
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Fill the table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # Build the supersequence by tracing back from the end of the table
    i, j = m, n
    result = []
    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
            result.append(s1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
            result.append(s1[i - 1])
            i -= 1
        else:
            result.append(s2[j - 1])
            j -= 1

    # Reverse the supersequence since we were appending to it in reverse order
    return ''.join(reversed(result))
```

This function returns a string that is the shortest possible supersequence of `s1` and `s2`. The time complexity is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively.
<end>Solve minimum spanning tree (Kruskal's algorithm) in Python.<start>Here is the Python implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree:

        self.parent = {}
    
    def add(self, node: Any):
        if node not in self.parent:
            self.parent[node] = node

    """
    
    # Initialize the Union-Find data structure

    # Sort the edges by weight in non-decreasing order
    sorted_edges = []
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            if u < v:  # Avoid duplicate edges
                sorted_edges.append((u, v, graph[u][v]))
    
    sorted_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

    return mst


# Example usage:

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 2, 'C': 3},
    'B': {'A': 2, 'D': 1},
    'C': {'A': 3, 'D': 4},
    'D': {'B': 1, 'C': 4}
}

mst = kruskal_mst(graph)
print("Minimum Spanning Tree Edges:")
for edge in mst:
    print(f"{edge[0]} -- {edge[1]} (weight: {edge[2]})")
```

This code implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph represented as an adjacency matrix. It first initializes a Union-Find data structure, adds all nodes in the graph to it, and sorts the edges by weight in non-decreasing order. Then, it iterates over the sorted edges and selects those that do not form a cycle. The selected edges are added to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), which is finally returned.

The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a sample graph represented as an adjacency matrix. It prints out the edges of the MST, along with their weights.
<end>Find all permutations of a string in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that uses recursion to generate all permutations of a given string:

```python
from typing import List

def string_permutations(s: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Find all permutations of a string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of all permutations of the input string.
    """

    # Base case: if the string is empty or has only one character, return it as is
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return [s]

    permutations = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Choose each character from the string and recursively generate all permutations of the remaining characters
        char = s[i]
        remaining_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
        sub_permutations = string_permutations(remaining_string)

        # Add the chosen character to the front of each permutation of the remaining string
        for p in sub_permutations:
            permutations.append(char + p)

    return permutations

# Example usage:
print(string_permutations("abc"))
```

In this function, we start by choosing an arbitrary position `i` within the input string `s`. We then choose the character at that position and recursively generate all permutations of the remaining characters (i.e., `s[:i] + s[i+1:]`). Finally, we add each chosen character to the front of each permutation of the remaining string.

This approach works because it exhaustively generates every possible combination of characters by iterating over all positions in the input string and combining the results using recursion.
<end>Linear search in list in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that performs a linear search on a given list of items:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def linear_search(items: List[Any], target: Any) -> int:
    """
    This function performs a linear search on a given list of items.
    
    Args:
        items (List[Any]): The list of items to be searched.
        target (Any): The item we are looking for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target item if found, -1 otherwise.
    """
    
    # Iterate over each item in the list
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        
        # Check if the current item is equal to the target
        if item == target:
            
            # If it is, return its index
            return i
    
    # If we've iterated through the entire list and haven't found the target,
    # then it's not in the list. Return -1.
    return -1

# Example usage:
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 12, 3]
index = linear_search(numbers, 8)
if index != -1:
    print(f"Found {8} at index {index}")
else:
    print("Not found")
```

This function iterates over the list and checks each item for equality with the target. If a match is found, its index is returned. If no match is found after iterating through the entire list, -1 is returned to indicate that the target was not in the list.

The example usage demonstrates how to call this function with a sample list and target value. The output will depend on whether the target is actually present in the list.
<end>Reverse a list in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that reverses a list:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def reverse_list(items: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Reverses a given list.

    Args:
        items (List[Any]): The list to be reversed.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: The reversed list.
    """
    return items[::-1]
```

In this function, `items[::-1]` uses Python's slice notation to create a new list that is the reverse of `items`. This works because the syntax `[start:stop:step]` means:

*   `start`: The starting index (inclusive). If omitted, it defaults to 0.
*   `stop`: The ending index (exclusive). If omitted, it defaults to the end of the list.
*   `step`: The step between indices. If omitted, it defaults to 1.

By using `-1` for the `step`, we are essentially stepping backwards through the list, effectively reversing it.

Note that this function assumes that you have Python 3.9 or later installed, where the built-in support for type hints allows for more accurate documentation and static analysis of your code.
<end>Implement Rabin-Karp algorithm in Python.<start>Here's a Python implementation of the Rabin-Karp algorithm:

                   If the pattern is not found, an empty list is returned.
    """

    # Base case: If the text or the pattern is empty, return an empty list
    if not text or not pattern:
        return []

    # Calculate the hash value of the pattern
    p = [ord(c) for c in pattern]
    h_p = sum(p)
    
    # Calculate the hash value of the first window of the text
    n_text = len(text)
    m_pattern = len(pattern)
    t = [ord(c) for c in text[:m_pattern]]
    h_t = sum(t)

    # Initialize a list to store the indices where the pattern is found
    indices = []

    # Iterate over each window of the text
    for i in range(n_text - m_pattern + 1):
        if h_t == h_p and text[i:i+m_pattern] == pattern:
            # If the hash values match, it means we have a potential match
            # We then need to compare the strings character by character to confirm
            indices.append(i)

        # Calculate the new window's hash value (rolling hash)
        if i < n_text - m_pattern:
            h_t = h_t - ord(text[i]) + ord(text[i+m_pattern])
    
    return indices

# Example usage
text = "AAAAAAABBBBCCCC"
pattern = "AAA"
print(rabin_karp_search(text, pattern))  # Output: [0]
```

This implementation includes a docstring that describes what the function does and provides information on its input parameters and output values. It also includes comments to help explain how the algorithm works.

In this example, we're searching for the string "AAA" within a larger text string "AAAAAAABBBBCCCC". The Rabin-Karp algorithm correctly identifies the pattern at index 0 in the output list.

    """
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
```

This function uses the mathematical formula for the area of a circle, which is `πr²`, where `r` is the radius. It takes a single argument, `radius`, and returns its square multiplied by `π`. 

You can use this function like so:

```python
print(circle_area(5))  # prints: 78.53981633974483
```

Note that I used the `**` operator to square the radius, which is a more readable way of expressing exponentiation than using the `pow()` function or a literal exponent (e.g., `radius * radius`).

                if len(state.suffixes) > 0 and any(len(suffix) == i + 1 for suffix in state.suffixes):
                    indices.append(i)
                
                break
        
        return indices

# Example usage:
patterns = ["ab", "bc"]
text = "abcd"
ahocorasick = AhoCorasick(patterns)
print(ahocorasick.search(text))  # Output: [2]
```
This code implements the Aho-Corasick algorithm for searching a list of patterns in a given text. It first builds a trie for each pattern, and then computes the failure links between states in the trie. The `search` method iterates over the characters of the text, using the trie and failure links to efficiently find matches.

Note that this code assumes that the input text is a string, not a list or other type. If you need to search multiple texts simultaneously, you can modify the code to use a loop around the `search` calls.
<end>Sort a list in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that sorts a list based on your specification:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def sort_list(items: List[Any], reverse: bool = False) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Sorts a list of items.

    Args:
        items (List[Any]): The list to be sorted.
        reverse (bool): Whether to sort in descending order. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: The sorted list.
    """
    return sorted(items, reverse=reverse)
```

This function uses Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the list. If `reverse` is `True`, it will sort the list in descending order; otherwise, it will sort in ascending order.

You can use this function like so:

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
sorted_numbers = sort_list(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]

# Sorting in descending order
sorted_numbers_descending = sort_list(numbers, reverse=True)
print(sorted_numbers_descending)  # Output: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1]
```
<end>Convert decimal to binary in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that converts decimal to binary:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:
    """
    Convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.

    Args:
        n (int): The decimal number to be converted.

    Returns:
        str: The binary representation of the input decimal number.
    """

    # Use built-in bin() function in Python, which converts an integer number to a binary string
    return bin(n)[2:]
```

Example usage:

```python
print(decimal_to_binary(10))  # Output: "1010"
print(decimal_to_binary(255))  # Output: "11111111"
```

Note that the `[2:]` is used to remove the '0b' prefix that `bin()` adds to its output. This ensures that the function returns a string without any extra characters, making it easier to work with binary data in Python.
<end>Find minimum in a list in Python.<start>Here is a simple Python function that uses the built-in `min` function to find the minimum value in a list of integers:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Find minimum in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The smallest integer in the list.
    """
    return min(numbers)
```

However, if you want to implement this without using the built-in `min` function for learning purposes or because you're working with very large lists where performance matters, here's an alternative implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def find_min(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Find minimum in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The smallest integer in the list.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Cannot find min of empty list")
    
    min_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num < min_num:
            min_num = num
            
    return min_num
```

This second function works by initializing `min_num` to the first number in the list, and then iterating over the rest of the list. If it finds a smaller number than the current `min_num`, it updates `min_num`. The function raises an error if the input list is empty.
<end>Find common elements in two lists in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that finds common elements in two lists:
```python
from typing import List, Any

def find_common_elements(list1: List[Any], list2: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Find common elements in two lists.

    Args:
        list1 (List[Any]): The first list.
        list2 (List[Any]): The second list.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: A list of common elements between the two input lists.
    """
    return [element for element in list1 if element in list2]
```
Here's an explanation of how this function works:

* We use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.
* The condition `element in list2` checks whether each element from `list1` is also present in `list2`. If it is, then we include it in our output list.
* This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the longer input list. However, for small to moderate-sized lists, this should be efficient enough.

Example usage:
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]

common_elements = find_common_elements(list1, list2)
print(common_elements)  # Output: [2, 4]
```
Note that this function uses the `Any` type hint from the `typing` module to indicate that it can handle lists of arbitrary types. If you want to restrict the input lists to contain only specific types (e.g., integers), you can replace `Any` with those types.
<end>Implement A* search algorithm in Python.<start>Here is a Python implementation of the A\* search algorithm:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Callable

        unvisited.remove(current_node)

        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:

        # Remove the current node from the priority queue since it's been visited
        pq.remove((current_distance, current_node))

    return None
```

Example usage:

```python

start_node = 'A'
goal_node = 'F'

path = a_star_search(graph, start_node, goal_node, heuristic)

In this code:

1. We define a `Queue` class to implement the queue data structure for BFS.
2. The `ford_fulkerson` function takes in the flow network represented as a dictionary of dictionaries and the source and sink nodes. It uses BFS to find augmenting paths, which are used to incrementally update the maximum flow.
3. The `bfs` function performs the breadth-first search, starting from the source node, and returns True if an augmenting path is found; False otherwise.

You can test this code by providing a sample flow network graph as input and verifying the calculated maximum flow value against your expected result.
<end>Validate email address in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that validates an email address using a regular expression:
```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """

    pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    return bool(re.match(pattern, email))
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

* The regular expression `pattern` matches most common email address formats. It checks for:
	+ One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens before the `@` symbol.
	+ An `@` symbol followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens.
	+ A dot (`.`) followed by two or more alphabetic characters (the top-level domain).
* The `re.match()` function applies this pattern to the input email address. If a match is found, it returns a match object which is truthy; otherwise, it returns None which is falsy.
* We use the `bool()` function to convert the result of `re.match()` to a boolean value (True or False).

Example usage:
```python
print(is_valid_email("john.doe@example.com"))  # True
print(is_valid_email("invalid_email"))  # False
```
Note that this implementation does not validate email addresses according to any specific email address format standard, such as the one defined in RFC 5322. However, it should be sufficient for most practical purposes.

        swapped = False

        # Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they're in the wrong order

print("Original array:", arr)
sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)

<end>Convert seconds to HH:MM:SS in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that achieves the desired conversion:

```python
def seconds_to_hms(seconds: int) -> str:
    """

    seconds = seconds % 60

    return f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}"
```

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We first calculate the number of hours by doing integer division (`//`) of `seconds` by 3600 (which is the number of seconds in one hour).
2. Next, we calculate the number of minutes by doing integer division of the remaining seconds (`seconds % 3600`) by 60.
3. Finally, we calculate the remaining seconds by taking the remainder of the previous step modulo 60.
4. We use an f-string to format the output as a string in the format HH:MM:SS. The `:02d` part means that each value should be formatted as a two-digit decimal number, padding with zeros if necessary.

Example usage:
```python
print(seconds_to_hms(3661))  # Output: "01:01:01"
print(seconds_to_hms(12345))  # Output: "03:25:45"
```

Note that this function assumes the input is a non-negative integer. If you need to handle negative seconds or non-integer values, you may want to modify the function accordingly!

<end>Solve 0/1 Knapsack problem in Python.<start>Here is a Python solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming:

```python
from typing import List

def knapsack_01(values: List[int], weights: List[int], capacity: int) -> int:
    """
    Solve 0/1 Knapsack problem.

    Args:
        values (List[int]): A list of item values.
        weights (List[int]): A list of item weights.
        capacity (int): The maximum weight the knapsack can hold.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum value that can be put in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.
    """

    # Create a 2D table to store results of subproblems
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(len(values) + 1)]

    # Fill the table in bottom-up manner
    for i in range(1, len(values) + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            # If the current item's weight exceeds the knapsack's capacity,
            # skip it and take the previous maximum value
            if weights[i - 1] > w:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
            else:
                # Otherwise, choose the maximum value between taking the current item or skipping it
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]])

    return dp[-1][-1]
```

Here is an explanation of how this code works:

*   We create a 2D table `dp` where each cell at row `i` and column `j` represents the maximum value that can be achieved by considering the first `i` items with capacity up to `j`.
*   We iterate over all subproblems using two nested loops (`for i in range(1, len(values) + 1)` and `for w in range(1, capacity + 1)`). For each subproblem, we check whether including the current item's value exceeds the knapsack's capacity. If it does, we simply copy the maximum value from the previous row (`dp[i - 1][w]`) into our table.
*   Otherwise, we compute two possibilities:
    *   **Take the current item**: We add the current item's value to the maximum value that can be obtained by using only the first `i-1` items with capacity up to `w - weights[i - 1]`.
    *   **Skip the current item**: We simply copy the maximum value from the previous row (`dp[i - 1][w]`) into our table.
*   Finally, we return the last cell's value in the 2D table (`dp[-1][-1]`), which represents the maximum possible value that can be put in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

You can use this function by calling it with three parameters:

```python
values = [60, 100, 120]
weights = [10, 20, 30]
capacity = 50

max_value = knapsack_01(values, weights, capacity)
print(max_value)  # Output: 220
```

<end>Reverse a string in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality Python function that reverses a given string:

```python
def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Reverses a given string.

    Args:

    """

    # Use slicing to reverse the string. The syntax [-1:] means start from the last character and go backwards until you reach the beginning of the string.
    return s[::-1]
```

You can use this function as follows:

```python
# Test the function
print(reverse_string("Hello, World!"))  # Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"
```

This solution is concise and readable. The slicing syntax `s[::-1]` is a common Python idiom for reversing sequences (strings, lists, tuples, etc.).
<end>Find longest common prefix in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that finds the longest common prefix of a list of strings:

```python
from typing import List

def longest_common_prefix(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Find the longest common prefix from a list of strings.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings.

    Returns:
        str: The longest common prefix.
    """

    if not strings:
        return ""

    shortest_str = min(strings, key=len)

    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):
        for string in strings:
            if string[i] != char:
                return shortest_str[:i]

    return shortest_str
```

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. We first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty string because there's no prefix to find.

2. We then find the shortest string in the list using the built-in `min` function with a key argument set to `len`. This ensures that we're always comparing strings of equal or shorter length than any other string in the list. If all strings are equally short, this will be one of them.

3. Next, we iterate over each character in the shortest string using `enumerate`, which also gives us its index.

4. For each character position, we check if it's consistent across all strings in the list by comparing it with the corresponding character in each string. If a mismatch is found, we return the prefix up to that point.

5. If no mismatches are found (i.e., the loop completes without returning), then the entire shortest string must be a common prefix of all strings, and we return it.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the list and m is the length of the shortest string in the list. However, since m is always at most n, this simplifies to O(n^2). This isn't particularly efficient for long lists or strings, but it should be sufficient for short lists and/or small strings.
<end>Validate credit card number in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that validates a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm:

```python
def is_valid_credit_card(card_number: str) -> bool:

    Args:
        card_number (str): The credit card number to validate.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the credit card number is valid, False otherwise.
    """

    # Remove any non-digit characters from the card number
    card_number = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, card_number))

    # Check that the card number has a length of 13-16 digits (as per standard)
    if len(card_number) < 13 or len(card_number) > 16:
        return False

    # Convert the card number to a list of integers
    digits = [int(x) for x in card_number]

    # Apply the Luhn algorithm
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        digit = digits[i]
        if i % 2 == 1:  # odd-indexed digits are multiplied by 2 and subtracted from 9
            digit *= 2
            if digit > 9:
                digit -= 9
        digits[i] = digit

    # Check that the card number sums to a multiple of 10 (i.e., ends in zero)
    return sum(digits) % 10 == 0
```

Here's an example usage:

```python
print(is_valid_credit_card("4532015112830366"))  # True
print(is_valid_credit_card("6011514433546201"))  # True
print(is_valid_credit_card("677154475890254"))   # False (not a valid credit card number)
```

This function uses the Luhn algorithm, which is widely used for validating credit card numbers. The algorithm works by doubling every second digit of the card number and subtracting 9 if the doubled value exceeds 9. It then checks that the resulting sum is divisible by 10 (i.e., ends in zero). If it does, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs(i)

    return bridge_edges

```

The function `find_bridges` performs a depth-first search on an input graph and returns all edges that are bridges. The algorithm uses two lists, `disc_time` and `low_time`, to keep track of the discovery time and low time for each node, respectively.

This approach ensures that the function runs in O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (or nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.

                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

Here's an example usage of this function:
```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],

}

start_node = 'A'
result = bfs(graph, start_node)
print(result)  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
```
This implementation uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to visit next. We iterate over the graph, marking each node as visited and adding its unvisited neighbors to the queue. This process continues until all reachable nodes have been visited.

Note that this function assumes that the input graph is represented as an adjacency list (a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes). If your graph is represented in a different format, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.

# Example usage:
dimensions = [30, 35, 15, 5, 10]
result = matrix_chain_multiplication(dimensions)
print("Minimum number of scalar multiplications:", result)
```

In this solution, we use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. We build up a table `min_multiplications` where `min_multiplications[i][j]` represents the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply matrices from index `i` to `j`. The final answer is stored in `min_multiplications[0][-1]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), where n is the number of matrices. This is because we iterate over all possible chains and for each chain, we consider all possible ways to split it into two parts.

```python
print(binary_exponentiation(2, 5))  # Output: 32 (2^5)
print(binary_exponentiation(3, 4))  # Output: 81 (3^4)
```

This function works by converting the exponent to binary and iterating over each bit. If a bit is 1, it multiplies the result by the base. It then squares the base for the next iteration, effectively "carrying" the value of the previous iterations.

Note that this function assumes that the input values are integers and will raise an error if they are not.

# Example usage
weight = 70.5  # in kg
height = 1.75  # in meters

bmi_value = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
print("BMI:", round(bmi_value, 2))
```

This function first checks for valid inputs by ensuring that weight and height are greater than zero. It then calculates the BMI using the formula: `BMI = weight / (height^2)`. The calculated BMI value is then returned.

The example usage shows how to use this function with sample values of weight (70.5 kg) and height (1.75 m). The calculated BMI value is printed out, rounded to two decimal places for readability.

        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.
    """

    # Remove any leading/trailing whitespace and convert to lowercase
    s1 = s1.strip().lower()
    s2 = s2.strip().lower()

    # If the lengths of the strings are different, they cannot be anagrams
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return False

    # Sort both strings alphabetically and compare
    return sorted(s1) == sorted(s2)
```

This function first removes any leading/trailing whitespace from the input strings and converts them to lowercase. It then checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`, as anagrams must have the same length.

Finally, it sorts both strings alphabetically using the built-in `sorted()` function and compares the results. If the sorted strings are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of this function:

```python
print(are_anagrams("listen", "silent"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("hello", "world"))    # Output: False
```

Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare the resulting dictionaries:

```python
from collections import Counter

def are_anagrams(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    return Counter(s1.strip().lower()) == Counter(s2.strip().lower())
```

This approach is more efficient than sorting the strings, especially for longer input strings.
<end>Convert celsius to fahrenheit in Python.<start>Here is a simple Python function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius: float) -> float:
    """
    Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

    Args:
        celsius (float): Temperature in degrees Celsius.

    Returns:
        float: Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
    """
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return round(fahrenheit, 2)
```

This function uses the formula `F = C × 9/5 + 32` to convert temperature from Celsius (`C`) to Fahrenheit (`F`). The result is rounded to two decimal places.

You can use this function like so:

```python
print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(0))  # Output: 32.00
print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(37))  # Output: 98.60
```

Note that the `round` function is used to round the result to two decimal places, as Fahrenheit temperatures are typically reported with this level of precision.
<end>Binary search in sorted list in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python function for binary search:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def binary_search(items: List[Any], target: Any) -> int:
    """

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target item if found, -1 otherwise.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is not sorted.
    """

    # Check if the input list is sorted
    if items != sorted(items):
        raise ValueError("The input list must be sorted.")

    low = 0  # Initialize the lower bound of the search space
    high = len(items) - 1  # Initialize the upper bound of the search space

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2  # Calculate the middle index of the current search space

        # Compare the target item with the middle element of the current search space
        if items[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Return the index of the target item if found
        elif items[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1  # Update the lower bound to search in the right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1  # Update the upper bound to search in the left half

    return -1  # Return -1 if the target item is not found
```

Example usage:

```python
items = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(binary_search(items, 6))  # Output: 2

items = [5, 9, 12, 15, 18]
print(binary_search(items, 10))  # Output: -1

<end>Calculate perimeter of rectangle in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle:

```python
def rectangle_perimeter(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        float: The perimeter of the rectangle.
    """
    return 2 * (length + width)
```

This function takes in two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are both floats. It returns the calculated perimeter as a float. The formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle is `2 * (length + width)`, which is implemented directly in the function.
<end>Check if string is valid parentheses in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that checks if a given string of characters is a valid set of parentheses:

```python
def is_valid_parentheses(s: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if the input string is a valid set of parentheses.

    A valid set of parentheses is defined as one that follows the following rules:
        - Every open parenthesis must be closed.
        - All close parentheses must be matched with an open parenthesis.
        - No extra opening or closing brackets are allowed.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the input string is a valid set of parentheses, False otherwise.
    """
    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack

    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            # Push opening parenthesis onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            # If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an open parenthesis,
            # then we have a mismatched close parenthesis, so return False
            if not stack or stack.pop() != '(':
                return False

    # After iterating through all characters in the string, 
    # if there are any remaining open parentheses on the stack,
    # that means they were never closed, so return False
    return not stack
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
print(is_valid_parentheses("()"))  # Output: True
print(is_valid_parentheses("()()"))  # Output: True
print(is_valid_parentheses("(())"))  # Output: True

print(is_valid_parentheses(")("))  # Output: False
print(is_valid_parentheses("("))  # Output: False
print(is_valid_parentheses(")))")  # Output: False
```
<end>Implement insertion sort in Python.<start>Here is a Python implementation of the insertion sort algorithm:
```python
from typing import List

def insertion_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): The input array to be sorted.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The sorted array.
    """

    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]  # Store the current element as the "key"
        
        j = i - 1  # Initialize a variable to keep track of the previous element
        
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            # If the previous element is greater than the key, shift it to the right
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        
        arr[j + 1] = key  # Insert the key at its correct position
    
    return arr
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We start from the second element (index `1`) and iterate over the array.
2. For each element, we store it as the "key" (`arr[i]`).
3. We then compare the key with its previous elements (starting from `i-1`). If a previous element is greater than the key, we shift that element to the right.
4. Once we find the correct position for the key, we insert it at that spot.

Example usage:
```python
arr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1]
sorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient for large datasets. However, it's still useful for small arrays or educational purposes!
<end>Find second largest in list in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
from typing import List

def find_second_largest(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Find the second largest number in a list.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The second largest number. If there is no second largest, returns None.
    """

    # Remove duplicates and sort the list in descending order
    unique_numbers = sorted(set(numbers), reverse=True)

    # If the list has less than 2 elements, return None (no second largest)
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        return None

    # The second largest number is the second element in the sorted list
    return unique_numbers[1]
```

Here's an example usage of this function:

```python
numbers = [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1]
print(find_second_largest(numbers))  # Output: 6

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(find_second_largest(numbers))  # Output: None

numbers = [10, 20, 30]
print(find_second_largest(numbers))  # Output: 20
```

Note that this function returns `None` if there is no second largest number in the list. If you'd like it to return a different value or raise an exception instead, just let me know!
<end>Check if matrix is symmetric in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that checks if a given matrix is symmetric:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def is_symmetric_matrix(matrix: List[List[Any]]) -> bool:
    """

    Args:
        matrix (List[List[Any]]): A 2D list representing the matrix.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the matrix is symmetric, False otherwise.
    """

    # Check if input is a list of lists
    if not isinstance(matrix, list) or not all(isinstance(row, list) for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a 2D list")

    # Get the size of the matrix
    num_rows = len(matrix)
    
    # If the matrix has no rows (i.e., it's empty), return True because an empty matrix is symmetric.
    if num_rows == 0:
        return True

    num_cols = len(matrix[0])
    
    # Check if all rows have the same number of columns
    if any(len(row) != num_cols for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("All rows must have the same number of columns")

    # Compare each element with its corresponding mirrored one
    for i in range(num_rows):
        for j in range(i+1, num_cols):
            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[j][i]:
                return False
    
    # If no mismatches were found, the matrix is symmetric
    return True

# Example usage:
matrix = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]
print(is_symmetric_matrix(matrix))  # Output: False

symmetric_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6]]
print(is_symmetric_matrix(symmetric_matrix))  # Output: True
```

This function first checks if the input is a list of lists and if all rows have the same number of columns. It then compares each element with its corresponding mirrored one. If any mismatches are found, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the matrix is symmetric.

Note: The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix, which might not be efficient for large matrices. However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the size of the matrix, we can use this approach. If you need to handle very large matrices, consider using a more efficient algorithm.
<end>Implement Huffman coding in Python.<start>Here is a Python implementation of Huffman coding:

```python
import heapq
from typing import Dict, Tuple

class Node:
    def __init__(self, char, freq):
        self.char = char
        self.freq = freq
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def calculate_frequency(text: str) -> Dict[str, int]:
    frequency = {}
    for char in text:
        if char not in frequency:
            frequency[char] = 0
        frequency[char] += 1
    return frequency

def build_huffman_tree(frequency: Dict[str, int]) -> Node:
    heap = [[weight, [char, ""]] for char, weight in frequency.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    while len(heap) > 1:
        lo = heapq.heappop(heap)
        hi = heapq.heappop(heap)
        for pair in lo[1:]:
            pair[1] = '0' + pair[1]
        for pair in hi[1:]:
            pair[1] = '1' + pair[1]
        heapq.heappush(heap, [lo[0] + hi[0]] + lo[1:] + hi[1:])

    return heap[0][1:]

def huffman_encoding(text: str) -> Tuple[Dict[str, str], str]:
    frequency = calculate_frequency(text)
    encoded = build_huffman_tree(frequency)
    
    # Generate the Huffman code table
    huffman_code_table = {}
    def generate_codes(node, code):
        if node.char is not None:
            huffman_code_table[node.char] = code
        if node.left is not None:
            generate_codes(node.left, code + '0')
        if node.right is not None:
            generate_codes(node.right, code + '1')

    generate_codes(encoded[0], '')
    
    # Perform Huffman encoding on the text
    encoded_text = ''
    for char in text:
        encoded_text += huffman_code_table[char]

    return huffman_code_table, encoded_text

# Example usage:
text = "this is an example"
huffman_code, encoded_text = huffman_encoding(text)
print("Huffman code table:", huffman_code)
print("Encoded text:", encoded_text)
```

This code defines a Huffman coding function `huffman_encoding` that takes in a string `text` and returns two values: the Huffman code table as a dictionary and the encoded text. The function works by first calculating the frequency of each character, then building a Huffman tree based on these frequencies, generating the Huffman code table, and finally performing Huffman encoding on the input text.

The `Node` class is used to represent nodes in the Huffman tree, which has attributes for the character, frequency, left child, and right child. The `calculate_frequency` function calculates the frequency of each character in the input string, and the `build_huffman_tree` function builds a Huffman tree based on these frequencies.

The `huffman_encoding` function first builds a Huffman tree using the `build_huffman_tree` function, then generates the Huffman code table by traversing this tree. Finally, it performs Huffman encoding on the input text by replacing each character with its corresponding Huffman code from the generated table.

        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:
            merged.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1

    # If there are remaining elements in the left or right list, append them to the merged result
    merged.extend(left[left_index:])
    merged.extend(right[right_index:])

    return merged


# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

This implementation uses a recursive approach to divide the array into smaller chunks until each chunk is sorted, then merges the chunks back together in sorted order. The `merge` function is used to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
<end>Convert HEX to RGB color in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that achieves this:

    # Convert each hexadecimal digit to its integer value and return as RGB
    rgb = tuple(int(hex_color[i:i+2], 16) for i in (0, 2, 4))

    return rgb

print(hex_to_rgb('#FF0000'))  # Output: (255, 0, 0)
print(hex_to_rgb('#00FF00'))  # Output: (0, 255, 0)
```

This function takes a HEX color string as input, removes the '#' symbol if present, checks if it's a valid HEX color, and returns its RGB equivalent. The `Tuple[int, int, int]` return type is specified using Python's built-in `typing` module to indicate that this function returns a tuple of three integers representing the red, green and blue components of the color.
<end>Capitalize first letter of each word in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string:

```python
def capitalize_words(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Capitalize the first letter of each word.

    Args:

    Returns:
        str: The modified string with first letter of each word capitalized.
    """
    return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split())
```

Here's an explanation of how this function works:

1. `s.split()` splits the input string into a list of words, using spaces as delimiters.
2. A generator expression `word.capitalize() for word in ...` is used to capitalize each word.
   - The `capitalize()` method capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes all other letters lowercase.
3. `' '.join(...)` joins the capitalized words back together with a space between each word.

Example use case:

```python
print(capitalize_words("hello world"))  # Output: "Hello World"
```

This function assumes that input strings will contain only spaces as word separators and does not handle punctuation attached to words. If you need more sophisticated text processing, consider using a library like `wordninja` or `spacy`.

shortest_path = dijkstra(graph, start_node, end_node)

In this version, we use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to compute the Catalan numbers. We start with the base case `C(0) = 1` and then iteratively calculate each subsequent Catalan number based on the previous ones.

This function will run in O(n^2) time complexity, which is much more efficient than using factorials for large values of `n`.
<end>Generate pascal's triangle in Python.<start>Here is a Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle:

```python
from typing import List

def pascal_triangle(n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Generates Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of rows in the triangle.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store the triangle
    triangle = []

    # Loop through each row up to the nth row
    for i in range(n):
        # Create a new list to represent the current row
        row = [1]

        # If it's not the first row, calculate the values for this row based on the previous row
        if i > 0:
            prev_row = triangle[i-1]
            # Calculate each value in the row as the sum of the two values directly above it
            row.extend([prev_row[j] + prev_row[j+1] for j in range(i-1)])

        # Add a final 1 to the end of the row (since every row ends with a 1)
        row.append(1)

        # Add the current row to the triangle
        triangle.append(row)

    return triangle

# Example usage:
print(pascal_triangle(5))
```

This function uses a simple iterative approach to generate each row in Pascal's Triangle. The first row is always `[1]`, and each subsequent row is calculated by adding pairs of adjacent values from the previous row, with a final 1 appended to the end.

When you call `pascal_triangle(5)`, it will output:

```
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
```
<end>Remove vowels from a string in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that performs the task:

```python
def remove_vowels(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes all vowels from a given string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        str: The input string with all vowels removed.
    """
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.lower() not in 'aeiou'])
```

This function uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string. It checks if the lowercase version of the character is not in the set of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If it's not a vowel, it includes the character in the new string; otherwise, it excludes it.

You can use this function like so:

```python
print(remove_vowels("Hello World"))  # Outputs: "Hll Wrld"
```

This will print the input string with all vowels removed.
<end>Find all prime factors of a number in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that uses a loop to divide the input number `n` by increasing integers until it finds one that divides evenly (i.e., a divisor), then continues dividing the result of this division process recursively, effectively finding all prime factors.

```python
from typing import List

def prime_factors(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Finds and returns a list of all prime factors of the input integer n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to find prime factors for.
        
    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of prime factors of n.
    """
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:  # Only go up to sqrt(n) because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked
        if n % i:
            # If n is not divisible by i, increment and check next integer
            i += 1
        else:
            # If n is divisible by i, divide it and add to factors list; repeat for this new divisor until no longer divisible (i.e., prime factor found)
            while n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n //= i  # Divide the number n by i
    if n > 1:  # If after all iterations, number is still greater than 1, it means the remaining number is a prime number itself
        factors.append(n)  # So add this prime number to our list of factors
    return factors

# Example usage:
print(prime_factors(315))  # Output: [3, 3, 5, 7]
```

Note that we start with `i = 2`, which is the smallest prime number. We then use a while loop to check divisibility by increasing integers up until the square root of `n`. If we find a divisor, we continue dividing the result until it's no longer divisible (indicating a prime factor), and repeat this process for each found prime factor.

Finally, we append any remaining number greater than 1 as an additional prime factor.
<end>Find maximum subarray sum in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that finds the maximum subarray sum:

```python
from typing import List

def max_subarray_sum(arr: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the maximum subarray sum.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum subarray sum.
    """

    # Check if the array is empty
    if not arr:
        return 0

    # Initialize max_so_far and max_ending_here to the first element of the array
    max_so_far = max_ending_here = arr[0]

    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Update max_ending_here by adding the current element
        max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])

        # Update max_so_far if max_ending_here is greater
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return max_so_far
```

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. It initializes two variables `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here` to the first element of the array.
2. Then it iterates over the rest of the array, updating `max_ending_here` by adding the current element. If the result is greater than the current `max_ending_here`, it updates `max_ending_here`. This effectively keeps track of the maximum sum of subarrays ending at each position in the array.
3. For each position in the array, it also checks if the new value of `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`. If so, it updates `max_so_far`.
4. At the end of the function, `max_so_far` will be the maximum subarray sum.

Example usage:

```python
arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
print(max_subarray_sum(arr))  # Output: 7
```

This example finds that the maximum subarray sum is `4 + (-1) + 1 + 5 = 9`, but I made a mistake in the comment.
<end>Encrypt text using Caesar cipher in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that implements the Caesar cipher encryption:

```python
def caesar_encrypt(text: str, shift: int) -> str:
    """
    Encrypts text using Caesar cipher with a given shift.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to be encrypted.
        shift (int): The number of positions to shift each letter.

    Returns:
        str: The encrypted text.
    """

    # Check if the input is valid
    if not isinstance(text, str) or not isinstance(shift, int):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input type. Text should be a string and shift should be an integer.")

    result = ""
    
    for char in text:
        # If the character is an alphabet letter
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97  # ASCII values for 'A' and 'a'
            new_char_value = (ord(char) - ascii_offset + shift) % 26 + ascii_offset
            
            # Convert the new character value back to a character
            result += chr(new_char_value)
        else:
            # If the character is not an alphabet letter, add it as is
            result += char
    
    return result

# Example usage:
encrypted_text = caesar_encrypt("Hello, World!", 3)
print(encrypted_text)  # Output: "Khoor, Zruog!"
```

This function takes a string `text` and an integer `shift` as input. It shifts each alphabet letter in the text by the given shift value using ASCII values to calculate the new character positions. Non-alphabet characters are left unchanged. The result is returned as the encrypted text.

The example usage shows how you can use this function to encrypt a string with a given shift, and print out the encrypted text.
<end>Generate Fibonacci sequence in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number:

```python
from typing import List

def fibonacci_sequence(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.

    Args:
        n (int): The length of the sequence to generate.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence.
    """

    # Initialize a list with the first two numbers in the sequence
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    # Generate the rest of the sequence up to the nth number
    for i in range(2, n):
        next_number = fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2]
        fib_sequence.append(next_number)

    return fib_sequence[:n]
```

Here's an example usage:

```python
print(fibonacci_sequence(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

This function uses a loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number. It starts with a list containing just the first two numbers in the sequence (0 and 1), then iteratively appends each subsequent number by summing the last two numbers in the list.

Note: The `[:n]` slice at the end is used to truncate the output list to the desired length (`n`).
<end>Calculate distance between points in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality Python function that meets your requirements:

```python
import math

def calculate_distance(x1: float, y1: float, x2: float, y2: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the distance between two points using the Euclidean distance formula.

    Args:
        x1 (float): The x-coordinate of the first point.
        y1 (float): The y-coordinate of the first point.
        x2 (float): The x-coordinate of the second point.
        y2 (float): The y-coordinate of the second point.

    Returns:
        float: The distance between the two points.
    """
    # Calculate the difference in x and y coordinates
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1

    # Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance
    distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)

    return distance
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
print(calculate_distance(1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0))  # Output: 5.0
```

This function uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. The distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in x and y coordinates.
<end>Check if string is palindrome in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if the input string is a palindrome.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """

    # Remove any non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to lowercase
    cleaned_s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum()).lower()

    # Compare the cleaned string with its reverse
    return cleaned_s == cleaned_s[::-1]
```

This function uses a few techniques to make it efficient:

* It removes any non-alphanumeric characters from the input string, which means it ignores spaces, punctuation, etc.
* It converts the string to lowercase, so that it can correctly identify palindromes with different cases (e.g., "Madam" and "madam").
* It uses slicing (`[::-1]`) to reverse the cleaned string, rather than using a loop or recursion.

You can test this function with example inputs like `is_palindrome("radar")` or `is_palindrome("hello")`.

linked_list.prepend(0)

print("Linked List:")
linked_list.print_list()

linked_list.delete(1)
print("\nAfter deleting 1:")
linked_list.print_list()

```

This implementation includes methods to append (add to the end), prepend (add to the beginning), and delete elements from the linked list, as well as a `print_list` method for printing the current state of the linked list. 

Please note that this code assumes you're familiar with basic object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
<end>Remove duplicates from a list in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that removes duplicates from a list:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def remove_duplicates(items: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Removes duplicates from a list.
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        List[Any]: A new list with duplicates removed.
    """
    return list(set(items))
```

This function works by converting the input list to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. It then converts this set back into a list.

However, note that this approach has some limitations:

- The order of elements is not preserved in the output list.
- This approach assumes that the elements in the list are hashable (i.e., can be added to and compared in a set), which includes types like `int`, `float`, `str`, etc., but excludes types like `list` or `dict`.

If you need to preserve order, you could use a different approach:

```python
def remove_duplicates_ordered(items: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Removes duplicates from a list while preserving the original order.
    
    Args:
        items (List[Any]): The input list to remove duplicates from.

            j = prefix[j - 1]
        if text[i] == pattern[j]:
            j += 1

        # If the entire pattern matches, add the match index to the list.
        if j == len(pattern):
            match_indices.append(i + 1 - len(pattern))  # Subtract length of pattern because Python uses 0-based indexing
            j = prefix[j - 1]  # Reset j to the value of the prefix function at the current position

    return match_indices


# Example usage:
text = "banana"
pattern = "ana"

matches = kmp_search(text, pattern)
print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' found at indices: {matches}")
```

This code defines two functions:

1. `compute_prefix_function(pattern)`: This function computes the prefix function for a given pattern string.

2. `kmp_search(text, pattern)`: This function uses the computed prefix function to perform the KMP search on the text and returns a list of indices where the pattern is found.

The example usage demonstrates how to use these functions to find matches for the pattern "ana" in the text "banana".
<end>Implement Fisher-Yates shuffle in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that implements the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm:

```python
import random

    """
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Iterate over the array from the last element to the first
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Generate a random index j such that 0 <= j <= i
        j = random.randint(0, i)
        
        # Swap arr[i] with arr[j]
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    
    return arr
```

This function works by iterating over the array from the last element to the first. For each pair of elements at indices `i` and `j`, it generates a random index `j` such that `0 <= j <= i`. It then swaps the elements at these two indices. This process continues until all pairs of adjacent elements have been swapped, resulting in an unbiased shuffle.

Example usage:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print("Original array:", arr)

# Shuffle the array using Fisher-Yates shuffle
shuffled_arr = fisher_yates_shuffle(arr[:])

print("Shuffled array:", shuffled_arr)
```

Note that `fisher_yates_shuffle` takes a copy of the input array to avoid modifying it in-place.
<end>Implement LRU cache in Python.<start>Here is the implementation of an LRU cache in Python:

            return value
        except KeyError:
            return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        """
        Add or update a value in the cache.

        """
        try:
            self.cache.pop(key)
        except KeyError:
            pass

        if len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)  # Remove the least recently used item

        self.cache[key] = value
```

Here's an example of how to use this LRU cache:

```python
cache = LRUCache(2)

cache.put(1, 1)
cache.put(2, 2)
print(cache.get(1))  # Output: 1
cache.put(3, 3)       # Key 2 is removed from the cache
print(cache.get(2))  # Output: -1 (since key 2 has been removed)
```

This implementation uses an `OrderedDict` to keep track of the keys and their associated values. When a value is retrieved using `get`, it moves that key to the end of the dictionary, which effectively marks it as recently used. If the cache exceeds its capacity and we try to add a new value with `put`, the least recently used item (i.e., the one at the front of the dictionary) is removed before adding the new item.

    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],

print(find_articulation_points(graph))  # Output: ['B']

In this example, node `B` is an articulation point because removing it would disconnect the graph.
<end>Compress string in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that uses Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to compress a given string:

    """
    
    # Check if input string is empty
    if not s:
        return s
    
    compressed = ""
    count = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        # If current character is same as previous one, increment count
        if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
            count += 1
        # If different, add the count and character to compressed string
        else:
            compressed += str(count) + s[i - 1]
            count = 1
    
    # Add the last character's count and itself to compressed string
    compressed += str(count) + s[-1]
    
    return compressed if len(compressed) < len(s) else s

# Example usage:
print(compress_string("AAAAABBBCCC"))  
print(compress_string("AAABBBCCC"))   
print(compress_string("ABC"))         
```
In the above code, we define a function called `compress_string` that takes an input string `s`. We initialize an empty string `compressed` to store the compressed output and a counter variable `count` initialized with 1.

We then iterate over each character in the input string. If the current character is the same as the previous one, we increment the count. If different, we add the count and the character itself to the compressed string and reset the count to 1. Finally, after iterating over all characters, we add the last character's count and itself to the compressed string.

After compression, if the length of the compressed string is less than or equal to the original input string, we return the compressed string; otherwise, we return the original input string for comparison purposes.
<end>Implement depth-first search in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality Python implementation of the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List

def dfs(graph: Dict[Any, List[Any]], start: Any) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Performs a depth-first search traversal on the given graph.

    Args:

    - start (Any): The node to start the traversal from.

    Returns:
    - List[Any]: A list of nodes visited in the order they were traversed.
    """
    # Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes
    visited = set()
    
    # Initialize a list to store the order of visited nodes
    traversal_order = []
    
    # Define a recursive helper function to perform the DFS traversal
    def dfs_helper(node: Any) -> None:
        # Mark the current node as visited
        visited.add(node)
        
        # Add the current node to the traversal order
        traversal_order.append(node)
        
        # Iterate over all neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            # If a neighbor has not been visited yet, recursively visit it
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs_helper(neighbor)
    
    # Check if the start node exists in the graph
    if start not in graph:
        raise ValueError(f"Start node '{start}' not found in graph")
    
    # Start the DFS traversal from the given start node
    dfs_helper(start)
    
    return traversal_order
```

This implementation uses a recursive helper function `dfs_helper` to perform the depth-first search traversal. The traversal order is stored in the `traversal_order` list, which is returned by the main `dfs` function.

Example usage:
```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

start_node = 'A'

traversal_order = dfs(graph, start_node)
print(traversal_order)  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'C']
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `dfs` function to perform a depth-first search traversal on a sample graph. The resulting traversal order is printed out.

        """
        root_x = self.find(x)
        root_y = self.find(y)

        if root_x != root_y:
            # Union by rank
            if self.rank[root_x] > self.rank[root_y]:
                self.parent[root_y] = root_x
            elif self.rank[root_x] < self.rank[root_y]:
                self.parent[root_x] = root_y
            else:
                self.parent[root_y] = root_x
                self.rank[root_x] += 1

# Example usage:
uf = UnionFind(10)
print(uf.find(0))    # Output: 0
print(uf.find(5))    # Output: 5
uf.union(0, 5)
print(uf.find(0))    # Output: 5
```

In this implementation:

*   `__init__` initializes the Union-Find data structure with a specified number of elements.
*   The `find` method returns the representative element for a given element using path compression and optimization.
*   The `union` method unites two sets containing the provided elements by rank, which is an efficient way to perform union operations.
<end>Calculate dot product of vectors in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that calculates the dot product of two vectors:

```python
from typing import List

def dot_product(v1: List[float], v2: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the dot product of two vectors.

    Args:
        v1 (List[float]): The first vector.

    Returns:
        float: The dot product of the two vectors.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the vectors have different lengths.
    """

    # Check if both vectors have the same length
    if len(v1) != len(v2):
        raise ValueError("Both vectors must have the same length")

    # Use a list comprehension to multiply corresponding elements and sum them up
    return sum(x * y for x, y in zip(v1, v2))
```

Here's an explanation of how this function works:

- It first checks if both input lists `v1` and `v2` have the same length. If they don't, it raises a `ValueError`.
- Then, using a list comprehension, it multiplies each corresponding element from `v1` and `v2`, effectively creating a sequence of products.
- Finally, it sums up this sequence of products to calculate the dot product.

Example usage:

```python
v1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
v2 = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]

print(dot_product(v1, v2))  # Output: 32.0
```
<end>Check if number is Armstrong number in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that checks if a given integer is an Armstrong number:

```python
def is_armstrong_number(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is an Armstrong number, False otherwise.
    """

    # Convert the number to string to calculate its digits
    num_str = str(n)

    # Calculate the number of digits in the number
    num_digits = len(num_str)

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the number's digits raised to the power of the number of digits
    armstrong_sum = 0

    # Iterate over each digit in the number and add it to the sum raised to the power of the number of digits
    for digit in num_str:
        armstrong_sum += int(digit) ** num_digits

    # Return True if the calculated sum is equal to the original number, False otherwise
    return n == armstrong_sum
```

Example use cases:

```python
print(is_armstrong_number(153))  # Returns: True (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153)
print(is_armstrong_number(370))  # Returns: True (3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370)
print(is_armstrong_number(1234))  # Returns: False
```

This function works by calculating the sum of each digit in the number raised to the power of the total number of digits. If this sum is equal to the original number, then it's an Armstrong number and the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
<end>Implement Bellman-Ford algorithm in Python.<start>Here is a Python implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm:

        start (Any): The node from which we want to find shortest paths to all other nodes.

    Returns:
        Dict[Any, int]: A dictionary with the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes.
    """

    # Initialize distances for each node
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    # Relax edges repeatedly
    for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
        for node, neighbors in graph.items():
            for neighbor, weight in neighbors.items():
                if distances[node] != float('inf') and distances[node] + weight < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + weight

    # Check for negative-weight cycles
    for node, neighbors in graph.items():
        for neighbor, weight in neighbors.items():
            if distances[node] != float('inf') and distances[node] + weight < distances[neighbor]:
                raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")

    return distances
```

This function takes as input a weighted graph represented as an adjacency list (a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is another dictionary with neighboring nodes as keys and weights as values), and a start node. It returns a dictionary where the keys are all nodes in the graph, and the values are their respective shortest distances from the start node.

Note that this function assumes that all weights in the graph are integers (which they must be since we're using an integer type for them).

Also note that this implementation includes error checking to ensure that there are no negative-weight cycles in the graph. If a negative-weight cycle is detected, it raises a ValueError with a message indicating that fact.

Here's how you might use this function:

```python
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 4, 'C': 3},
    'B': {'D': 5},
    'C': {'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {}
}

print(bellman_ford(graph, 'A'))  # Output: {'A': 0, 'B': 6, 'C': 3, 'D': 4}
```
<end>Find GCD of two numbers in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm:

```python
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """

        b (int): The second number.

        int: The GCD of a and b.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)
```

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We start with two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. If `b` is zero, we simply return `a` as the GCD (since any number divided by 0 gives infinity, but in this case, it's not considered a valid remainder).
3. Otherwise, we update `a` to be the current value of `b`, and we calculate the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
4. We repeat steps 2-3 until `b` is zero.
5. At that point, `a` will be the GCD of the original two numbers.

Note: The `abs()` function is used to ensure the result is a positive integer (since negative integers are not considered valid remainders).
<end>Generate random number in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that generates a random number within a given range:

```python

def generate_random_number(min_value: int, max_value: int) -> int:
    """

    Args:
        min_value (int): The minimum value in the range.

    Returns:
        int: A random integer between min_value and max_value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If min_value is greater than max_value.
    """
    if min_value > max_value:
        raise ValueError("min_value cannot be greater than max_value")

    return random.randint(min_value, max_value)
```

Example use cases:

```python
print(generate_random_number(1, 10))  # Generates a random number between 1 and 10
print(generate_random_number(-5, 0))  # Generates a random number between -5 and 0

# Attempting to generate a random number with invalid range:
try:
    print(generate_random_number(10, 5))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: min_value cannot be greater than max_value
```

This function uses the `random.randint(a, b)` function from Python's built-in `random` module to generate a random integer within the specified range. It also includes input validation to ensure that `min_value` is not greater than `max_value`. If an attempt is made to generate a number outside this valid range, it raises a `ValueError`.

<end>Generate multiplication table in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that generates a multiplication table:

```python

In this function:

*   We first initialize an empty `n x n` table with zeros using list comprehension.
*   Then, we iterate over each element in the table (from row 1 to n and from column 1 to n) and calculate its product by multiplying the current row number (`i`) and column number (`j`). The result is stored at position `(i - 1, j - 1)` in the table because list indices are zero-based.
*   Finally, we return the completed multiplication table.

The example usage shows how to call this function with `n = 5` and print out the resulting table.

This code defines a `BinarySearchTree` class with the following methods:

*   `__init__`: Initializes an empty binary search tree.
*   `insert(data)`: Inserts a new node into the binary search tree.
*   `search(data)`: Searches for a specific value in the binary search tree and returns True if found, False otherwise.
*   `delete(data)`: Deletes a specific value from the binary search tree.

Additionally, it includes helper methods:

*   `_insert(node, data)`: Recursively inserts a new node into the binary search tree.
*   `_search(node, data)`: Recursively searches for a specific value in the binary search tree.
*   `_delete(node, data)`: Recursively deletes a specific value from the binary search tree.
*   `_find_min(node)`: Recursively finds the minimum value in a subtree.
*   `inorder(node=None)`: Prints or returns the values of all nodes in the binary search tree, in ascending order using inorder traversal.
<end>Calculate factorial using recursion in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number `n` using recursion:

```python
def factorial_recursive(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number n.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number for which to calculate the factorial.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the input number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input number is negative.
    """

    # Check if input number is negative
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")

    # Base case: Factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
```

Here's an example usage:

```python
print(factorial_recursive(5))  # Output: 120
```

This function will recursively call itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches the base case (`n == 0 or n == 1`), at which point it starts returning the factorial value back up the recursive chain. The final result is returned as the output.

Note that this function raises a `ValueError` if the input number `n` is negative, since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers in mathematics.
<end>Implement stack data structure in Python.<start>Here's a Python implementation of the stack data structure as per your requirements:

```python
from typing import Any

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty list to serve as our stack.
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item: Any) -> None:
        # Add an element to the top of the stack (append to the end of our list).
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """
        Remove and return the topmost element from the stack.
        
        Raises a IndexError if the stack is empty.
        """
        if not self.is_empty():
            # Return the last item in the list (top of the stack), then remove it.
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("Cannot pop from an empty stack")

    def peek(self) -> Any:
        """
        Look at but don't remove the topmost element from the stack.
        
        Raises a IndexError if the stack is empty.
        """
        if not self.is_empty():
            # Return the last item in the list (top of the stack), without removing it.
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Cannot peek at an empty stack")

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        # Check whether our list is currently empty.
        return len(self.items) == 0
```

Here's a brief explanation of how the above code works:

- `__init__`: Initializes the Stack with an empty list.

- `push(item)` adds an item to the top of the stack (end of the list).

- `pop()`: Removes and returns the topmost item. If the stack is empty, it raises an IndexError.

- `peek()` lets you look at the topmost item without removing it. Like pop(), if the stack is empty, it also raises an IndexError.

- `is_empty()`: Checks whether the stack currently has items in it.

You can use this Stack class as follows:

```python
s = Stack()
print(s.is_empty())  # Output: True

s.push(1)
s.push(2)

print(s.peek())  # Output: 2
print(s.pop())   # Output: 2
print(s.is_empty())  # Output: False
```

This example shows that the stack has been correctly implemented, with push adding items to the top of the stack and pop removing them. The peek method allows you to look at the topmost item without removing it. Finally, the is_empty method checks whether the stack contains any items.
<end>Extract domain from URL in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that extracts the domain from a given URL:

```python
import urllib.parse

def extract_domain(url: str) -> str:
    """
    Extracts the domain from a given URL.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL to extract the domain from.

    Returns:
        str: The extracted domain.
    """
    parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    return f"{parsed_url.hostname}"
```

This function uses the `urlparse` function from Python's standard library to parse the input URL into its components. It then extracts the hostname component, which contains the domain.

Here's an example usage of this function:

```python
print(extract_domain("http://example.com/path/to/page"))  # Output: "example.com"
```

Note that this function does not account for subdomains or other complexities that may be present in URLs. If you need to handle those cases, a more sophisticated approach would be required.

For example, if the input URL is `"http://subdomain.example.com/path/to/page"`, this function will still return `"example.com"` as the domain, but it might be desirable to return the full subdomain (`"subdomain.example.com"`). If that's the case, you could modify the function like so:

```python
def extract_domain(url: str) -> str:
    parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    return f"{parsed_url.hostname}"
```

However, if you need to account for all possible complexities in URLs (e.g., URL fragments, query strings), a more advanced approach might be necessary.
<end>Calculate factorial in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given integer `n`:

```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given integer.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number for which to calculate the factorial.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the input number.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input number is negative, since factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial. It first checks if the input is negative, in which case it raises a ValueError since factorial is not defined for negative numbers. If the input is non-negative, it uses a loop to calculate the factorial.

You can use this function like this:

```python
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

Note that the time complexity of this function is O(n), which means it becomes slower as the input number increases. If you need to compute large factorials, you may want to consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.

Alternatively, you can also use a recursive approach:

```python
def factorial_recursive(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given integer recursively.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The input number for which to calculate the factorial.
    
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the input number.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input number is negative, since factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
```

This recursive function works the same way as the iterative one, but uses recursion instead of loops. However, be aware that recursive functions can cause stack overflows if they are too deep, which may not be an issue for small input numbers but could become a problem for larger ones.
<end>Count word frequency in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that counts word frequency using the `collections` module:

```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def count_word_frequency(text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Counts the frequency of each word in the given text.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are words and values are their frequencies.
    """
    # Convert to lowercase, remove punctuation, and split into words
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text.lower())
    
    # Count word frequency
    frequency = Counter(words)
    
    return dict(frequency)
```

Example use case:

```python
text = "This is a sample text. The text contains multiple words."
frequency = count_word_frequency(text)
print(frequency)
```

Output:
```python
{'this': 1, 'is': 2, 'a': 1, 'sample': 1, 'text': 3, 'contains': 1, 'multiple': 1, 'words': 1}
```

This function uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each word in the input text. It first converts the text to lowercase and removes punctuation using a regular expression. The words are then split out and passed to the `Counter` class to get their frequencies. Finally, it returns a dictionary where keys are the unique words and values are their corresponding frequencies.
<end>Encode string to ROT13 in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that performs the ROT13 encoding on a given string:

```python
def rot13_encode(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Encodes a string using ROT13.

    The ROT13 (Rotating 13 places) algorithm replaces each letter in the input string with a different letter.
    It works by shifting letters 13 positions down the alphabet. A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to encode.

    Returns:
        str: The encoded string using ROT13.
    """
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            # Find the ASCII offset of 'A' or 'a'
            ascii_offset = ord('A') if char.isupper() else ord('a')
            # Calculate the new character by shifting 13 places
            encoded_char = chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + 13) % 26 + ascii_offset)
            result += encoded_char
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

This function iterates over each character in the input string. If it's a letter, it shifts the letter 13 positions down the alphabet and adds the resulting character to the output string. If it's not a letter (e.g., punctuation or whitespace), it simply copies it to the output string without modification.

Example usage:

```python
print(rot13_encode("Hello, World!"))  # Output: "Uryyb, Jbeyq!"
```
<end>Check if year is leap year in Python.<start>Here is the Python function:

```python
def is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a given year is a leap year.

    A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00).
    The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.
    
    Args:
        year (int): The year to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
    """
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
```

Example use cases:

```python
print(is_leap_year(2020))   # True
print(is_leap_year(1900))   # False
print(is_leap_year(2000))   # True
print(is_leap_year(2019))   # False

This implementation follows these rules:

*   A `remove` method to delete entries associated with a given key from the hash table.
*   An internal `_resize` method to double the size of the hash table when necessary.

                         Each configuration is represented as a list of strings, 
                         where 'Q' represents a queen and '.' represents an empty space.
    """
    def can_place(row: int) -> bool:
        """Checks if a queen can be placed at the current column."""
        for i in range(row):

                return False

                return False
        return True

        """Places the queens on the board."""
        result = []
        if row == n:
            result.append(['.' * n for _ in range(n)])
            return result
        
        for col in range(n):
            if can_place(row):
                board[row] = col
                result.extend(place_queens(n, row + 1))
        
        return result

    # Initialize the board and start placing queens
    board = [-1]*n
    result = place_queens(n)

    # Convert indices to actual board configurations
    final_result = []

    return final_result
```

Example usage:

```python
>>> print(solve_n_queens(4))
[['.Q..', ...], ['...Q', ...]]
```

This function uses a recursive approach to solve the N-Queens problem. It first defines two helper functions: `can_place(row)` checks if a queen can be placed at the current column, and `place_queens(n, row)` places the queens on the board recursively.

The main function initializes an empty board and calls the `place_queens` function to place the queens on the board. It then converts the indices of each configuration to actual board configurations by replacing the queen's position with 'Q' and the rest with '.'. The final result is returned as a list of all possible configurations where the queens are placed.

    """
    Multiply two matrices.

    if arr1.shape[1] != arr2.shape[0]:
        raise ValueError("Matrix dimensions are incompatible for multiplication.")

    # Perform matrix multiplication using NumPy's matmul function
    product = np.matmul(arr1, arr2)

    # Convert result back to a list of lists and return it
    return product.tolist()
```

However, if you want to implement the matrix multiplication manually without using NumPy, here is how you can do it:

```python
from typing import List

def matrix_multiply(matrix1: List[List[int]], matrix2: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Multiply two matrices.

    Args:

    # Check if the number of columns in the first array is equal to the number of rows in the second array
    if cols_matrix1 != rows_matrix2:
        raise ValueError("Matrix dimensions are incompatible for multiplication.")

    # Initialize result matrix with zeros
    product = [[0 for _ in range(cols_matrix2)] for _ in range(rows_matrix1)]

    # Perform matrix multiplication manually
    for i in range(rows_matrix1):
        for j in range(cols_matrix2):
            for k in range(cols_matrix1):  # Note: cols_matrix1, not rows_matrix1
                product[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j]

    return product
```

Example usage:

```python
matrix_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
matrix_b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

result = matrix_multiply(matrix_a, matrix_b)
for row in result:

    Generate all combinations of a given list.

    Args:
        items (List[Any]): The input list.

    Returns:
        List[List[Any]]: A list of lists, where each sublist is a combination of the input list.
    """

    # Initialize an empty list to store combinations
    combinations = []

    # Use itertools.combinations to generate all combinations
    for r in range(len(items) + 1):
        # Add each generated combination to the result list
        combinations.extend(itertools.combinations(items, r))

    return combinations

# Example usage:
items = ['a', 'b', 'c']

print(result)

# Output:
# [('',), ('a',), ('b',), ('c',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c'), 
#  ('a', 'b', 'c')]
```

This function uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible combinations of the input list. It then iterates over a range from 0 (empty combination) up to the length of the input list, adding each generated combination to the result.

Please note that this implementation has an exponential time complexity due to the nature of generating all combinations. For very large lists, you may want to consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures if possible.

```

This implementation uses a binary tree to store the sums of all possible ranges in the input array. The `build_tree` function constructs this tree by recursively calculating the sum for each range and storing it at its corresponding node. The `update` function updates a specific value in the array and propagates the changes up the tree, ensuring that the sum at each node remains correct. Finally, the `query` function uses this tree to calculate the sum of any specified range.

You can use the SegmentTree class as follows:

```python
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
tree = SegmentTree(arr)
print(tree.query(0, 2))  # Output: 9 (sum of first three elements)
tree.update(2, 6)  # Update middle element to 6
print(tree.query(1, 4))  # Output: 20 (sum of last four elements)
```
<end>Count vowels in a string in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that counts the number of vowels in a given string:

```python
def count_vowels(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Count the number of vowels in a string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to count vowels from.

    Returns:
        int: The total count of vowels in the string.
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return sum(1 for char in s if char in vowels)
```

Here's an explanation of how this function works:

- We define a string `vowels` that contains all possible vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).
- The expression `sum(1 for char in s if char in vowels)` is a generator expression that iterates over each character `char` in the input string `s`.
- For each character, we check if it's present in the `vowels` string. If it is (i.e., it's a vowel), we count it by adding 1 to the sum.
- The final result is returned as an integer.

Example usage:

```python
print(count_vowels("Hello World"))  # Output: 3
print(count_vowels("AEIOUaeiou"))  # Output: 10
```

This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, making it efficient for large inputs.

    """
    Check if a number is prime.

    # If no divisors are found, the number is prime
    return True
```

Example usage:

print(is_prime(25))   # Output: False (because 25 has factors 5 and 5)
print(is_prime(23))   # Output: True
print(is_prime(37))   # Output: True
print(is_prime(48))   # Output: False (because 48 has factors 6 and 8)
```

This implementation takes advantage of the fact that a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked. The loop only needs to iterate up to the square root of `n`, making it more efficient for larger numbers.

    return [p for p in range(2, n + 1) if prime[p]]

# Example usage:
print(sieve_of_eratosthenes(30))
```

In this function:

*   We initialize a boolean array `prime` of size `n+1`, assuming all numbers are prime initially.
*   We iterate over potential prime numbers starting from 2 and mark their multiples as non-prime (False).
*   Finally, we return a list of indices where `prime[j]` is True, which corresponds to the prime numbers up to `n`.

The function's time complexity is O(n log log n) and space complexity is O(n), making it efficient for large inputs.
<end>Append to a file in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that appends content to a file:

```python
def append_to_file(file_path: str, content: str) -> None:
    """
    Appends content to a specified file.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file.
        content (str): The content to be appended.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    try:
        with open(file_path, 'a') as f:

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file {file_path} was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

- The `try` block attempts to open the file in append mode (`'a'`) using a `with` statement, which ensures that the file is properly closed when we're done with it.
- We then write the content to be appended, followed by a newline character (`'\n'`), to the file using the `write()` method.
- The function includes two `except` blocks to catch any potential exceptions:
  - If the specified file does not exist (i.e., a `FileNotFoundError` is raised), we print an error message indicating that the file was not found.
  - For any other exception, we print a generic error message along with the specific exception.

You can use this function like this:

```python
append_to_file('example.txt', 'Hello, world!')
```

This would append the string `'Hello, world!'` followed by a newline character to `example.txt`. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
<end>Write to a file in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that writes to a file:

        None
    """
    try:

            file.write(content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This function opens the specified `file_path` in write mode (`'w'`) and writes the provided `content`. If an exception occurs during this process, it will be caught by the `try/except` block and printed to the console.
<end>Read user input in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python function that meets the requirements:

```python
def get_user_input(prompt: str) -> str:
    """

        prompt (str): The prompt to display to the user.

    Returns:
        str: The user's input.
    """
    return input(prompt)
```

This function uses the built-in `input` function in Python to read user input. It takes a single argument, `prompt`, which is displayed to the user before they are prompted to enter their input. The user's input is then returned as a string.

You can use this function like so:

```python
user_input = get_user_input("Please enter your name: ")
print(user_input)
```

This will display "Please enter your name: " and wait for the user to enter something, then print out what they entered.

        List[int]: A list containing the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")

        return [0, 1]

    # Initialize the Fibonacci sequence with the first two numbers
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    # Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number
    for i in range(2, n):
        # Append the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])

    return fib_sequence
```

Here's an example use case:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

This function uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. It handles edge cases for `n = 1` and `n = 2`, and raises an error if `n <= 0`.

    """

    # Iterate over each element in the array

        # Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
                
        # Swap the found minimum element with the current last element
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
        
    return arr

# Example usage:
numbers = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
sorted_numbers = selection_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_numbers)
```

This implementation of the `selection_sort` function sorts an input list using the Selection Sort algorithm. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) in all cases (best, average, worst), where n is the number of elements in the input list.

The provided example usage demonstrates how to use the `selection_sort` function with a sample array and print out the sorted result.

    """

    # Initialize the maximum current sum and maximum global sum to the first element in the array
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]

    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1)

        # Update the maximum current sum to be the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous maximum current sum
        max_current = max(num, max_current + num)

        # Update the maximum global sum to be the maximum of the current maximum global sum and the maximum current sum
        max_global = max(max_global, max_current)

    # Return the maximum global sum
    return max_global

# Example usage:
arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
print(kadanes_algorithm(arr))  # Output: 7
```

This function iterates over each element in the array and maintains two sums:

*   `max_current`: The maximum sum of a subarray ending at the current position.
*   `max_global`: The maximum sum of any subarray seen so far.

After iterating through the entire array, `max_global` holds the maximum sum of any subarray within the original array.

        str: The decrypted text.
    """

    # We want to shift each letter back by 'shift' places
    decrypted_text = ""

    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97

            # Calculate the new character's ASCII value after shifting back
            new_char_value = (ord(char) - ascii_offset - shift) % 26 + ascii_offset
            
            # Convert the ASCII value back to a character
            decrypted_text += chr(new_char_value)
        else:
            # If the character is not a letter, just append it as is
            decrypted_text += char

    return decrypted_text
```

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. The function iterates over each character in the input `text`.
2. For each character, it checks if it's a letter (using the `isalpha()` method).
3. If it is a letter, it calculates the new character value after shifting back by subtracting the shift value and taking the modulus with 26 to wrap around the alphabet.
4. It then converts this new ASCII value back to a character using `chr()`.
5. If the character isn't a letter (e.g., punctuation, whitespace), it simply appends it as is to the output string.

You can use this function like so:

```python
encrypted_text = "Khoor Wklv Dvhn"
shift_value = 3

decrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(encrypted_text, shift_value)
print(decrypted_text)  # Output: This Is Cool
```

Note that the `caesar_encrypt()` function wasn't provided in your prompt, so I assumed it was already implemented elsewhere.

    if root == p or root == q:
        return root
    
    # Recursively search for p and q in left and right subtrees
    left_lca = lowest_common_ancestor(root.left, p, q)
    right_lca = lowest_common_ancestor(root.right, p, q)

    # If both left and right LCA are not None, it means p and q are on different sides of the current node,
    # so the current node is the LCA
    if left_lca and right_lca:

    # Otherwise, one of the subtrees contains both p and q, so we return its LCA (or one of them if it's not None)
    return left_lca or right_lca
```

This function works by recursively traversing the binary tree until it finds either `p` or `q`, and returns that node as the LCA. If both nodes are found in different subtrees, it means they're on different sides of the current node, making it the LCA.

Example use case:

```python
# Create a sample binary tree:

    This function finds the maximum value in a given list of integers.

    Args:
        numbers (List[int]): A list of integer values.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum value found in the list.
    """

    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")

    # Use built-in max() function to find the maximum value in the list
    return max(numbers)
```

Here's an explanation of how this code works:

* We first import the necessary type from `typing` module.
* In the `find_max()` function, we check if the input `numbers` list is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` exception is raised because we cannot find the maximum value in an empty list.
* If the input list is not empty, we use Python's built-in `max()` function to find the largest value in the list and return it.

You can call this function with a sample list of integers like so:

```python
numbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56]
print(find_max(numbers))  # Outputs: 56
```

This code should be efficient because the `max()` function in Python uses Timsort under the hood which has an average time complexity of O(n log n).
<end>Calculate edit distance between strings in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that calculates the edit distance between two strings using dynamic programming:

```python
def edit_distance(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the edit distance between two strings.
    
    The edit distance is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions)
    required to change one string into another.

    Args:
        s1 (str): The first string.
        s2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        int: The edit distance between the two strings.
    """

    # Initialize a matrix to store the edit distances for subproblems
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Fill in the base cases: transforming an empty string to another is equivalent to inserting all characters from that string
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i

    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j

    # Fill in the rest of the matrix using the recurrence relation: min(insert, delete, substitute) + 1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1])

    # The edit distance is stored in the bottom-right corner of the matrix
    return dp[m][n]
```

This function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the edit distance. It initializes a matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of string `s1` and the first `j` characters of string `s2`. The base cases are when one or both strings are empty, in which case the edit distance is equal to the length of the non-empty string. The rest of the matrix is filled using the recurrence relation: for each pair of characters, if they match, there's no operation needed, so we take the minimum edit distance from the subproblem `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`. If they don't match, we consider three operations: insertion (taking the minimum edit distance from `dp[i][j - 1]`), deletion (taking the minimum edit distance from `dp[i - 1][j]`), and substitution (taking the minimum edit distance from `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`) + 1, which we add to take into account that one character was substituted. The final result is stored in the bottom-right corner of the matrix.

Example use cases:

```python
print(edit_distance("kitten", "sitting")) # Output: 3
print(edit_distance("", "")) # Output: 0
print(edit_distance("abc", "def")) # Output: 6
```
<end>Find union of two lists in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that finds the union of two lists using a set:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def find_union(list1: List[Any], list2: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Find the union of two lists.

    Args:
        list1 (List[Any]): The first list.
        list2 (List[Any]): The second list.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: The union of list1 and list2.
    """
    return list(set(list1 + list2))
```

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

- We convert both lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicates. 
- We then combine these two sets using the `+` operator, which effectively gives us a set that contains all elements from both sets.
- Finally, we convert this combined set back into a list and return it.

Example usage:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

print(find_union(list1, list2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

This function assumes that the elements of the input lists are hashable (i.e., they can be added to a set). If you're working with unhashable types (like lists or dictionaries), you'll need to use a different approach.

This implementation uses a list as the internal data structure to store the elements in the queue. The `enqueue` method adds an element to the end of the list, while the `dequeue` and `front` methods operate at the front of the list using `pop(0)` and indexing respectively. The `is_empty` method simply checks if the length of the internal list is zero.

In this function, we use Python's built-in `str.maketrans()` method to create a translation table that maps each letter shifted by 13 places in the ASCII table. This is equivalent to applying ROT13 to each letter in the input string.

We then use the `str.translate()` method to apply this translation table to the input string, effectively decoding it from ROT13.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(rot13_decode("Uryyb Jbeyq"))  # Output: "Hello World"

# Output: 8

ft.update(1, -2)
print(ft.query(10))
# Output: 7
```

This implementation uses a list `bit` to store the Fenwick tree data. The `update` method adds a value at a given index by iterating up the tree and adding the difference between the new value and the old value at each node. The `query` method calculates the sum of all values in a range `[0, end]` by summing the values in the Fenwick tree up to the end of the range.

The time complexity for both `update` and `query` operations is O(log n), where n is the size of the Fenwick tree.
<end>Convert fahrenheit to celsius in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius:

```python
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit: float) -> float:
    """
    Converts Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius.

    Args:
        fahrenheit (float): Temperature in Fahrenheit.

    Returns:
        float: Temperature in Celsius.
    """
    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
    return celsius
```

Example usage:

```python
print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(100))  # Output: 37.77777777777778
```
<end>Generate UUID in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented Python function that generates a random UUID:

```python
import uuid

def generate_uuid() -> str:
    """
    Generates a random UUID.

    Returns:
        str: A randomly generated UUID.
    """
    return str(uuid.uuid4())
```

This function uses the `uuid` module's `uuid4()` method, which is designed for generating random UUIDs. The result is converted to a string and returned by the function.

You can use this function like this:

```python
new_uuid = generate_uuid()
print(new_uuid)
```

This will output a randomly generated UUID, something like this: `'6c7b5e9f-11d4-e2a3-4c55-b2d1adbb1fac'`.
<end>Convert string to uppercase in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that converts a string to uppercase:

```python
def to_uppercase(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Converts a given string to uppercase.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to convert.

    Returns:
        str: The converted uppercase string.
    """
    return s.upper()
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
input_str = "Hello, World!"
print(to_uppercase(input_str))  # Outputs: HELLO, WORLD!
```

This function uses the built-in `upper()` method of Python strings to convert the input string to uppercase.
<end>Split string into list in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that splits a string into a list using a specified delimiter:

```python
from typing import List

def split_string(s: str, delimiter: str = ' ') -> List[str]:
    """
    Split a string into a list using a specified delimiter.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
        delimiter (str, optional): The delimiter to split the string by. Defaults to ' '.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of strings split from the original string.
    """
    return s.split(delimiter)
```

This function uses Python's built-in `split()` method, which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The delimiter can be any type of character or combination of characters.

**Example Use Cases:**

```python
# Split a string using the default delimiter (' ')
print(split_string('hello world'))  # Output: ['hello', 'world']

# Split a string using a custom delimiter (',' in this case)
print(split_string('apple,banana,cherry', ','))  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

This function can be reused with different input strings and delimiters.
<end>Convert RGB to HEX color in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that performs the task:

```python
def rgb_to_hex(r: int, g: int, b: int) -> str:
    """
    Convert RGB color values to HEX.

    Args:
        r (int): The red component value.
        g (int): The green component value.
        b (int): The blue component value.

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the HEX color code.
    """
    return f"#{r:02x}{g:02x}{b:02x}"
```

Here's how it works:

- We use Python's built-in string formatting feature to create a string in the format `#RRGGBB`, where each pair of hexadecimal digits represents a color component.
- The `:02x` part is a formatting specifier that means:
  - `0`: Pad the number with zeros if necessary
  - `2`: Make sure the padded width is at least 2 characters
  - `x`: Format as lowercase hexadecimal
- We use an f-string to insert the formatted color values into the string.

Example usage:

```python
print(rgb_to_hex(255, 0, 0))  # Output: #ff0000 (red)
print(rgb_to_hex(0, 128, 0))  # Output: #008000 (green)
```

This function is concise and readable. It's also well-documented with a docstring that explains what it does, its parameters, and its return value.
<end>Generate a password in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that generates a random password of a specified length:

```python
import secrets
import string

def generate_password(length: int) -> str:
    """
    Generates a random password of the specified length.

    Args:
        length (int): The desired length of the password.

    Returns:
        str: A randomly generated password.
    """

    # Define the character set to use for password generation
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

    # Ensure the password has at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
    if length < 3:
        raise ValueError("Password must be at least 3 characters long")

    # Generate the password
    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))

    return password

# Example usage:
print(generate_password(12))
```

In this function, `secrets` is used instead of `random` to generate cryptographically secure passwords. The `string` module's constants (`ascii_letters`, `digits`, and `punctuation`) are combined to create a set of characters from which the password will be chosen.

Note that I added a check to ensure the generated password has at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit, as per common password guidelines. If you'd like to change this behavior, simply remove or modify the `if` statement.

            if is_valid_ip(segment):
                backtrack(end, path + [segment])

    result = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

The `generate_ip_addresses` function uses a helper function called `is_valid_ip` to check if each segment of the IP address is valid. The function takes three parameters: `start`, which is the starting index for the next segment; and `path`, which is the current path of IP addresses.

In the main function, we initialize an empty list `result` to store all possible valid IP addresses. We then start a backtracking process from index 0 with an empty path.

The `backtrack` function iterates over each possible segment starting at the given index, and for each segment that is valid according to the `is_valid_ip` function, it recursively calls itself with the next index and updated path.

Finally, we return the list of all possible valid IP addresses.

Here's an example usage:

```python
ip_addresses = generate_ip_addresses("25525511135")
print(ip_addresses)
```

This will output a list containing all possible valid IP addresses for the given string.
<end>Find median of two sorted arrays in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that finds the median of two sorted arrays:

```python
from typing import List

def median_of_sorted_arrays(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
    """
    Find the median of two sorted arrays.

    Args:
        nums1 (List[int]): The first sorted array.
        nums2 (List[int]): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the combined array.
    """

    # Combine the two arrays into one
    combined = sorted(nums1 + nums2)

    # Calculate the length of the combined array
    n = len(combined)

    # If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (combined[n // 2 - 1] + combined[n // 2]) / 2

    # If the length is odd, the median is the middle number
    else:
        return combined[n // 2]
```

Here's an explanation of how this function works:

1. We first combine the two input arrays into one by concatenating them and sorting the result.
2. Next, we calculate the length of the combined array.
3. If the length is even, we find the two middle numbers (at indices `n // 2 - 1` and `n // 2`) and return their average as the median.
4. If the length is odd, we simply return the middle number.

This function assumes that the input arrays are sorted in ascending order. If they are not, you will need to sort them first before calling this function.

Example usage:

```python
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

print(median_of_sorted_arrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2

nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

print(median_of_sorted_arrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2.5
```

Note that this function has a time complexity of O((m + n) log (m + n)), where m and n are the lengths of the input arrays. This is because we sort the combined array. If you need to optimize for large inputs, you can use a different approach, such as using binary search to find the median without sorting the entire array.
<end>Transpose a matrix in Python.<start>Here is a high-quality Python function that transposes a matrix:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def transpose_matrix(matrix: List[List[Any]]) -> List[List[Any]]:
    """

    Args:
        matrix (List[List[Any]]): A 2D list representing the matrix.

    Returns:

    """

    # Check if the input is a valid matrix
    if not all(len(row) == len(matrix[0]) for row in matrix):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a rectangular matrix")

    # Use the built-in zip function with reversed to transpose the matrix
    return list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))
```

This function first checks if the input is a valid rectangular matrix. If it's not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it uses the built-in `zip` function in combination with the `*` operator (which unpacks the arguments) to transpose the matrix. The result is converted back into lists using the `map` and `list` functions.

Example usage:

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]

transposed_matrix = transpose_matrix(matrix)
print(transposed_matrix)  # Output: [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
```

This function assumes that the input matrix is a list of lists where each inner list has the same length (i.e., it's a rectangular matrix). If you have matrices with different row lengths and want to transpose them as well, you'll need to modify this function accordingly.
<end>Implement quick sort in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that implements Quick Sort:

```python
from typing import List

def quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function performs a Quick Sort on a given list of integers.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): The input list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A new list containing the elements in ascending order.
    """

    # Base case: If the array has 1 or fewer elements, it's already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Select a pivot element (in this case, the middle element)
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]

    # Create three lists: elements less than the pivot, equal to the pivot,
    # and greater than the pivot.
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    # Recursively sort the sublists and combine them
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
```

Example usage:

```python
numbers = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 9]
sorted_numbers = quick_sort(numbers)

print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10]
```

This Quick Sort implementation has an average time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. However, it can have a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) if the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted in either ascending or descending order. This is because the selection of the pivot element can lead to poor partitioning in these cases.
<end>Find intersection of two lists in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that finds the intersection of two lists:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def find_intersection(list1: List[Any], list2: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    This function returns a new list containing elements common to both input lists.

    Args:
        list1 (List[Any]): The first list.
        list2 (List[Any]): The second list.

    Returns:
        List[Any]: A new list containing the intersection of list1 and list2.
    """
    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))
```

Here's an explanation of how it works:

- We use Python's built-in `set` data structure to convert each input list into a set. This is because sets in Python have a built-in method for finding the intersection (i.e., the elements common to both).
- The `&` operator is used to find the intersection between the two sets.
- Finally, we use the `list()` function to convert this resulting set back into a list, which is then returned by our function.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

```python
# Test lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Call the function
intersection = find_intersection(list1, list2)

print(intersection)  # Output: [4, 5]
```
<end>Find kth largest element in array in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that finds the kth largest element in an array using the `heapq` module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

def find_kth_largest(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    """
    Find the kth largest element in an array.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
        k (int): The position of the element to find (1-indexed).

    Returns:
        int: The kth largest element in the array.
    """

    # Use heapq.nlargest to get the k largest elements
    k_largest = heapq.nlargest(k, nums)

    # The kth largest element is the last element in the list
    return k_largest[-1]
```

However, this solution may not be efficient for large inputs because `heapq.nlargest` creates a new list of length `k`, which can be expensive.

A more efficient solution would be to use the QuickSelect algorithm, also known as the Median of Medians algorithm. Here's how you could implement it:

```python
import random

def find_kth_largest(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    """
    Find the kth largest element in an array.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
        k (int): The position of the element to find (1-indexed).

    Returns:
        int: The kth largest element in the array.
    """

    # Use QuickSelect algorithm
    return quickselect(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) - k)
```

And here's how you could implement the QuickSelect function:

```python
def quickselect(nums: List[int], low: int, high: int, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Find the kth largest element in an array using QuickSelect algorithm.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
        low (int): The lower index of the current range.
        high (int): The higher index of the current range.
        k (int): The position of the element to find (0-indexed).

    Returns:
        int: The kth largest element in the array.
    """

    # Select a pivot randomly
    pivot_index = random.randint(low, high)

    # Partition around the pivot and get the index where the pivot should be
    pivot_index = partition(nums, low, high, pivot_index)

    # If the pivot is at the desired position, return it
    if k == pivot_index:
        return nums[k]

    # Recursively search in the other half
    elif k < pivot_index:
        return quickselect(nums, low, pivot_index - 1, k)
    else:
        return quickselect(nums, pivot_index + 1, high, k)
```

And here's how you could implement the partition function:

```python
def partition(nums: List[int], low: int, high: int, pivot_index: int) -> int:
    """
    Partition an array around a given index using QuickSelect algorithm.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
        low (int): The lower index of the current range.
        high (int): The higher index of the current range.
        pivot_index (int): The index to partition around.

    Returns:
        int: The final position of the pivot element.
    """

    # Swap the pivot with the last element
    nums[pivot_index], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[pivot_index]

    # Get the correct position for the pivot
    i = low - 1

    # Partition around the pivot
    for j in range(low, high):
        if nums[j] < nums[high]:
            i += 1
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]

    # Swap the pivot with the element at its correct position
    nums[i + 1], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i + 1]

    return i + 1
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and is much more efficient than the previous one.
<end>Calculate Fibonacci number using recursion in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:

```python
def fibonacci_recursive(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

    Args:
        n (int): The position of the Fibonacci number to calculate.

    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number.
    """
    # Base cases
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Input should be a positive integer.")
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1

    # Recursive case
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number. It uses recursion to calculate this value.

However, please note that this recursive approach is not efficient for large values of `n`, because it performs a lot of repeated calculations. A more efficient solution would use dynamic programming or memoization to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.

Here's an example usage:

```python
print(fibonacci_recursive(10))  # Output: 55
```

Also, keep in mind that the provided function does not include any error handling for negative inputs. If you want to handle such cases, consider raising a `ValueError` like this:

```python
if n < 0:
    raise ValueError("Input should be a non-negative integer.")
```
<end>Implement Bloom filter in Python.<start>Here's the implementation of the Bloom filter in Python:

```python
from typing import List, Callable, Any

class BloomFilter:
    """
    A space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

    Attributes:
        size (int): The size of the bit array.
        hash_functions (List[Callable]): A list of hash functions to use for insertion and lookup.
        bits (List[int]): The underlying bit array.
    """

    def __init__(self, size: int, hash_functions: List[Callable]):
        """
        Initialize the Bloom filter.

        Args:
            size (int): The size of the bit array.
            hash_functions (List[Callable]): A list of hash functions to use for insertion and lookup.
        """
        self.size = size
        self.hash_functions = hash_functions
        self.bits = [False] * size

    def add(self, item: Any) -> None:
        """
        Add an item to the Bloom filter.

        Args:
            item (Any): The item to add.
        """
        for func in self.hash_functions:
            index = func(item) % self.size
            self.bits[index] = True

    def contains(self, item: Any) -> bool:
        """
        Check if an item is likely to be a member of the set.

        Args:
            item (Any): The item to check for.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the item might be in the filter, False otherwise.
        """
        for func in self.hash_functions:
            index = func(item) % self.size
            if not self.bits[index]:
                return False
        return True

# Example usage:

class HashFunction1:
    def __call__(self, x: int):
        return x + 12345

class HashFunction2:
    def __call__(self, x: int):
        return (x * x) % 1000007

bloom_filter = BloomFilter(size=10**6, hash_functions=[HashFunction1(), HashFunction2()])
bloom_filter.add("example")

print(bloom_filter.contains("example")) # Might be True
print(bloom_filter.contains("different_example")) # Will likely be False
```

In this code:

- The `BloomFilter` class is initialized with a bit array of size `size`, and a list of hash functions.
- The `add` method adds an item to the filter by applying each hash function, and setting the corresponding bits in the bit array to True.
- The `contains` method checks if an item might be in the filter. If all hash values fall into the set of previously inserted items, then it returns True; otherwise, False.

Please note that using a Bloom filter is not a definitive way to determine whether an element is present or absent from a set. Instead, it's used as a probabilistic data structure for efficient lookup operations with low memory usage. It can produce false positives (falsely indicating the presence of an item in the set), but never false negatives. The accuracy of the Bloom filter improves as more items are added to the set.

Also note that you might need to modify the `size` and the number of hash functions according to your specific use case, to achieve a good trade-off between memory usage and accuracy.
<end>Find longest increasing subsequence in Python.<start>Here is a Python function that implements the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm using dynamic programming. This problem has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array.

```python
from typing import List

def longest_increasing_subsequence(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Find the longest increasing subsequence in the given array.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): The input array.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The longest increasing subsequence.
    """

    # If the input array is empty, return an empty list
    if not arr:
        return []

    # Initialize a table to store the length of LIS ending at each position
    dp = [1] * len(arr)

    # Initialize a table to store the previous element in the LIS
    prev = [-1] * len(arr)

    # Initialize the maximum length of LIS and its ending index
    max_len = 1
    end_idx = 0

    # Iterate over the array from left to right
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                # If a longer increasing subsequence is found, update dp and prev tables
                if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                    prev[i] = j

        # Update max_len and end_idx if a longer LIS is found
        if dp[i] > max_len:
            max_len = dp[i]
            end_idx = i

    # Build the longest increasing subsequence using the prev table
    lis = []
    idx = end_idx
    while idx != -1:
        lis.append(arr[idx])
        idx = prev[idx]

    return lis[::-1]  # Return the LIS in the correct order
```

Example use case:

```python
arr = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]
print(longest_increasing_subsequence(arr))  # Output: [10, 22, 33, 50, 60]
```

This code defines a function `longest_increasing_subsequence` that takes an array as input and returns its longest increasing subsequence. The function uses dynamic programming to build two tables: `dp` stores the length of LIS ending at each position, and `prev` stores the previous element in the LIS. The maximum length of LIS and its ending index are tracked separately. Finally, the code builds the longest increasing subsequence using the `prev` table and returns it as a list in reverse order (since Python lists are 0-indexed).
<end>Read a file in Python.<start>Here is the Python function that reads a file:

```python
def read_file(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Reads the content of a file.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file to be read.

    Returns:
        str: The content of the file as a string.
    """

    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File {file_path} not found.")
        return None
```

This function opens the specified file in read mode ('r'), reads its content, and returns it as a string. If the file does not exist, it catches the `FileNotFoundError` exception, prints an error message, and returns `None`. 

Please note that this function assumes you are working with text files. For binary files (like images or videos), you would need to use a different mode when opening the file.
<end>Implement a simple address book with contacts using a Python class.<start>**AddressBook Class Example**
