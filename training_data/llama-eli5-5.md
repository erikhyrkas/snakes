Explain vegetables like I'm five years old.<start>VEGETABLES ARE YUMMY!

So, you know how we eat fruits like apples and bananas? Well, vegetables are like special kinds of food that grow from the ground! Just like how trees grow fruit, plants grow veggies.

Let me tell you about some yummy veggies:

* Carrots are long and orange. They're good for your eyes!
* Broccoli is a green tree-like thing with little flowers on it. It's super good for you and makes you strong!
* Tomatoes are actually fruits (but we call them veggies!), they're red and juicy, and you can eat them in salads or sandwiches.
* Peas are tiny and sweet, you can eat them straight from the pod!
* Cucumbers are long and green, they're super refreshing and good for hot summer days.

Vegetables come in all shapes and sizes, but they're all delicious! And remember, eating veggies will make you strong and healthy, just like superheroes!

Which veggie is your favorite?

Explain airplanes like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about AIRPLANES!

An airplane is a special kind of machine that can take people and things up high in the sky!

Imagine you're on a big bus, but instead of driving on roads, it gets to FLY! It has wings, like a bird, but they're not made of feathers. They're made of strong metal and fabric.

When an airplane wants to fly, it goes VROOOM (like a big car) on the special road called a runway. Then, when it's going fast enough, it lifts up into the air! It's like magic!

The people who fly in airplanes are called pilots. They're super smart and kind, and they make sure everyone gets to their destination safely.

Airplanes have seats for people, just like a bus, but they also have special things like food and drinks, and even games and movies! Some airplanes are big enough to take hundreds of people on fun adventures!

And the best part? When you fly in an airplane, you get to see the WORLD from up high! You can see trees, houses, lakes, and even other airplanes flying around!

Isn't that AMAZING?!

Explain cryptocurrencies like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you going to love this!

You know how we use money to buy things we want and need? Like toys and candy?

Well, cryptocurrencies are a special kind of money that exists only on computers and phones. It's like the money in your piggy bank, but instead of being made of coins and bills, it's made of computer code.

Just like how you can save your allowance in your piggy bank, people can save their cryptocurrency in a special kind of computer program called a "wallet". And just like how you can use your money to buy things you want, people can use their cryptocurrency to buy things they want online, like video games or music.

But here's the really cool thing about cryptocurrencies: nobody owns them! They're not controlled by governments or banks. It's like a secret handshake between all the people who have it, where everyone agrees on what the rules are and how much of it there is.

And because it's only on computers and phones, you can use it to buy things from anywhere in the world, without needing a bank or a government to help you. Isn't that awesome?

The most famous kind of cryptocurrency is called Bitcoin (say "bit-coin"). It was invented by a person who wanted to create a new way for people to send money online, and it's been growing ever since.

So, that's what cryptocurrencies are! Do you want to be a cryptocurrency millionaire when you grow up?

Explain voting like I'm five years old.<start>Voting is when grown-ups get to help decide big decisions for their community, country, or even the whole world!

Imagine you're in a classroom with all your friends, and you have to decide what game to play at recess. There are lots of games to choose from, like tag, soccer, or hide-and-seek.

Each of your friends gets one special vote. When it's your turn to vote, you get to pick the game you want to play. You can't change your mind later, but you got to make a choice.

The same thing happens in voting for grown-ups. They get to choose who will be their leaders or what laws they'll follow. It's like choosing which game to play at recess, but for bigger decisions that affect everyone!

Here are some cool things about voting:

* Everyone gets one vote, no matter how old they are.
* You can't just decide on your own; you have to work together with your friends (or in this case, other voters).
* The person or law with the most votes usually wins!
* Voting is like a special way of saying "I care" about what happens in our community.

So, voting is super important because it helps grown-ups make decisions that affect everyone. And just like choosing a game at recess, it's one of those cool things we get to do as a team!
<end>

Explain data science like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain what data science is in a super fun way!

Imagine you have a lemonade stand, and you want to know how many people will come to buy lemonade from you on a hot summer day.

**Data**: That's like the cups of lemonade you sell each day (or not!). It's the information about your business that helps you understand what's happening.

**Science**: This is like being a detective and trying to figure out why something happens. You want to find answers to questions like: "Why do some days have more customers than others?" or "What time of day should I sell lemonade?"

**Data Science**: It's like using special tools and tricks (like computers and math) to help you make sense of the data (cups of lemonade). A data scientist is like a super cool detective who looks at all the data, figures out what it means, and gives you answers to your questions!

For example:

* They might look at how many cups of lemonade are sold on different days of the week.
* They might see that more people buy lemonade when there's a big parade in town (so you should sell more lemonade on those days!).
* Or they might notice that if you charge 50 cents per cup instead of 75 cents, more people will come to buy it!

By looking at the data and using science, a data scientist helps you make better decisions about your business, like how much lemonade to make or when to have special deals.

That's basically what data science is – using math, computers, and detective skills to help us understand and make sense of information!
<end>

Explain statistics like I'm five years old.<start>STATISTICS ARE FUN!

So, you know how sometimes we have a lot of things to count? Like toys or stickers?

Imagine you have 10 boxes of crayons in your classroom. And inside each box, there are a different number of crayons.

Some boxes have 5 crayons, some have 6, and some have even more! But if we wanted to know how many crayons are in all the boxes together, what would we do?

That's where statistics comes in!

**Measuring things**

Statistics is like taking a special kind of picture with numbers. We count up all the crayons in each box, and then we add them all up together.

So, let's say:

* Box 1 has 5 crayons
* Box 2 has 6 crayons
* Box 3 has 7 crayons

We can add these numbers up to get a total: 5 + 6 + 7 = 18

**Finding patterns**

But that's not all! Statistics also helps us find patterns. Like, if we counted the number of crayons in each box and got:

* Box 1: 5 crayons
* Box 2: 5 crayons
* Box 3: 5 crayons

We might say, "Hey, most boxes have 5 crayons!"

**Making good decisions**

Statistics helps us make smart choices. Like, if we knew how many crayons were in each box, we could decide how to share them fairly among the whole class.

So, statistics is like a special tool that helps us count and understand things, find patterns, and make better decisions!

Wow, you're so smart! Do you have any questions about statistics now?
<end>

Explain asteroids like I'm five years old.<start>Asteroids are so much fun!

You know how we live on a big planet called Earth, right? Well, there are lots of other planets and things floating around in space. And sometimes, when rocks from those other places break apart or get kicked out into space, they can become tiny pieces called asteroids.

These asteroids are like really small rocks that are floating around in space. They're not big enough to be planets, but they're too big to just burn up and disappear. Some of them are even close to our Earth!

Imagine you're playing with a bunch of marbles on the playground. If one of those marbles got shot out into space, it would keep floating around until something else bumped into it or it got pulled back down by gravity.

That's kind of like what asteroids do! They just float around in space, sometimes coming close to our planet. But don't worry, most of them are really far away and won't hurt us. Some scientists even think that maybe one day we can visit some of these asteroids!

So, that's what asteroids are like – tiny rocks floating around in space!
<end>

Explain the Theory of Relativity like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about a big idea called the Theory of Relativity!

You know how sometimes you're on a train, and it feels like the trees outside are moving really fast? But if you ask your friend who is standing next to the trees, they'll say that YOU'RE the one moving really fast, not the trees!

That's kind of what Albert Einstein said: that how we see things can depend on how we're moving. If you're on a train and it's going very fast, time might seem to go by a little bit slower for you compared to someone who is standing still outside.

Imagine you have two friends, Timmy and Emma. They both have a toy car, and they start the car at exactly the same time. But Timmy is on a super-fast train, and Emma is just standing still.

When the cars finish racing, Timmy says his car went really fast, but Emma says her car went even faster! Who's right?

The answer is... both of them are right! It depends on how they're moving. For Timmy on the train, it felt like time was going by slowly, so his toy car seemed to go really fast. But for Emma standing still, it felt like her toy car went super fast because time was passing normally.

That's basically what Einstein said: that time and space can be different depending on how we're moving. Isn't that cool?

Now, don't worry if your brain gets a little mixed up – it's a pretty big idea! But the main thing to remember is that how we see things can depend on how we're moving.
<end>

Explain the south pole like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about the South Pole!

So, you know how we live on a big planet called Earth, right? And Earth is shaped like a ball, but it's not a perfect sphere. It's kind of like a big beach ball that's been squished a little bit.

The South Pole is one of the two "poles" on our planet (the other one is the North Pole). It's located at the very bottom part of the Earth, which means if you imagine a big globe, it's where your finger would go if you tried to reach down and touch the bottom!

The South Pole is special because it's really, really cold there. We're talking -40°F (-40°C) or colder! That's even colder than your freezer at home.

There are also some really cool things about the South Pole:

* It's covered in ice and snow all year round.
* There's a huge continent called Antarctica surrounding the South Pole.
* You can see the entire sky when you're there, because it's so far from any cities or buildings that the light pollution (which makes stars hard to see) is super low.

Imagine going on an adventure to the bottom of the Earth! That's what scientists and explorers do when they go to the South Pole. They get to study the ice, play with penguins, and even have some fun in the snow!

How was that? Did I explain the South Pole in a way that makes sense to you?
<end>

Explain ozone like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about OZONE!

So, you know how sometimes it gets really hot outside and the air can feel yucky? That's because there are bad things in the air called pollutants.

Well, ozone is a superhero that helps clean up those bad things! It's like a special kind of medicine for the air.

Ozone is made when good guys in the air, like sunlight and oxygen, mix together. And it makes a special kind of magic happen!

When ozone is around, it helps keep us safe by:

* Making the air feel fresher
* Stopping bad things from hurting our bodies
* Even helping to prevent yucky thunderstorms!

But here's the thing: sometimes there can be too much ozone in the air. That's called "bad ozone." It's like having too many superheroes - it can cause problems!

So, we need just the right amount of ozone to stay safe and healthy.

Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about ozone now?
<end>

Explain fossils like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about FOSSILS!

A long, long time ago (even before your grandparents were born!), there were lots of cool creatures on Earth, like dinosaurs and other animals that we don't see today.

When these creatures died, their bodies started to get eaten away by tiny bugs, worms, and other little critters. But some parts of their bodies got squished and pressed into a special kind of mud called sediment.

Over time (like, millions and millions of years!), the sediment got more and more layers on top of it. The pressure from all those layers turned the creature's body into a hard, stone-like thing called a fossil!

Think of it like this: imagine you have a toy car, and you put it under a big pile of dirt and leaves for a really long time. When you dig it up again, you might find that the dirt and leaves have squished the car into a flat, hard shape. That's kinda like what happens to animals when they become fossils!

Fossils are like magic pictures from a long, long time ago. They help us learn about the creatures that used to live on Earth, and what their world was like.

Isn't that COOL?
<end>

Explain the skeletal system like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about bones!

So, you know how we have a body that can move around and do things? Like walk, run, and play?

Well, all of those things are made possible by something called the SKELETAL SYSTEM! 

The skeletal system is like a special framework that helps hold our body together. It's made up of many tiny bones that fit together like a big puzzle!

Imagine you have a bunch of connected building blocks. That's kind of what the skeleton looks like inside your body.

Here are some cool things about the skeletal system:

1. **It helps us stand up straight!** The skeleton gives our body support and keeps us standing tall.
2. **It lets us move around!** The bones in our legs, hips, and spine help us walk, run, and even do flips (if you're super cool like that!)
3. **It protects our important parts!** Our skull is like a hard hat that keeps our brain safe inside!
4. **It helps us grow strong!** As we grow bigger and stronger, the skeletal system grows with us!

Some of the main bones in the skeleton are:

* The head (skull)
* The spine
* The ribs (which help protect our heart and lungs!)
* The hips and legs
* The arms (including hands)

That's a basic look at the amazing skeletal system! Do you have any questions about it?
<end>

Explain nitrogen like I'm five years old.<start>Nitrogen is a special kind of air that we breathe.

You know how we need oxygen to breathe, right? Like when we're playing outside and running around?

Well, nitrogen is also in the air, but it's not as important for us to breathe as oxygen. It's like having two types of invisible helpers that are always with us!

Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the air around us! That's a big number! But because our bodies don't need it as much as oxygen, we can still be just fine even if there's not as much nitrogen.

Imagine you have a magic balloon filled with balloons. Some of those balloons are special "oxygen balloons" that help keep you happy and healthy when you breathe in. And some of them are "nitrogen balloons". They're still important because they help keep the air safe for us to breathe, but we don't need as many of them.

That's basically nitrogen! It's a big part of the air we have around us all the time!
<end>

Explain geothermal energy like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you going to love this!

So, you know how sometimes it's hot outside and we have to turn on the air conditioner to cool down? And then there are times when it's really cold and we have to turn on the heater to warm up?

Well, the Earth is like a big ball, and inside that ball, there's a lot of heat. It's like the Earth has its own special oven! This heat comes from deep down in the Earth, where it's been building up for millions and millions of years.

Geothermal energy is when we use this heat to make electricity or warm water. We dig a hole (called a well) into the ground to reach that hot stuff inside the Earth. Then, we send water through the well, and as it passes by the hot rocks and earth, it gets really hot too! When the hot water comes out of the well, it's like hot water from your faucet, but instead of using electricity to make it hot, it's all thanks to the Earth!

We can use this hot water to power a special machine that makes electricity. It's kind of like a giant fan that uses the heat energy to spin around and generate power! The electricity is then sent through wires to our homes, schools, and other buildings.

So, geothermal energy is like using the Earth's own oven to make electricity or warm water, without burning any coal, gas, or oil. Isn't that cool?
<end>

Explain the seasons like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about THE SEASONS!

You know how sometimes it's warm and sunny outside, and sometimes it's cold and snowy? That's because of something called the "seasons".

There are four special seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn (or Fall), and Winter.

**Spring**

In the spring, the Earth starts to wake up from its long winter sleep. The sun shines brighter, and the flowers start to bloom! It's like a big garden party outside!

**Summer**

In the summer, it's WARM and SUNNY most of the time! We go swimming, play outside with our friends, and have picnics in the park. It's like one long, happy day after another!

**Autumn (or Fall)**

As summer ends, the leaves on the trees start to turn into beautiful colors – red, yellow, orange, and brown! It's like nature is painting a big picture just for us! The air gets cooler, and we might even get some yummy apples from the trees.

**Winter**

In the winter, it can get really COLD outside! We wear our warmest coats, hats, and gloves to keep ourselves cozy. Sometimes it even snows! It's like a magical wonderland, where you can build snowmen, make snowballs, and go sledding down hills!

So, that's what the seasons are like! Each one is special and fun in its own way.

Which season do YOU like best?
<end>

Explain probability like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you going to love this!

So, you know how sometimes we do things and they happen, and sometimes they don't? Like, if you flip a coin, it might land on heads or tails.

Well, "probability" is just a big word that means how likely something is to happen. It's like a magic number that tells us how sure we are that something will happen.

Let me give you an example:

Imagine you have a jar of 10 cookies, and 7 of them are chocolate chip. If I ask you if the next cookie out of the jar will be chocolate chip or not, you can look at the jar and say... "I think it's pretty likely that it will be chocolate chip!" And that's because there are 7 chocolate chip cookies for every 3 other kinds of cookies.

So, the probability of getting a chocolate chip cookie is 7 out of 10, or 70%. That means if you reach in and grab a cookie, there's a pretty good chance it will be yummy chocolate chip!

But if I asked you to guess what color your shirt is... well, that's not as easy! You might have a blue shirt, but then again, maybe not. In that case, the probability of getting a blue shirt would be more like 50% - either way could happen.

So, probability is just a way to talk about how likely something is to happen, using numbers to make it clearer!

Does that make sense?
<end>

Explain latitude like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you ready for a fun geography lesson?

So, you know how we live on a big ball called the Earth, right? And it's round, like a big ball.

Now, imagine you're standing outside and looking up at the sky. You can see the sun shining down on you, but have you ever noticed that sometimes the sun seems to be higher in the sky than other times?

That's because of something called latitude!

Latitude is like a big imaginary line that goes around the Earth. It helps us figure out how far north or south we are.

Imagine a big strip of lines all around the globe, like a big piece of paper with lots of parallel lines on it. That's kind of what latitude looks like.

When you're standing on the North Pole, you're really close to one end of that line. When you're standing on the South Pole, you're at the other end!

And then there are lots of places in between, where people live and play and have fun. Like New York City, or Paris, or Sydney.

So, latitude is like a big address for our planet, telling us exactly how far north or south we are!
<end>

Explain mixtures like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about MIXTURES!

So, you know how we can see different things in the world around us? Like apples and toys?

Well, a mixture is when we take two or more of these things and put them together to make something new.

For example, let's say we mix some red juice with some blue juice. What happens?

You get... PINK JUICE!

We didn't create a new toy or an apple, but we created something new by mixing the juices together! And this pink liquid is still like juice, but it's different from just being red or just being blue.

Mixtures can be made with lots of things: toys, blocks, sand, even PLAYDOUGH!

When we mix two things together, we get a new thing that has some qualities from each one. Like the pink juice having some sweetness from the red juice and some fun color from the blue juice.

So, that's what mixtures are! Do you have any favorite examples of mixtures?
<end>

Explain the brain like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you going to love learning about the brain!

So, you know how you can think, feel happy, sad, and do all sorts of things without even thinking about it? Like, you can run around outside and play with your friends?

Well, that's all because of a special computer called the brain! It's like a super cool, tiny control room inside your head.

The brain is made up of lots of little parts, but let me tell you about the most important ones:

1. **Thinker**: This part helps you think and remember things. It's like having a magic library inside your head where all your memories are stored!
2. **Feelings**: This part helps you feel happy, sad, or even hungry! It's like having a special feelings button that says, "Hey, I'm feeling happy today!"
3. **Movements**: This part helps you move around and do things like walk, run, and dance!

Imagine the brain is like a boss who makes all these parts work together to help you do all sorts of cool stuff! Like, it can tell your legs to move so you can run after a ball, or it can make you feel happy when you see your favorite toy.

But here's the really cool thing about the brain: **YOU CAN HELP IT GROW STRONGER**! When you play games, learn new things, and exercise, it's like giving your brain special food to help it grow big and strong!

So, that's what the brain is like! It's a super cool, magic computer inside your head that helps you do all sorts of amazing things.
<end>

Explain quantum computing like I'm five years old.<start>Oh boy, are you ready for a cool explanation?

You know how we use computers to play games and do things? Like, your mom might use one to look at recipes or pay bills.

A regular computer is like a librarian who helps us find books on shelves. The computer looks through all the books (or information) and finds the right one for what you want to do.

A quantum computer is like a SUPER-SPECIAL LIBRARIAN who can look through ALL THE BOOKS AT THE SAME TIME! And not just that, but it can also talk to all the other special librarians in the world at the same time too!

Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and each LEGO brick has a special color. A regular computer would be like looking at one brick, then another brick, then another... until it finds the right colored brick for what you want.

A quantum computer is like using MAGIC to make all the bricks change colors at the same time! So, instead of looking at each brick one by one, the quantum computer can look at ALL THE BRICKS AND THEIR COLORS AT ONCE!

This means that a quantum computer can solve problems that would take a regular computer a very long time (or even forever!) to figure out. It's like having a superpower for solving puzzles and mysteries!

Does that make sense?
<end>

Explain insomnia like I'm five years old.<start>So, you know how sometimes we go to sleep at night and our bodies get to rest? That's because our bodies are tired from playing and having fun all day!

Well, some people have a problem where they can't fall asleep at night. This is called insomnia. It's like their brain says, "Hey, I don't want to sleep yet! Let's play or think about fun things instead!"

When that happens, it can be hard for the person to fall asleep and get the rest their body needs. They might lie awake in bed, thinking about all sorts of things, but not being able to relax and drift off to dreamland.

It's like trying to close a jar that won't shut tight! The brain just won't turn off, and it makes it hard to fall asleep. But don't worry, there are things we can do to help fix insomnia, like going for walks during the day, not using phones or screens before bed, and doing special relaxing activities at night!

Does that make sense?
<end>

Explain programming like I'm five years old.<start>Let's talk about programming!

Imagine you have a toy box full of blocks, and inside that box, there are different types of blocks: red blocks, blue blocks, green blocks, and yellow blocks. Each block has a special job to do.

**What is programming?**

Programming is like writing instructions on how to use those blocks to build something cool! Like a castle, a spaceship, or even just a really tall tower!

Just like you would tell your friend how to build a castle with the blocks, programmers write instructions that computers can understand. These instructions are called "code".

**How do we give instructions?**

We use special words and symbols to tell the computer what to do. It's like writing a secret code that only the computer can understand!

For example, let's say you want to build a tower with 5 red blocks on top of each other. You would write:

1. Take 5 red blocks from the box.
2. Stack them on top of each other.

The computer reads these instructions and follows them step by step to build your tower!

**What kind of things can we program?**

Oh, so many cool things! We can program games like Minecraft or Roblox. We can even create robots that can move around and do tasks for us! The possibilities are endless!

Programming is like being a master builder, but instead of using blocks, we use special instructions to tell the computer what to do. And just like how you can build anything with your blocks, programmers can create amazing things with their code!

How was that? Do you have any questions about programming now?
<end>

Explain metals like I'm five years old.<start>METALS ARE SO COOL!

So, you know how we have toys and stuff that are made of different materials? Like blocks, dolls, and cars?

Well, metals are a special kind of material that is super strong and can be molded into lots of shapes.

Imagine playing with playdough. You can squish it, stretch it, and mold it into all sorts of things. That's kinda like what happens when we work with metals!

Metals are made from tiny particles called atoms that stick together to form a solid. And just like how different toys have different textures and properties, metals have different properties too.

Some examples of metals are:

* Iron (like the iron in your mom's kitchen)
* Copper (like the pennies you get as money)
* Gold (super valuable and shiny!)
* Aluminum (like the cans we recycle)

Metals can be used to make all sorts of things, like toys, tools, cars, airplanes, and even buildings! They're super strong and can withstand a lot of wear and tear.

And guess what? Some metals are even good at conducting electricity, which means they can help carry energy from one place to another. That's why we have metal wires in our homes to power all the things we use!

So, isn't it awesome how metals can be used for so many different things and help make our lives easier and more fun?
<end>

Explain the Periodic Table like I'm five years old.<start>Let me explain something SUPER COOL to you!

You know how we have lots of different kinds of toys, like cars and dolls and blocks? Well, the world is full of tiny things called "elements" that are like building blocks for everything around us! And just like how we can categorize our toys into groups (like cars or dolls), scientists grouped all these elements together in a special chart called the Periodic Table!

The Periodic Table looks like a big square with lots of rows and columns. It's kind of like a grid, but not quite as boring! Imagine you're at a huge library where every book has a special label on it, and that's basically what we have here.

The elements are all listed in a specific order, from left to right and top to bottom. They get grouped together based on how similar they are. It's like putting toys with wheels together, because they can roll around! And then there are toys with strings or sticks, because you can swing them!

Some of the groups have special names too:

* The first column is called "alkali metals". These elements are super good at making things conduct electricity (like a toy car with flashing lights!).
* The next group has some really cool elements that are like superheroes – they're really good at changing color or reacting to other elements (like magic markers!).
* And then there's the big column in the middle, which is called "noble gases". These elements are super calm and don't usually react with anything else (like a sleepy teddy bear!).

The Periodic Table has 118 different elements in it – that's as many kinds of building blocks as we have! Scientists use this chart to help them understand how all these elements work together, like puzzle pieces.

Wow, isn't the Periodic Table just AMAZING?
<end>

Explain the nervous system like I'm five years old.<start>Let me tell you about the NERVOUS SYSTEM!

Your body has a super cool way to send messages from one part of your body to another. It's like having a special messenger team that can say "Hey, I'm hungry!" or "I'm feeling tired!"

This team is called the nervous system. It's made up of tiny little roads (called nerves) that are all connected together like a big highway.

When you want to do something, like move your arm or talk to your friend, it sends a message through these nerves to tell your body what to do. And then... MAGIC! Your body does it!

Here's how it works:

1. You think about doing something (like "I want ice cream!").
2. Your brain gets the message and says, "Oh, you want ice cream? Let me send a message!"
3. The nerves carry this message to different parts of your body (like your hands).
4. When they get there, they say, "Hey, it's time for ice cream!" And then... you go get some!

The nervous system is like a special team that helps you move, feel things, and even talk! It's super important, and we're all thankful to have it.

Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about how the nervous system works?
<end>
